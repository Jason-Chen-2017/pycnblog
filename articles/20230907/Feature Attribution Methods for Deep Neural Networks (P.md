深度学习模型的训练过程中，通过反向传播可以获得每个权值对预测结果的影响。因此，根据梯度下降法的迭代更新规则，特征重要性分析主要研究如何衡量和解释模型权值的重要程度。从最初的利用微分几何方法来描述网络权值的重要性，到后来的利用正则化方法的局部加权回归（LOWR）方法，再到最近的研究方向——基于重要性方法，都涉及到了特征重要性的概念和分析。下面是一些相关的研究成果。

(1) Gradient-based attribution method:

Gradient-based attribution methods measure the importance of a feature based on its gradient with respect to the loss function during training. Some popular gradient-based methods include the Saliency Map [1] and Integrated Gradients [2]. The former computes the absolute value of gradients for each pixel in an image, while the latter averages over all pixels along their straight lines paths that pass through the unit activation of neuron layers or channels of interest. 

(2) Neuron-based attribution method:

Neuron-based attribution methods use information from individual neurons to explain their contribution to the prediction error. Popular neuron-based methods include Guided Backpropagation [3], SmoothGrad [4] and Deconvolutional Network [5]. They iteratively assign weights to input features and backpropagate them through network layers until reaching the desired output neuron, then interpret the effect of these assigned weights as the important factors behind the predicted class label.

(3) Filter-based attribution method:

Filter-based attribution methods consider local patterns detected by filters in convolutional neural networks (CNN). One example is CAM (Class Activation Mapping), which assigns different weights to activations within a CNN layer to obtain a heatmap of regions contributing most towards the final classification decision. Another approach is LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) [6], which creates linear regression models locally around test samples to approximate the predictions made by the model.

In this paper, we will focus on two types of gradient-based attribution methods: global and local approaches. Global methods use the entire gradient vector instead of selecting only one unit/filter. Local methods select only a small subset of units/filters and estimate the gradient vector from it. We will also discuss two specific cases: integrated gradients and deconvNet. 

3.关键术语和定义

符号说明：

- $t$ : Time step
- $\alpha$: Step size 
- $\mathbf{x}_i^k$: Input sample kth time step i.e., $\mathbf{x}_{ij}^k$ for images $\mathbf{X}$
- $\delta_{ij}^l$: Partial derivative of $\mathbf{x}_i^k$ wrt the $j$-th channel/neuron $l$. For instance, if $\mathbf{x}_{ij}^k$ denotes a color channel, then $\delta_{ij}^l$ represents how changing a single pixel affects the activation of the corresponding neuron in the $l$-th layer. 

**Integrated gradients**:

The key idea behind Integrated Gradients is to compute attributions as a weighted sum of partial derivatives along the path between the baseline ($\bar{\mathbf{x}}$) and the input $\mathbf{x}$. This provides more accurate attributions than computing the same quantity using either gradients alone or using randomly perturbed inputs. Here's the equation:

$$a_j = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}R(\mathbf{x}_t^*\odot\mathbf{g}_{tj})-\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}R(\bar{\mathbf{x}})\prod_{t'=1}^{t}(1-\alpha\delta_{ij}^l(\mathbf{x}_{t'}^*))^{\gamma t'-1}$$

where:

- $R(\cdot)$ is a ReLU function applied elementwise across the input space;
- $\mathbf{g}_{tj}$ is the j-th component of the gradient of the logit at the current input $\mathbf{x}_t^*$ multiplied by the mask $m$ (which can be set to 1 for the selected channel);
- $(1-\alpha\delta_{ij}^l(\mathbf{x}_{t'}^*))^{\gamma t'-1}$ is the cumulative product of terms where $\delta_{ij}^l$ corresponds to the first $t'$ steps of the path between $\bar{\mathbf{x}}$ and $\mathbf{x}_t^*$ after multiplying by the weight parameter $\alpha$, capped exponentially with $\gamma$;
- $\mathbf{x}_t^*$ is obtained by adding the scaled difference $\epsilon_{ti}$ between the baseline and the current input ($\mathbf{x}_t=\mathbf{x}_i+\epsilon_{ti}$), multiplied by the mask $m$ and dividing by $\|\|m\|\|$;

We can see from the above equations that Integrated Gradients first generates a sequence of approximated trajectories, starting from the baseline $\bar{\mathbf{x}}$ up to the target input $\mathbf{x}_i$, by taking a weighted combination of the random direction vectors $\epsilon_{ti}$, computed using the difference between the baselines and the inputs. Then, for each trajectory, it estimates the gradient of the logit score $\mathbf{g}_{tj}$ over the selected channel $j$, and applies a weighted sum across all components according to the number of time steps. Finally, the result is multiplied by the difference in output scores before and after applying the mask, and divided by the total length of the path to obtain an interpretable explanation. 


**DeconvNet:**

DeconvNet uses the concept of guided backpropagation to propagate an interpretation signal backwards through the network to identify which regions of the input are important for determining the output class. It does so by identifying the specific filters responsible for detecting salient features in a particular region of the input, such as edges or textures, and assigning higher weights to those filter outputs when propagating the interpretation signal backward through the rest of the network. 

Here's how it works: given an input $\mathbf{x}_i$, the algorithm performs forward propagation through the network to produce a probability distribution over classes. To interpret the model's predictions, the algorithm selects the top K filters that contributed most towards the correct classification decision, and sets the remaining filters to zero. Next, the algorithm propagates the interpreted signal backwards through the rest of the network, setting the weights of unimportant filters to zero, effectively highlighting important parts of the input image. 

The intuition behind this method is similar to Integrated Gradients, but involves the addition of additional constraints. Specifically, rather than looking at all possible directions from the input to the output, DeconvNet looks specifically for the areas that activate certain filter outputs, which represent objects and textures in the original image. 

Overall, both Integrated Gradients and DeconvNet provide valuable insights into why a particular part of the input caused a particular outcome, allowing developers to gain understanding of complex problems like object recognition and medical diagnosis.
