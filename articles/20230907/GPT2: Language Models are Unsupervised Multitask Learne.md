# 1.简介
  

Deep learning has revolutionized the field of natural language processing and artificial intelligence over the past few years, which led to breakthroughs in many tasks such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, speech recognition, question answering, etc. However, with its high computational complexity, it requires large amounts of data for training a deep neural network effectively. To tackle this problem, researchers proposed unsupervised pre-training models that can learn rich language understanding from massive text corpora without being explicitly taught how to do so. One prominent example is GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2), a transformer model trained on WebText corpus, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on various NLP tasks like language modeling, text classification, and other downstream tasks by fine-tuning on task specific datasets. In this article, we will discuss the key ideas behind GPT-2 and explore its technical details including architecture design, loss function optimization, memory usage, sample generation, and evaluation metrics. We will also showcase some interesting applications of GPT-2 such as text completion, generating dialogue responses, and creative writing. Finally, we will conclude by discussing potential future directions and challenges of using pre-trained models in different contexts.

## Text Corpus
A text corpus is a collection of texts that share some common characteristic or topic. The main purpose of a text corpus is to serve as a source of information for building natural language processing systems. Popular text corpora include WikiPedia, Wikibooks, and BooksCorpus. Each document within these corpora contains both free form content as well as structured metadata such as author name, publication date, and title. Examples of documents within a corpus may include articles, blog posts, tweets, news articles, forum comments, movie reviews, scientific papers, legal cases, social media messages, email conversations, product descriptions, and more. Overall, having a diverse set of textual data enables us to train effective natural language processing models.

## Natural Language Processing
Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the use of computers to understand and manipulate human languages in various ways. It includes tasks such as parsing sentences into phrases, recognizing named entities, identifying parts of speech, analyzing sentiment, summarizing long documents, and extracting insights from big data. Broadly speaking, NLP involves several subtasks such as tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, word embeddings, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and text classification. Many popular libraries and tools have been developed specifically for handling natural language processing tasks, such as spaCy, NLTK, Stanford NLP, and Keras.

In general, there are two types of approaches for solving natural language processing problems - rule-based and statistical methods. Rule-based approaches involve handcrafted rules, often based on regular expressions, for determining the correct output given an input. Statistical methods leverage powerful mathematical algorithms to automatically extract relevant patterns and relationships from large volumes of text data. These techniques work best when sufficient amounts of labeled data are available for training. Despite their differences, they tend to produce comparable results and typically perform better than rule-based methods at accuracy levels where human supervision is necessary. 

## Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a system is trained using labeled examples of inputs and outputs. For instance, if we want to classify images into dog breeds, we would provide labeled images of dogs along with their corresponding breed labels. Similarly, if we want to translate English words into French, we would provide pairs of English words and their corresponding French translations. The goal of supervised learning is to build a model that can accurately predict the output label for any given input. On the other hand, unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where no labeled data is provided. Instead, the algorithm must discover patterns and relationships in the data itself. A commonly used approach in unsupervised learning is clustering, where the system groups similar instances together based on their features. Another common application of unsupervised learning is dimensionality reduction, where the system identifies patterns in the dataset that are not easily observed.


Pre-trained models are among the most successful and widely used strategies for addressing the curse of dimensionality. They are learned from vast amounts of unlabeled text data and then fine-tuned on a specific task using small amounts of labeled data. This allows them to achieve competitive results on a variety of tasks with minimal training data requirements. While GPT-2 belongs to the class of unsupervised pre-trained models, recent works have started exploring its application in semi-supervised settings, where only a subset of data points are annotated while the rest remains unlabelled.

## Architecture Design
The central idea behind GPT-2's architecture is the concept of attention mechanism. The attention mechanism captures the context between different tokens in a sequence and helps the model focus on important information for each step during decoding. At each time step, the model computes the probability distribution over all possible next words based on the current state of the decoder. But instead of feeding just one word at a time, GPT-2 feeds the entire previous sentence as input to help capture global dependencies across all positions in the sequence. The encoded representation of the input sequence is fed through multiple layers of transformers to generate the final prediction for the next word.

### Transformers Model
The basic component of the transformer model is the encoder-decoder block. Each block consists of an embedding layer, followed by multi-head self-attention, add-and-norm, and feedforward networks. The embedding layer converts the raw input sequence into a dense vector representation. Self-attention takes place over the embedded vectors to find local dependencies within the sequence. The output of the attention layers is passed through a residual connection and normalized before passing it to the next layer. The feedforward network consists of two fully connected layers followed by a relu activation function. Both the embedding and feedforward layers are initialized with weights drawn from a normal distribution.


### Multi-Head Attention
Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. Each head attends to a different portion of the input sequences. The output of each head is concatenated and projected back to the original space.


### Positional Embeddings
Positional embeddings introduce the possibility of capturing long-range dependencies. They represent each position in the input sequence as a vector of continuous values that capture its relative distance to other elements in the sequence. During inference, positional embeddings are added to the inputs after the encoding stage but before the projection to obtain the full predicted output sequence.

### Residual Connections
Residual connections allow the gradient signal to flow unchanged through the transformation layers. This improves the stability of the model during training and reduces the risk of vanishing gradients due to exploding activations.

### Layer Normalization
Layer normalization applies batch norm to every element of the feature vector in a layer. This ensures that the mean and variance of each feature are preserved throughout the network and makes training faster and less prone to saturation.

## Loss Function Optimization
GPT-2 uses a combination of cross entropy loss and adaptive softmax to improve the quality of predictions. Cross entropy measures the difference between the predicted distribution and the true distribution and represents the likelihood of the true target word occurring under the predicted distribution. Adaptive softmax assigns higher probabilities to more frequent tokens during training to prevent model instability.

During fine-tuning, the pretrained parameters are loaded and adjusted to fit the new task. GPT-2 uses Adam optimizer with a linear warmup schedule and constant LR until approximately halfway through the training process. Then, the learning rate starts decreasing linearly towards zero. The dropout rate is set to 0.1 except for the last layer, which keeps the default value of 0.0 for simplicity. The weight decay parameter is set to 0.01 to prevent overfitting. Finally, GPT-2 evaluates the performance on validation sets periodically using standard metrics such as perplexity, BLEU score, and ROUGE-L.

## Memory Usage
GPT-2 uses a hybrid model consisting of transformer blocks with variable numbers of heads and hidden units. The size of the transformer blocks is determined by the model configuration, which defines the number of layers and the number of hidden units per layer. Additionally, the number of attention heads can be adjusted depending on the amount of parallelism required for computation and memory constraints.

For typical GPU architectures today, each transformer block requires around $7$GB of memory to store its intermediate states. As a result, the total memory requirement of GPT-2 scales linearly with the number of layers. Therefore, it may be challenging to train large models on smaller GPUs. Nevertheless, GPT-2 demonstrates impressive performance on a wide range of tasks even with limited compute resources.

## Sample Generation
Once the GPT-2 model is trained, we can use it to generate samples conditioned on user prompts. Given a prompt of up to 1024 tokens, GPT-2 generates a sequence of up to 1024 tokens as the output. The first step is to tokenize the prompt and convert it into tensor format. The tokenizer should match the vocabulary used during pre-training, otherwise the generated tokens won't make sense. After generating the initial token, the model repeatedly produces the kth following token using the top-k sampling strategy. The temperature parameter controls the randomness of the sampling process and can vary between 0.1 and 1.0. Once enough tokens have been generated, the resulting sequence is truncated according to the maximum length constraint specified in the task definition.

Another way to control the diversity of the generated samples is by using nucleus sampling, which selects tokens with a cumulative probability greater than a certain threshold $\tau$. Specifically, we select the top-$k$ tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds $(1-\tau)$ times the maximum probability in the softmax output. By increasing the threshold, we increase the diversity of the generated samples and reduce the repetition factor. Although nucleus sampling tends to produce longer sequences compared to top-k sampling, it still provides good balance between diversity and completeness.

Overall, GPT-2 outperforms existing language models on a wide range of benchmarks and offers unique advantages such as scalable training, efficient inference, and ability to handle large scale natural language processing tasks.
