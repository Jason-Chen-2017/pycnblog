# 1.简介
  

Computational fluid dynamics is one of the most important areas in physics and engineering that deals with simulations of physical phenomena involving fluids. It has applications in a wide range from traffic flow to medical treatment to space exploration. CFD simulates fluid behavior such as flows, heat transfer, pressure distribution, turbulence and stability in a variety of different environments. To run realistic CFD simulations efficiently and effectively, parallel computing is required. In this course we will learn how to use parallel programming techniques in Python for solving complex CFD problems by implementing the widely used finite volume method and several popular immersed boundary methods like the Navier-Stokes equations. We also cover topics related to distributed computing using Hadoop or Spark, and other relevant tools and libraries like mpi4py or Dask. The goal of this course is to enable students who have some experience with Python to quickly get up to speed on parallel and distributed computing in CFD. By the end of this course, they should be able to apply their knowledge to solve more complex CFD simulations on larger-scale clusters without having to deal with low level details of memory management and performance optimization.

# 3. Organizational Structure and Grading Criteria
This course can be taught in a few different ways depending on your specific needs and audience. Here's an example organizational structure and grading criteria:

## 3.1 Lectures and Readings
The first week of class will cover a general overview of computational fluid dynamics, including why it's important, what it involves, and how it works. We'll then focus on the basic theory behind the finite volume and immersed boundary methods. Next, we'll spend time discussing advanced topics like vector field visualization, time integration techniques, and pseudo-spectral methods. Then, we'll dive into more detailed technical discussions of each algorithm and implement them in Python. Finally, we'll wrap up with a brief summary of everything covered so far and discuss where to go next.

Reading assignments will consist of background literature reviews of key papers and textbooks, plus short chapters or sections of books dedicated specifically to certain parts of CFD. These readings will help ensure that you're fully prepared for the lectures and discussions, and may even lead to additional questions if there's anything unclear about a particular topic. You should come to class ready to ask any question you might have. If something seems too challenging, please seek assistance before asking for help!

### Assignments
There will be weekly assignments due at midnight Eastern Time on Wednesdays, which will mostly involve writing code to implement algorithms discussed during the lecture. Some of these assignments will require prior experience with either NumPy or PyTorch, while others will simply revise material covered previously. To encourage collaboration between students, all homework assignments will be assigned on GitHub repositories and released around noon Thursday for everyone to see and contribute to. After each assignment, we'll review the code together and provide feedback based on both correctness and clarity. At the very least, every student must write code to implement the algorithms presented in the lectures themselves, though some may also choose to improve upon existing implementations or add new features.

To measure student progress, each assignment will contain a number of automated tests that check whether the implementation is correct, given some input test cases. You can think of these tests as forming part of a suite of regression tests that ensures that future changes to the code don't break its functionality. This way, we can catch errors early rather than after the fact. Also, keep track of the total number of lines of code written and commented throughout the semester, along with testing coverage metrics like unit tests and branch coverage. These measures will let us evaluate student growth over time, identify patterns of learning, and plan improvements accordingly.

Overall, this approach will make sure that the content remains fresh and relevant, and that everyone learns something valuable.
