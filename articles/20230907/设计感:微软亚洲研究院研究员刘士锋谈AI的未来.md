## 概要
Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) 近年来对人工智能领域的研究已经取得了显著成果，包括端到端学习、强化学习、脑机接口等众多研究方向。在这一过程中，刘士锋同学就提出了一个很有意义的问题，即人工智能是否会成为主流？为了回答这个问题，他从人工智能发展的历史角度谈起，指出人工智能将会进入四种主要发展路径中的一种或几种。这些路径分别是量子计算、认知工程、人机交互和机器学习。

为了更好地理解人工智能的未来，刘士锋同学还向大家展示了当前正在进行的几个重大课题研究：智能社会助理、零售机器人、数字孪生生命体等。他认为，AI应用于物流管理、医疗健康和其他方面将会带来颠覆性的变革。另外，可以预见的是，未来的智能医疗将越来越依赖于人工智能技术。因此，无论如何，人工智能都将继续推进自身的发展道路。

但是，不得不承认，人工智能发展离不开人的参与和积极的探索。因此，只有科研工作者紧密结合产业、学术界与工业界的需求、发展趋势和实际场景，才能让人工智能真正引爆市场、改变世界。因此，希望通过本文分享一些与人工智能相关的想法，希望能够帮助更多读者了解人工智能的最新进展，进而对其发展方向产生更加清晰的认识。
# 2.人工智能的历史回顾
## 2.1 人工智能之父——图灵奖获得者莱斯利·范瑞威森的一段话
>In the beginning was the word ‘Computers’ and ‘Intelligence’; now it is called Artificial Intelligence, or AI. The year is 1956, and a Cognitive Science researcher named <NAME> is looking back at his experiences in developing artificial intelligence. He says that he had three major milestones in mind when developing this field: 

1. Machine Learning – A field of study where computers can learn to perform tasks on their own, without being explicitly programmed.

2. Natural Language Processing – A technology for understanding human language and processing natural text into machine-readable formats.

3. Cybernetics – The study of how computers communicate with each other over vast networks. 

After making these milestones, Murray went on to develop the first ever practical system for creating and training neural networks - known as “The PDP-1”. However, development continued rapidly since then, leading to several breakthroughs such as the Deep Blue chess engine that beat human champions by a score of more than one million pawns.

It's worth noting that there are many facets to what makes for an AI system to be considered successful. Some examples include: data collection, model architecture selection, algorithmic optimization, error handling, etc. Nonetheless, all of these components form a large part of any successful AI project, and they have given rise to a great deal of interest in building smart machines that can do complex tasks and reason abstractly. Despite these successes, recent events in both technology and society have challenged some of the assumptions behind current AI theory and systems.
