### 4. 数学模型和公式 & 详细讲解 & 举例说明

In this section, we will delve into the mathematical models and formulas that underpin the algorithms discussed in the previous section. We will provide a detailed explanation of each model and illustrate their usage with practical examples.

#### Mathematical Model 1: K-Means Clustering

K-means clustering is a popular algorithm used for customer segmentation. It aims to partition a dataset into K clusters, where each cluster is represented by the centroid of the data points within it.

**Model Formula:**

$$
\text{Cluster centroids} = \bar{x}_k = \frac{1}{N_k} \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i
$$

where $x_i$ is the ith data point, $N_k$ is the number of data points in the kth cluster, and $\bar{x}_k$ is the centroid of the kth cluster.

**Example:**

Suppose we have a dataset of customer preferences with three features: age, income, and spending habits. We want to segment these customers into two clusters using k-means clustering.

1. **Initial centroids:** Set initial centroids randomly or using heuristic methods.
2. **Assign data points to clusters:** Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
3. **Update centroids:** Recompute the centroids based on the assigned data points.
4. **Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence:** The algorithm converges when the centroids no longer change significantly.

#### Mathematical Model 2: Time Series Forecasting

Time series forecasting models, such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), are used to predict future values based on historical data. ARIMA models consist of three components: autoregression (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA).

**Model Formula:**

$$
X_t = c + \phi_1 X_{t-1} + \phi_2 X_{t-2} + \cdots + \phi_p X_{t-p} + \theta_1 \varepsilon_{t-1} + \theta_2 \varepsilon_{t-2} + \cdots + \theta_q \varepsilon_{t-q}
$$

where $X_t$ is the observed value at time t, $c$ is the constant term, $\phi_1, \phi_2, \cdots, \phi_p$ are the autoregressive coefficients, $\theta_1, \theta_2, \cdots, \theta_q$ are the moving average coefficients, and $\varepsilon_t$ is the error term.

**Example:**

Suppose we have a time series of daily sales data for a retail store. We want to forecast the next day's sales using an ARIMA model.

1. **Data preprocessing:** Check for stationarity by analyzing the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF). If necessary, apply differencing to stabilize the mean.
2. **Model selection:** Use statistical tests, such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), to select the best ARIMA model order (p, d, q).
3. **Model fitting:** Fit the ARIMA model to the historical data.
4. **Forecasting:** Use the fitted model to forecast future values.
5. **Validation:** Evaluate the forecast accuracy using metrics such as mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

#### Mathematical Model 3: Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis models, such as support vector machines (SVM) or deep learning models, classify text data into sentiment categories (e.g., positive, negative, neutral). These models learn from labeled data to predict the sentiment of new text samples.

**Model Formula:**

$$
y = \arg\max_w \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i \cdot \left(w^T x_i\right)
$$

where $y$ is the predicted sentiment category, $w$ is the model weight vector, $x_i$ is the feature vector for the ith text sample, and $y_i$ is the true sentiment category.

**Example:**

Suppose we have a dataset of customer reviews labeled as positive or negative. We want to build a sentiment analysis model to classify new reviews.

1. **Data preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the text data, converting it into numerical feature vectors.
2. **Model training:** Train a sentiment analysis model using labeled data. This can involve using techniques such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings to represent the text data.
3. **Model evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
4. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of new review samples.
