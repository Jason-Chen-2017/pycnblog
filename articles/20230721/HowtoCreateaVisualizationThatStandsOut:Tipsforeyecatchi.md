Data visualization is an important component of data communication and decision making in many industries such as finance, energy, healthcare, education, marketing, transportation, etc., where information is visualized through various charts, graphs, or other visual representations that provide easy insights into complex data sets. With the advent of more powerful devices with larger screens and high resolutions, businesses are increasingly relying on data visualization to inform their decisions and make critical business decisions based on accurate and comprehensive analysis. Therefore, it becomes essential for data analysts and data scientists to create visually engaging data visualizations that attract users’ attention and effectively communicate data findings. 

To deliver successful data visualizations, organizations need to follow best practices in terms of design, content selection, and presentation techniques. Here we will discuss some key principles and tips that can help you create visually appealing and informative data visualizations that stand out from the crowd. We believe these tips can help you turn your raw data into valuable information that delivers real value to stakeholders and improves decision-making processes. 

In this article, we will introduce several design principles and guidelines that should be followed when creating effective data visualizations. We will also demonstrate how to apply these principles and guidelines using popular data visualization libraries like D3.js, Tableau, and Google Charts. By following these steps, you can easily create stunning and impactful data visualizations that captivate users' interest and encourage them to explore further.

# 2.基本概念术语说明
Before diving into the actual process of creating data visualizations, let's first understand the basic concepts and terminologies involved in data visualization. 

2.1 Basic Terms & Concepts

2.1.1 Information
Information refers to any piece of knowledge or data that is available to us. It could be text, images, numerical values, audio clips, videos, etc. However, while creating data visualizations, our main focus should always be on the representation of the data itself. In other words, we want to highlight patterns, trends, and relationships within the data rather than simply displaying the data itself. This means that information needs to be processed and analyzed before being presented in a meaningful way.

2.1.2 Data Science & Analytics
Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that involves three pillars - extraction, transformation, and visualization of data. These three pillars enable companies to derive actionable insights from vast amounts of data by applying statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and visualizations. The goal of analytics is to extract useful patterns, trends, and insights from data in order to improve decision-making processes. The primary role of data scientists is to use advanced mathematical techniques to analyze large datasets, develop models, and identify hidden patterns and trends that may not have been visible to humans before.

2.1.3 Data Visualization
Data visualization is the graphical representation of data. It allows us to quickly and accurately convey complex ideas, relationships, and patterns within the data without losing context or nuances. Data visualization tools like charts, graphs, and maps allow us to view and analyze data across different dimensions, which makes it easier to identify trends and relationships. There are several types of data visualization techniques including bar charts, scatter plots, line charts, pie charts, box plots, heat maps, geographical maps, radar charts, and histograms. Each technique has its own set of strengths and weaknesses depending on the specific requirements of the dataset. For example, certain types of charts work well for displaying categorical data whereas others may work better for continuous data.

2.2 Design Principles & Guidelines

2.2.1 Simplicity
The most crucial aspect of data visualization is simplicity. Simply put, clear, concise, and informative graphics are preferred over bloated, detailed, and confusing ones. To achieve this, we can adopt simple color schemes, fonts, and layouts that reduce clutter and emphasize the essence of the data. Additionally, avoid unnecessary chart borders, shadows, and labels, and limit the number of colors used in the visualization to keep things fresh and interesting.

2.2.2 Readability
Another important aspect of data visualization is readability. As people spend much time looking at data visualizations, it is essential that they are easy to understand and interpret. Therefore, ensure that your data visualizations are accompanied by appropriate titles, legends, and annotations that explain the data. Use unambiguous language and avoid jargon and specialized terms whenever possible.

2.2.3 Interaction
One of the fundamental features of data visualization is interaction. Users must be able to zoom in on specific parts of the graph, filter out data points, or toggle between multiple views of the same data. Interactive charts allow users to interact with the data directly, providing greater flexibility and interactivity compared to static visualizations. Some commonly used interactive charts include scatter plots, line charts, stacked area charts, bar charts, bubble charts, and maps.

2.2.4 Consistency
Consistency is another important aspect of data visualization that ensures that all elements within the visualization have a similar look and feel. A consistent theme, font style, and layout should be applied throughout the entire visualization to maintain consistency and trustworthiness. Make sure that your chart choices reflect your brand personality and industry preferences.

2.2.5 Interpretation
The final aspect of data visualization is interpretation. Just like every good story requires careful consideration of plot, character, setting, and audience, interpreting data visualizations requires careful consideration of all aspects of the data and the message it contains. Provide explanations for each chart, use sophisticated tools like tooltips to display additional details about the data points, and add contextual information that provides relevant background information.

2.3 Common Tools

2.3.1 D3.js
D3 stands for Data-Driven Documents. It is a JavaScript library that enables developers to create dynamic and interactive data visualizations for web browsers. It offers a wide range of functionality, including support for SVG, HTML, and Canvas graphics, animation, and data manipulation. Popular d3.js libraries include Plotly, C3.js, and DC.js.

2.3.2 Tableau
Tableau is a business intelligence platform designed for data exploration and visualization. It includes built-in data connectors for popular databases, allowing users to connect to existing enterprise systems and pull data into Tableau for analysis. The user interface is intuitive and streamlined, making it easy to navigate and visualize data. Other features include customizable dashboard templates, interactive filters, and automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) capabilities.

2.3.3 Google Charts
Google Charts is a free software library that allows developers to generate high-quality data visualizations for websites and applications. Built-in chart types include line, column, bar, area, histogram, and pie charts. Developers can customize the appearance and behavior of the charts using CSS, JavaScript, and API options. Furthermore, it offers integration with Google Sheets, Excel, and Gmail, enabling users to import data directly into the chart editor.
