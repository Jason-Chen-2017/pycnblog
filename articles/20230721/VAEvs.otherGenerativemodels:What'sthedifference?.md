In recent years, generative modeling has emerged as a powerful approach to learn and represent complex data distributions. Traditional statistical approaches like maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) have been widely used for modeling density functions of data, but they may not be able to model complex non-Gaussian data well. To address this problem, various deep learning architectures have been proposed that aim at generating new samples from complex data distributions. 

One such family is the Variational Autoencoder (VAE), which was introduced in 2013 by <NAME> et al. The main idea behind VAEs is to learn the underlying probability distribution of a dataset through a probabilistic inference network. This allows us to generate new examples from any given input. However, VAEs are typically more complex than traditional generative models because they use variational inference techniques instead of MLE to approximate the true posterior over the latent variables. In this article we will discuss the key differences between VAEs and other popular generative models like GANs, AEs, and VQ-VAEs, along with their strengths and weaknesses.

## 2.1 Probabilistic Inference Networks
Probabilistic inference networks (PINNs) were first introduced by Khidma et al. in 2018. PINNs consist of an encoder-decoder architecture where an encoder maps the inputs into a set of parameters of a certain probability distribution, while a decoder generates samples based on these parameters. The goal of training the network is to minimize the divergence between the predicted distribution and the true one. 

The most common form of PINNs is the shallow neural network (DNN)-based type, in which the encoding function takes the input and produces a fixed-size vector representation, which then gets fed into a fully connected layer in the decoder part to produce the output sample(s). Although DNN-based PINNs can achieve good performance, they suffer from two limitations: 

1. Latent space dimensionality: The DNN-based PINN implicitly assumes that the latent space is very low-dimensional and cannot capture rich structure present in high-dimensional real world datasets.

2. Complexity: Since the network only considers the pointwise values of the inputs and does not explicitly define higher-order interactions or long-range dependencies between them, it becomes challenging to model highly non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. Therefore, DNN-based PINNs are limited to capturing smooth transformations of the inputs. 

To overcome these issues, researchers explored different types of generative models that attempt to directly model the joint distribution of inputs and latents using powerful functions like normalizing flows. These models use multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to parameterize both the prior and the flow transformations. While allowing for high-dimensional representations of the latent space, these models also require careful design of the prior to avoid vanishing gradients during training. Nevertheless, they offer several advantages over DNN-based PINNs, including better modeling of complex relationships and ability to handle non-stationary data.

## 2.2 Autoregressive Model (AR) and Flow Models
Autoregressive models (ARMs) are a class of generative models that assume a linear dependency between the random variables in each time step. They are commonly used to model sequential data, i.e., temporal series. One such example is autoregressive moving average (ARMA) process, in which each value in the sequence depends linearly on previous values up to some specified lag. ARMs provide a simple way to model long-term dependencies without explicitly defining higher-order terms or taking into account possible causality effects. Despite its simplicity, ARMs still show promise due to their ability to capture long-term patterns in data. 

Flow models are another class of generative models that exploit transformations to map inputs to outputs in a compact latent space, thereby enabling complex dependence structures to be learned. Normalizing flows were originally introduced by Kingma and Welling in 2015 as a way to construct invertible mappings between probability measures on sets of d dimensions. However, they quickly found themselves replacing naive transforms used in normal distribution models when the number of dimensions grows larger. Moreover, decoupling the modeling of the transformation and base distribution further enabled them to perform well on high-dimensional data even though they required additional tricks to optimize and train them efficiently. Nonetheless, flow models have proven to be effective in many applications ranging from image synthesis to speech generation, and are now becoming increasingly popular for unsupervised learning tasks.

## 2.3 Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
Variational autoencoders (VAEs) were initially introduced by Rezende and Mohamed in 2014. The basic idea behind VAEs is to learn a natural parametrization of the true data distribution by finding a suitable trade-off between compression and expressiveness. Specifically, VAEs encode the input data into a hidden code that captures the most important features of the data while minimizing redundancy in the encoded representation. Then, a decoding function is trained to recover the original data from the compressed code. The objective of the VAE is to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO), which is a lower bound on the logarithm of the marginal likelihood of the observed data under the assumed model. It is often referred to as the fundamental idea behind VAEs, and it is closely related to the beta-vae loss function, which encourages both the latent code and reconstruction to follow a unit Gaussian distribution.

Traditionally, VAEs operate in continuous latent spaces, meaning that the probability distributions being modeled are continuous and not discrete. However, modern VAE variants allow for discretized latent spaces, which enable efficient optimization and sampling operations. Furthermore, the existence of multiple modes within the latent space indicates that the learned distribution is multimodal, making it less likely to collapse into a single mode. Lastly, since VAEs involve an inference network, they can capture complex non-Gaussian data distributions beyond what is possible with traditional methods like mixture models.

Overall, VAEs are among the most successful generative models in modern machine learning and are currently a central component in numerous applications, including image synthesis, text-to-image generation, and language modeling.

Now let’s focus our attention on the core algorithmic principles behind VAEs and how they differ from other popular generative models. We will begin with an overview of the VAE architecture followed by detailed explanations of the key ideas behind the VAE framework. Next, we will talk about the working principle of the VAE and its relevance in describing complex data distributions. Finally, we will review some of the latest developments in VAEs and conclude the paper.
## 3.1 Overview of the VAE Architecture
Let’s start by understanding the overall architecture of the VAE. As shown in Figure 1, the VAE consists of three parts: 

1. An inference network that represents the mapping from the input to the latent space; 

2. A generative network that represents the mapping from the latent space back to the original input space; 

3. A stochastic encoder-decoder model that uses the inference network to compress the input data and the generative network to reconstruct it.

Note that while the VAE operates on the assumption that the input data follows a known probability distribution, the specific choice of the distribution does not affect the overall architecture. For instance, if we want to model a bernoulli random variable, we simply need to modify the final sigmoid activation in the generator function accordingly. Similarly, if we want to model a categorical random variable, we just need to change the softmax activation in the generator function.

## 3.2 Key Ideas Behind the VAE Framework
### Learning Meaningful Representations of Data
The goal of the VAE is to find a meaningful representation of the data that enables us to generate new examples from the same distribution. The standard generative model approach involves assuming a direct mapping between the input and output distributions, but VAEs seek to build a flexible and robust model that can capture complex non-gaussian data distributions. To do so, VAEs employ a recognition network called the encoder that learns a global representation of the input data and projects it onto a smaller latent space. During testing, the generated samples are decoded by the corresponding generator network that transforms the samples back into the original feature space. The idea behind representing the input data in a meaningful latent space is to capture relevant information in the input data while discarding irrelevant details. This makes the model more robust to perturbations and reduces the amount of memory required for storing the entire dataset.

### Dealing with Discrete Latent Variables
As mentioned earlier, VAEs are capable of handling discrete latent variables. This is achieved by changing the activation function used in the generator network to produce categorical distributions rather than continuous ones. Additionally, we can add extra layers to the generator network to ensure that the output corresponds to a valid probability distribution. The added layers could include a softmax activation for categorical outputs and a tanh activation for continuous ones.

### Handling High-Dimensional Inputs
Despite the fact that VAEs have been successfully applied to images and natural language processing tasks, they also work well with high-dimensional data such as financial data or genetics data. The reason is that VAEs can easily deal with high-dimensional inputs by reducing the dimensionality of the latent space and learning a shared representation across all features. The intuition is that by reducing the dimensionality of the input data, we lose some of the redundant information but retain enough information to reconstruct the data effectively. By combining multiple copies of the learned representation with varying weights, VAEs can capture more complex correlations between input features.

### Using an Approximation to Compute the True Posterior
One of the major challenges associated with building generative models is computing the true posterior distribution of the input data. In VAEs, the goal is to infer the parameters of the true posterior distribution without relying on exact closed-form solutions or approximations. Instead, VAEs rely on an approximation method called variational inference that works by approximating the true posterior distribution using simpler distributions. Specifically, VAEs create two new distributions: a mean field distribution that describes the expected value of the latent variables given the observed data, and a diagonal covariance distribution that specifies the variance of the latent variables. The goal of the inference network is to learn the parameters of these distributions such that they best match the empirical distribution of the observed data. Once the parameters are estimated, the ELBO provides a lower bound on the log-likelihood of the observed data under the inferred model. 

To make sense of this idea, consider the following scenario. Imagine you have a coin that lands heads with probability p = 0.5. You flip the coin ten times and observe five heads and four tails. How can you estimate the actual probability of heads? If you had to guess, you might say it must be around 0.8. But why did you choose 0.8 specifically? That would be too optimistic of course! Instead, we can try to estimate the actual probability of heads using a Bayesian approach and incorporate some prior beliefs into the calculation. One way to do this is to use a Dirichlet prior and fit the probability of heads to the observations using a conjugate prior. Another way is to use a Gamma prior and fit the precision of the observation counts to the parameters of the gamma distribution using a negative binomial likelihood. Both of these methods provide an approximation to the true posterior distribution but may be biased towards extreme values of p.

### Combining Multiple Copies of Learned Representation
Another advantage of VAEs compared to other generative models is their ability to combine multiple copies of the learned representation with varying weights. This technique enables the model to capture more complex correlation between input features and helps to generalize better to unseen data. Specifically, the weight assigned to each copy of the learned representation controls its contribution to the predicted output. When performing inference, we can assign different weights to each copy of the learned representation depending on the importance of individual features. This allows us to explore regions of the feature space that are more informative and suppress regions that are less useful for prediction. This can help improve the predictive power of the model and reduce overfitting.
