Data quality refers to the degree of accuracy, completeness, reliability, and validity of data inputs or outputs used by organizations for various business processes. Quality is critical as it impacts businesses' decision-making capability, costs, reputation, productivity, market share, and brand image. It also affects the effectiveness of internal controls, compliance with regulations, client expectations, and customer satisfaction. Without proper data quality management, organizations can face significant risks such as loss of revenue, lost sales opportunities, inaccurate reporting, and damaging effects on social and economic well-being. However, even small companies can struggle to meet stringent data quality standards due to lack of resources, expertise, and time. This article provides an overview of how regulatory bodies have defined requirements and best practices related to data quality control in industries that are subject to regulation, such as finance, healthcare, and transportation. The goal is to provide guidance to help identify potential pitfalls, suggest strategies for overcoming them, and create actionable plans for improving data quality within these sectors.

2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
In this section, we will introduce some basic concepts and terminology that may be helpful when reading the rest of the article.
Regulatory body - A government organization responsible for maintaining public order and ensuring the safety, security, and welfare of citizens. Examples include the US Federal Government (FDA), the UK Health Insurance Authority (HIA), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Regulatory authorities typically define policies, guidelines, and enforcement mechanisms that promote good practice in their respective fields while at the same time set benchmarks for data quality measures. Companies that engage in data-driven processes often undergo auditing by external regulators to ensure they adhere to established requirements and best practices. 

Data quality standard - A prescribed methodology for measuring the quality of data inputs or outputs used in a specific business process and establishing criteria for achieving acceptable levels of quality. These standards are often based on established best practices and may involve factors such as completeness, consistency, uniqueness, and reliability. Many regulatory bodies require firms to comply with data quality standards before allowing them to participate in certain activities, such as credit lending, loan origination, investment banking, or insurance purchasing. 

Data governance model - A framework that integrates data management, quality, and analytics functions across an enterprise to improve efficiency, enable self-service capabilities, and improve outcomes for stakeholders. It involves defining roles and responsibilities throughout the company, establishing clear communication channels, and implementing automated monitoring and analysis systems. 

3. Core Algorithm and Operations
The core algorithm used in data quality management includes statistical algorithms like Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Chi-squared test, and machine learning algorithms like decision trees, random forests, neural networks, and support vector machines. These algorithms can help identify data issues and suggest ways to correct them. Here are the steps involved in using each algorithm:

1) Statistical Algorithms: These algorithms compare two samples to determine if they come from the same population. They assume that the distributions of both samples are normally distributed and use mathematical formulas to calculate the distance between the two populations. If the samples do not match, there is likely to be differences in their distribution. Statistical tests evaluate whether differences in observed values arise because of sampling error or measurement error, i.e., random variation in the observations.

Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test - This test compares the cumulative distribution function of two sets of ordered observation points. It determines the maximum difference between the empirical CDFs of the two sets. A high value indicates that the two sets are significantly different.

Mann-Whitney U Test - This test applies to situations where one sample has categorical variables and the other has continuous variables. It compares medians of each group instead of comparing means, so it can handle cases where the distributions are skewed. It returns the minimum of three possible W-statistics: U_1, U_2, and U_min.

Chi-Squared Test - This test evaluates the relationship between two categorical variables. It calculates the probability of observing the given frequency count in one cell but not in another cell. A low value indicates that the variables are independent of each other.

Decision Trees - Decision trees are widely used in data mining and classification problems. They divide data into smaller subsets recursively until the target variable is classified correctly. Each split point defines a threshold for the attribute being considered and creates a branch leading to either true or false output depending on the result of the comparison. The algorithm automatically selects the most informative features for splitting nodes, which helps prevent overfitting.

Random Forests - Random forests combine multiple decision trees trained on random subsets of the training data to reduce variance and enhance generalization performance. The ensemble method combines the predictions of several trees to produce a final prediction. The greater number of trees reduces the risk of overfitting.

Neural Networks - Neural networks are deep artificial neural network models that work similar to decision trees. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes, where each node receives input from its previous layer, performs an activation function, and passes its output to the next layer. The activation function takes the weighted sum of all the incoming inputs, sums it up, and produces a signal that drives the neuron to fire or not fire. There are many variations of neural networks, including convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks.

2) Machine Learning Algorithms: Machine learning algorithms differ from traditional statistical methods because they learn patterns in data without requiring prior knowledge of the underlying distribution. They utilize labeled data to train a model, then apply the learned model to new unlabeled data to make predictions. This allows data quality experts to focus on identifying outliers and anomalies rather than attempting to predict every outcome.

Support Vector Machines - SVMs are a popular choice for binary classification tasks, such as spam detection or fraud detection. SVMs aim to find the hyperplane that separates the positive and negative examples maximally. The algorithm constructs a margin around the boundary that forces it to minimize errors, making it robust to noise and outliers. The kernel trick is used to project the original feature space onto a higher dimensional space where linear separation becomes possible.
