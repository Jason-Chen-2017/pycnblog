======================================================================================

In this chapter, we will delve into the practical applications of AI large models in the education sector, specifically focusing on intelligent tutoring and evaluation. We will explore the background, core concepts, algorithms, best practices, real-world scenarios, tools, resources, future trends, challenges, and frequently asked questions related to this topic.

Background and Introduction
-------------------------

* The rise of AI in education
* Benefits and limitations of AI in teaching and learning
* Overview of intelligent tutoring and evaluation

Core Concepts and Connections
-----------------------------

* Definition of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS)
* Personalized learning and adaptive instruction
* Formative and summative assessment
* Natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, and computer vision in ITS

Core Algorithms and Operational Steps
------------------------------------

### 9.3.1.1 Student Modeling

* Data collection and feature extraction
* Machine learning techniques for student modeling
	+ Rule-based approaches
	+ Bayesian networks
	+ Decision trees and random forests
	+ Neural networks and deep learning
* Model evaluation and refinement

### 9.3.1.2 Intelligent Tutoring

* Domain model and expert knowledge representation

### 9.3.1.3 Automated Evaluation

* Objective and subjective assessments
* Automatic scoring and rubrics
* Learner engagement and affect detection
* Plagiarism and academic dishonesty detection

Mathematical Models and Formulas
-------------------------------

* Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
* Information gain: IG(A;B) = H(A) - H(A|B)
* Confusion matrix for binary classification:

$$
\begin{array}{cc}
\text{True Positive (TP)} & \text{False Positive (FP)}\
\text{False Negative (FN)} & \text{True Negative (TN)}
\end{array}
$$

* Precision: P = TP / (TP + FP)
* Recall: R = TP / (TP + FN)
* F1 score: F1 = 2 \* (P \* R) / (P + R)

# Initialize the network, loss function, and optimizer
net = Net()
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.01, momentum=0.5)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(10):  # loop over the dataset multiple times
   running_loss = 0.0
   for i, data in enumerate(train_loader, 0):
       inputs, labels = data
       optimizer.zero_grad()
       outputs = net(inputs)
       loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
       loss.backward()
