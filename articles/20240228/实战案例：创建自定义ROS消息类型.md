## 背景介绍

Robot Operating System (ROS) 是一个多 slä `robotic`  robotics framework  enabling  software  developers  to  build  complex  and  robust  robotic applications. It provides a set of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.

At the core of ROS is its ability to allow different nodes to communicate with each other through a publish-subscribe model. This communication is facilitated by the use of messages, which are essentially data structures used to send information between nodes. By default, ROS comes with a predefined set of message types that cover common use cases. However, there may be situations where you need to create a custom message type to meet your specific application requirements.

In this article, we will explore how to create a custom ROS message type from scratch, using practical examples and clear explanations. We will also discuss some best practices and potential challenges when working with custom message types in RS.

## 核心概念与联系

ROS messages are a key component of the ROS ecosystem, allowing nodes to communicate and share information. At a high level, ROS messages are similar to structs or classes in programming languages like C++ or Python. They consist of named fields, each with a unique identifier and a data type. These fields can be of various basic types such as integers, floating point numbers, booleans, and strings, or they can be more complex types such as arrays, vectors, or even other messages.

When a node publishes a message, it sends it to a topic. Other nodes that have subscribed to that topic will receive the message and can process its contents. Each topic has a unique name within the ROS network, and multiple topics can have the same name as long as they are in different namespaces.

To create a custom message type, you need to define a new message file in the ROS message format. This file specifies the structure of the message, including its fields and their data types. Once the message file is created, you can compile it to generate code in your preferred programming language(s), which you can then use to create publisher and subscriber nodes for that message type.

### ROS message format

The ROS message format uses a simple syntax based on the XML schema language (XSD). A message file consists of a series of message definitions, each enclosed in `<message>` tags. Each definition includes a name, a list of fields, and optional metadata such as documentation or access control.

Here's an example of a simple message file defining a custom message type called `MyMessage`, which has two fields: an integer field called `count`, and a string field called `name`.
```lua
<message name="MyMessage">
  <field name="count" type="int32"/>
  <field name="name" type="string"/>
</message>
```
The name of the message file should end with the `.msg` extension, and should be placed in a directory corresponding to its package name. For example, if your package is called `my_package`, you would place the `MyMessage.msg` file in the `my_package/msg` directory.

### Message generation

Once you have defined your custom message type, you can generate code for it using the `catkin_generate_messages` tool. This tool reads the message files in your package and generates code in your chosen programming language(s) based on those definitions. The generated code includes functions for creating, parsing, and manipulating messages, as well as message classes that you can use to create publisher and subscriber nodes.

By default, `catkin_generate_messages` generates code for C++ and Python, but you can configure it to generate code for other languages as well. You can also specify additional options such as include directories, library dependencies, or compiler flags.

After generating the code, you need to build your package using `catkin_make` or another build system. This will compile the generated code into a library or executable that you can link against in your node programs.

## 核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解

Creating a custom ROS message type involves several steps:

1. Define the message structure by writing a message file in the ROS message format.
2. Generate code for the message using `catkin_generate_messages`.
3. Build your package using `catkin_make` or another build system.
4. Write node programs that use the custom message type.

We have already discussed the first three steps in the previous sections. In this section, we will focus on the fourth step: writing node programs that use the custom message type.

To create a publisher node for a custom message type, you typically follow these steps:

1. Import the generated message module in your node program.
2. Create a message object by instantiating the message class.
3. Set the values of the message fields.
4. Create a publisher object and specify the message type and topic.
5. Call the `publish()` method of the publisher object, passing the message object as an argument.

Here's an example of a publisher node program written in Python, using the `MyMessage` custom message type defined earlier.
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import rospy
from my_package.msg import MyMessage

def talker():
   pub = rospy.Publisher('my_topic', MyMessage, queue_size=10)
   rospy.init_node('talker', anonymous=True)
   rate = rospy.Rate(1)
   while not rospy.is_shutdown():
       msg = MyMessage()
       msg.count = 42
       msg.name = "Hello, world!"
       pub.publish(msg)
       rate.sleep()

if __name__ == '__main__':
   try:
       talker()
   except rospy.ROSInterruptException:
       pass
```
To create a subscriber node for a custom message type, you typically follow these steps:

1. Import the generated message module in your node program.
2. Create a callback function that processes incoming messages.
3. Create a subscriber object and specify the message type and topic.
4. Register the callback function with the subscriber object.
5. Start the node and wait for messages.

Here's an example of a subscriber node program written in Python, using the `MyMessage` custom message type defined earlier.
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import rospy
from my_package.msg import MyMessage

def callback(data):
   print("Received message: count=%d, name=%s" % (data.count, data.name))

def listener():
   rospy.init_node('listener', anonymous=True)
   rospy.Subscriber("my_topic", MyMessage, callback)
   rospy.spin()

if __name__ == '__main__':
   listener()
```
When you run both the publisher and subscriber nodes together, you should see the subscriber node print out the received messages as follows:
```less
Received message: count=42, name=Hello, world!
```
This demonstrates how to create and use a custom ROS message type in practice. By defining your own message types, you can encapsulate complex data structures and make them available to other nodes in your ROS network.

## 实际应用场景

Custom ROS message types are useful in many scenarios where the predefined message types do not provide enough flexibility or expressiveness. Here are some examples:

* Sensor data: If you are working with a custom sensor or data acquisition system, you may need to define a custom message type to represent the sensor data in a way that is meaningful and easy to process. For example, you might define a message type with fields for timestamp, position, orientation, and other relevant data.
* Robot control: If you are building a robot control application, you may need to define a custom message type to represent high-level commands or status information. For example, you might define a message type with fields for target position, velocity, acceleration, and other control parameters.
* Multi-robot systems: If you are working with a team of robots, you may need to define custom message types to coordinate their behavior and share information. For example, you might define a message type with fields for task assignments, group formations, or communication protocols.
* Machine learning: If you are using machine learning algorithms in your ROS application, you may need to define custom message types to represent input features, output labels, or training data. For example, you might define a message type with fields for image pixels, object detection bounding boxes, or classification scores.

By defining custom message types, you can tailor the communication protocols of your ROS application to your specific needs and requirements, making it more efficient, flexible, and scalable.
