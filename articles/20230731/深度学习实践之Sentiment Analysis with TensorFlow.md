# 1.简介
         

         Sentiment analysis (SA) is a natural language processing technique used to identify and extract subjective information from text data. SA has many applications in social media analytics, customer feedback analysis, market research, and opinion mining. 
         
         In this article, we will demonstrate how to use the TensorFlow library for building an effective sentiment analysis model on movie reviews dataset using a pre-trained deep learning model called BERT. We will also discuss various techniques of fine tuning and evaluating our sentiment analysis models.

         ## Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning
          
          NLP stands for Natural Language Processing which involves the use of computational algorithms to enable computers to understand human languages as they are spoken or written. It involves tasks such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, stemming/lemmatization, parsing, classification, translation, and named entity recognition. 
          
          The most popular deep learning frameworks include PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Caffe, etc. These libraries provide powerful tools for building complex neural networks that can learn complex relationships between input data and output labels. They have made significant progress towards enabling large-scale real-world applications like image and speech recognition, natural language understanding, and recommendation systems. 
          
        ## Movie Reviews Dataset
        
        Our sentiment analysis task is based on the IMDB movie review dataset, which consists of binary sentiment polarity labels (positive or negative) for highly polarizing reviews about movies. This dataset contains over 50,000 labeled movie reviews split evenly into training and testing sets. Each review is associated with a rating score from 1 to 10, where scores above 7 are considered positive while those below 4 are considered negative.
        
        
        ## Pre-Trained Model: BERT
        
        BERT, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a pre-trained transformer-based language model that is capable of extracting features useful for natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis. It was introduced by Google AI Language Team in late 2018 and achieved state-of-the-art results on a wide range of NLP tasks. Its architecture includes two main components - Transformer encoder and masked language model head. 
        
        Let's now break down each component in more detail.

        ### Transformer Encoder:
        
        The transformer encoder module is responsible for encoding input sequences of tokens into high-dimensional dense vectors called contextual representations. A transformer encoder is composed of multiple layers of attention blocks, which transform the input sequence at different positions into a set of queries, keys, values, and attentions. Attention allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input sequence depending on their relevance to the current position being processed. 

        ### Masked Language Model Head:

        The masked language model head predicts the probability distribution over all possible next words given a fixed length input sequence consisting of [MASK] tokens. The purpose of the MASK token is to train the model to predict the original word instead of any substituted word. The predictions from the masked language model head help the model to make better decisions when generating new sentences.

        ## Fine Tuning
        Fine-tuning refers to modifying pretrained models to fit your own problem domain or dataset. It involves fixing some of the weights of the network and training it on your own data. One common practice during transfer learning is to freeze certain layers of the base model and only train the top layers of the network. For example, if you want to classify images of animals, you might freeze the convolutional layers of a pre-trained CNN and only train the fully connected layer(s).
        
        During fine-tuning, we adjust the hyperparameters of the model, such as the learning rate, batch size, optimizer, and regularization techniques, according to the type of dataset and the complexity of the task. Hyperparameter tuning often requires experimentation and observation to find optimal settings.
        
        ## Evaluation Metrics
        
        There are several evaluation metrics commonly used in sentiment analysis tasks, including accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. Accuracy measures the percentage of correctly classified samples, while precision and recall measure the extent to which the model is able to detect true positives and true negatives respectively. An ideal classifier should be both precise and reliable, achieving high precision but low recall due to its limited capability to identify false positives.
        
        Moreover, there are other performance metrics such as ROCAUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under Curve), PRAUC (Precision Recall Area Under Curve), Confusion Matrix, Hamming Loss, Jaccard Similarity Index, and Cross Entropy loss that can further evaluate the quality of our sentiment analysis models.
