         在机器学习或深度学习领域中，目标函数通常是一个非凸函数。对于非凸函数而言，求解其局部最优解存在着困难。其中，梯度下降法(Gradient descent)方法是最常用的优化算法之一。本文将介绍梯度下降法的基本原理及其实现。
         
         在介绍算法前，首先需要了解几个重要概念，如：目标函数、损失函数、参数、迭代次数等。
          
          # 2. Basic concepts and terminologies

          ## Objective function or loss function:
          In machine learning or deep learning, an objective function is a non-convex function that maps from input variables to output values. It represents the optimization problem that we want to solve. The goal of training a model is to minimize the difference between the predicted outputs and the true outputs given some inputs. Therefore, the objective function is usually chosen as the loss function which measures the error between the predicted value and the target value. Examples of commonly used loss functions are mean squared error (MSE), cross-entropy loss, KL divergence loss, etc.

           To train our models, we need to find the optimal set of parameters that minimizes the objective function over a training dataset. This can be done using various optimization algorithms like gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, etc. 

          ## Parameters:
          We define the model's parameters as the variable that controls the behavior of the model. These parameters include weights, biases, scaling factors, thresholds, etc., depending on the type of model being trained. During training, we adjust these parameters such that the objective function is minimized. One way to optimize the parameters is by using techniques like gradient descent or SGD.

          ## Iteration or epochs:
          A single epoch refers to one pass through the entire training data. During each iteration, the model makes predictions on the training data and updates its parameters based on the gradients calculated for the corresponding objective function at those predictions. After multiple iterations, the model will have converged to a local minimum of the objective function. However, it may take many iterations before convergence if the initial starting point is not very close to the global minimum. There are several strategies to avoid getting stuck in a local minimum and improve the performance of the model, including early stopping, reducing the learning rate, using regularization techniques, etc.

          ## Batch size:
          A batch size refers to the number of samples processed in one forward and backward propagation pass during training. For large datasets, we typically use smaller batches to speed up computation time while still maintaining good generalization performance.

          ## Learning rate:
          The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls how much we update the parameters at each iteration. If the learning rate is too high, the model might jump across the valley instead of converging to the minimum. Similarly, if the learning rate is too low, the model may not make progress towards the minimum. We can control the learning rate using various scheduling policies like exponential decay, stepwise decrease, etc.

          ## Regularization:
          Regularization techniques try to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the objective function that forces the model to learn simpler and less complex relationships between the input and output variables. Common regularization techniques include L1/L2 regularization, dropout, weight constraints, maxnorm regularization, etc.

          ## Loss curve and validation set:
          A useful tool for monitoring the performance of the model is to plot the loss vs. epoch graph and also evaluate the model on a separate validation set after every few epochs. The loss should decrease monotonically with increasing epochs until reaching a plateau, indicating that the model has converged. If the validation loss starts to increase again after the first plateau, then there is something wrong with the model and further tuning would likely be needed.

         # 3. Algorithm

          The basic idea behind gradient descent is to repeatedly modify the parameters in the direction opposite to their current gradient to reduce the objective function. At each iteration, we compute the gradient of the objective function with respect to the parameters, and then move in the negative gradient direction proportional to the learning rate parameter $\alpha$. 

          1. Initialize the parameters randomly or using a pre-trained model.
           
          2. Repeat for $k$ epochs or until convergence {
             
             Calculate the gradient $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial w}$ and $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial b}$.
           
             Update the parameters by subtracting the product of the learning rate $\alpha$, the gradient with respect to the parameters and a momentum factor $\beta$:
             
              $$w := w - \alpha \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial w} -\beta m_w$$
              
              $$b := b - \alpha \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial b} -\beta m_b$$
              
             where $m_{w},m_{b}$ are previous steps' gradients multiplied by a factor $\beta$.

            }
         
         The above algorithm is equivalent to computing the gradient of the objective function at the current parameter settings, moving in the negative direction of this gradient, and updating the parameters according to the specified learning rate and momentum.

         ## Implementation details

         ### Step size control
         
         In practice, we often choose different step sizes for the parameters along each dimension based on empirical evidence about the curvature of the objective function. Some popular choices for controlling the step size are:

         * Constant step size ($\alpha=c$)

         * Decaying step size ($\alpha=\alpha_0 e^{-kt}$, where $\alpha_0$ is the initial step size and $t$ is the current iteration or epoch)

         * Adaptive step size (using line search methods to find the best step size for each iteration)

         ### Momentum
         
         Inspired by physical systems, we introduce a momentum term $\beta$ that captures the frictional force exerted on the system by past gradients. Specifically, we maintain two accumulators for the last two steps' gradients and multiply them together when updating the parameters:

         $$\beta m_w := \beta m_w + (1-\beta) (\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial w})$$
        
         $$\beta m_b := \beta m_b + (1-\beta) (\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial b})$$

         $$    heta :=     heta - \alpha [\beta m_w + (1-\beta) (\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial w}), \beta m_b + (1-\beta) (\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial b})]$$

         By combining both the constant step size and adaptive step size approaches, we get the following hybrid strategy called Adagrad:

         ### Adagrad

         $$E[g^2]_t = E[g^2]_{t-1} + g^2_t$$

         $$H = diag(\sqrt{E[g^2]_{i}})$$

         $$\alpha_t = \frac{r}{\sqrt{H}}$$

         $$    heta :=     heta - \alpha_t [\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_i}{\partial w_j}^T H_j,\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_i}{\partial b_j}^T H_j ]$$

         Here, $H$ is the diagonal matrix containing the square roots of the summed squares of recent gradients, while $E[g^2]$ is the vector consisting of running averages of the second moments of the gradients. The step size $\alpha_t$ is determined by the ratio of the learning rate $r$ to the root of the element-wise sum of the historical second moment estimates and the gradient itself.

         ### Adam

          Adam stands for "adaptive moment estimation". It combines ideas from AdaGrad and RMSProp. It maintains two momentum accumulators $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ and uses bias correction terms $\hat{m}_w^{(t)},\hat{m}_b^{(t)}$ to estimate the true mean and variance of the gradient over time. The updated rule for updating the parameters is as follows:

          $$\hat{m}^{(t+1)}_w := \frac{m_w}{1-\beta_1^t}$$
          
          $$\hat{m}^{(t+1)}_b := \frac{m_b}{1-\beta_1^t}$$

          $$E[g^2]^{(t+1)} := \beta_2 E[g^2]^{(t)} + (1-\beta_2)\frac{G^2}{2}$$

          $$V^{(    heta)}_{\pi_    heta}(t) := \alpha\sqrt{\frac{2}{V^{\phi}_{\pi_    heta}(t-1)}}$$

          $$\epsilon_t := \frac{V^{\phi}_{\pi_    heta}(t-1)+\epsilon_{    ext{min}}}{\sqrt{t}}$

          $$    heta :=     heta - V^{(    heta)}_{\pi_    heta}(    heta)(\hat{m}^{(t+1)}+\epsilon_t\hat{v}^{(t)})$$

          Here, $\beta_1$ is the exponentially weighted average coefficient for the first order moment, $\beta_2$ is the exponentially weighted average coefficient for the second order moment, and $\epsilon_{    ext{min}}$ is a small positive constant to avoid division by zero. Finally, $\epsilon_t$ is added for numerical stability.
