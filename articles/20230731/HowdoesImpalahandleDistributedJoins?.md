           ### Abstract:Apache Impala is an open-source MPP (Massively Parallel Processing) SQL engine designed for handling large datasets efficiently. In this article, we will discuss the design choices made by Impala team while implementing the Distributed JOIN operation to support parallel processing. We will also explain the architecture and core algorithm of the Distributed SQL engine and highlight the challenges faced during its implementation. The main focus of this article will be on discussing the code and underlying algorithms.
        
        
         # Introduction 
         As part of Apache Hive's development, Apache Spark was launched which was based on MapReduce programming model and its scalability, high performance capabilities were seen as a great advantage over traditional Hadoop ecosystem. After some time however, Hadoop users continued finding their limitations with respect to processing complex queries that involve large datasets. To address these issues, Apache Impala was introduced which provides massive parallel processing capabilities and integrates well with various data sources such as HDFS, Cassandra, Kafka etc.
       
         This article discusses one of the critical components in Apache Impala i.e., Handling of Distributed JOIN operation which is essential for executing complex queries involving multiple tables or partitions.
        
       # Problem statement 
          Analysing data from different tables can often require joining them together to form meaningful insights. A typical scenario would be to retrieve data related to customers who have placed orders in a certain period of time, across multiple tables. 
       
          However, performing complex joins on large datasets has been challenging because most traditional database management systems do not scale horizontally – meaning they cannot distribute the load across several servers without adding complexity to query execution plans. This makes it difficult to execute join operations quickly and effectively. 

          There are several approaches available to perform joins in a distributed environment, but the key challenge is to ensure efficient communication between nodes and avoid redundant workloads. One common approach is to use broadcast joins wherein all required tables are loaded into every node’s memory before starting any computation. Another approach is to partition the data based on keys and parallelize the join operation within each partition. These techniques typically improve performance but may still lead to bottlenecks when dealing with skewed data or excessive fan-out due to small table sizes.

          Apache Impala uses the concept of dynamic fragment pruning to minimize the amount of data transferred and processed at each node. Dynamic fragment pruning ensures that only necessary fragments are loaded on each node and avoids unnecessary network traffic and CPU overhead. It also allows for optimized scheduling of individual tasks within each partition to achieve even better performance.

         # Solution Approach

           Let us now understand how Apache Impala implements the Distributed Join operation. Firstly, let’s review the overall architecture of the distributed SQL engine process on the client side and server side.

           Client Side Process
           
           Impala’s client processes communicate with the MetaStore service, which maintains metadata information about all the tables and databases being accessed. Once the user submits a query, the parser module breaks down the submitted query into logical operators and sends them to the compiler module. Compiler generates physical plan by identifying the best ways to execute the given query, including optimizer decisions such as reordering of operators for more efficient processing.

           Server Side Process
           
           Apache Impala leverages both Hadoop’s Distributed File System (HDFS) and DataNode services to store and manage data files. Each DataNode acts as a separate storage unit for managing its own set of data blocks. Impala’s executors run inside DataNodes and help process the incoming requests. When an executor receives a request for data processing, it first checks whether the required data is already cached locally. If yes, then the data is immediately sent back to the requesting executor. Otherwise, the requested data block is fetched from remote data nodes.

       # Limitations
           Apache Impala is still a young project and there are many challenges yet to face. Some of the major ones include:

           1. Performance impact caused by excessive resource utilization: Since impala is heavily dependent on disk I/O, heavy usage can cause system instability leading to slow response times or even cluster crashes.
            
           2. Scalability problems: Although impala manages to scale horizontally by sharding data and distributing resources amongst multiple nodes, it hasn't been tested extensively to find its limits.
            
           3. Complexity in scaling up and out: Scaling impala clusters involves updating configuration files, restarting services, increasing hardware resources and adding new nodes to the cluster. Despite these efforts, impala remains limited in terms of its ability to scale beyond a single machine.
            
           4. Complex joins causing significant bottleneck: Depending upon the size and complexity of tables involved in joins, impala may struggle to optimize the query execution plan and end up creating too many splits which leads to low performance.
