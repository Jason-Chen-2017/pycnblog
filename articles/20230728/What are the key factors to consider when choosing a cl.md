 Cloud computing is one of the most popular and hottest technologies today. The rise in popularity of this new technology has resulted in organizations adopting various cloud platforms for their applications. In this article, we will discuss some basic concepts related to cloud computing along with some key factors to choose from different cloud platforms. We'll also explain how these factors impact the choice of cloud platform that can help us decide on our future project.
         # 2.Cloud Computing Basic Concepts and Terminologies
         ## 2.1 Introduction to Cloud Computing
         Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet through the use of remote servers hosted by third-party providers. It allows users to access storage, processing power, databases, networking capabilities, and other resources as needed over the internet. This type of computing service provides scalability, flexibility, cost effectiveness, high availability, security, and reliability.

         There are several types of cloud computing services such as public, private, hybrid, and community clouds which offer different levels of abstraction, functionality, and control. Each provider brings its own set of unique features and benefits but they all share similar core principles of automation, elasticity, pay-as-you-go pricing, and service level agreements (SLAs).

         Before discussing specific cloud platforms or services, it's essential to have an understanding of fundamental cloud computing terminology. These terms include virtualization, containerization, hypervisor, IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, FaaS, serverless architecture, and cloud agnosticism.

         Virtualization involves the creation of a virtual environment within a physical machine. Containers provide a lightweight operating system layer that shares the kernel with other containers running on the same host system. Hypervisors act as intermediaries between virtual machines and hosts, enabling them to run isolated environments without sacrificing hardware performance.

         IaaS stands for Infrastructure as a Service, where vendors offer cloud infrastructure products like compute, network, and storage resources that are designed to be provisioned and managed using software tools like APIs. Examples of IaaS companies include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine, Rackspace, IBM SoftLayer, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, and Aliyun.

         PaaS stands for Platform as a Service, where developers can deploy applications without having to worry about managing underlying servers, virtualization layers, or operating systems. Developers simply upload their code to a hosting provider’s PaaS service and the platform handles everything else such as scaling, load balancing, and monitoring. Popular examples of PaaS services include Heroku, Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and IBM Bluemix.

         SaaS stands for Software as a Service, where businesses sell prepackaged software solutions that can be hosted and used by customers online. Examples of SaaS companies include Salesforce, Box, GitHub, Workday, and Dropbox.

         FaaS stands for Function-as-a-Service, where developers can deploy functions that can be executed on demand without needing to manage any underlying servers or runtime environments. Serverless architectures enable developers to build highly available, fault-tolerant applications without thinking about servers at all. They abstract away the complexity of provisioning, managing, and scaling infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on writing business logic instead. Popular serverless platforms include AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions, and IBM OpenWhisk.

         Agnosticism refers to the ability of cloud computing platforms to work across multiple cloud providers and support diverse programming languages and frameworks. By eliminating vendor lock-in, organizations can leverage the best of breed cloud services while still staying independent of specific providers.

         ## 2.2 Choosing a Cloud Platform: Key Factors to Consider
         When selecting a cloud platform, there are several factors to consider such as price, performance, scalability, durability, and support. Let's look at each factor in detail.

         1. Price: As mentioned earlier, cloud computing offers flexible pricing structures based on usage, consumption, or reservations. However, not every organization can afford to spend large amounts on cloud services due to financial constraints. Therefore, it's crucial to carefully compare prices offered by different cloud platforms before making a final decision. Additionally, make sure you understand pricing models including pay-per-use, per-second billing, and commitment-based contracts.

           On the other hand, if you're an individual user who wants to save money, you might want to consider other options like dedicated servers or virtual machines provided by traditional IT departments.

         2. Performance: Another important aspect of cloud computing is the speed and efficiency of services. Higher end cloud platforms promise faster response times and lower latency than local deployments. However, keep in mind that slower performance could lead to decreased overall user experience. To ensure optimal performance, it's advisable to monitor resource utilization and adjust configurations accordingly.

         3. Scalability: Scalability refers to the ability of a system to handle increased workload or capacity without significant downtime. While it may seem counterintuitive, increasing the number of instances or nodes in a cluster should increase the throughput and reduce response time.

           It's worth mentioning that scalability is not always straightforward since certain cloud platforms limit the maximum size of clusters or deployments. Even so, the more critical factor for scalability is ensuring robustness and reliability of deployed applications. If an application fails unexpectedly, automatic failover mechanisms must be implemented to ensure continued business operations.

         4. Durability: Cloud platforms are generally resistant to failures and disruptions due to natural causes such as climate change or infrastructure failures. However, if an unforeseen event occurs outside of the control of the organization, data loss can occur. For example, if a data center goes offline, backups may need to be taken prior to restoring the database.

         5. Support: Last but not least, cloud platforms come equipped with excellent customer support teams who respond quickly to issues and provide prompt resolutions. Despite the fact that there are many different cloud platforms around, there is no single universal support structure or SLAs. Therefore, it's essential to select a platform with a reputable company backing its support team.

         Based on these five factors, organizations can determine the right cloud platform that fits their needs, budget, and objectives. Selecting a cloud platform early in the development process can greatly improve productivity and cut down costs compared to building and maintaining infrastructure on-premises.
