 Rust is a high-performance systems programming language and has been gaining immense popularity among developers for its safety features, compile time speed, memory usage efficiency, and cross platform support compared to other languages like C++ or Java. In this blog post, we will explore the ownership model of Rust, which allows it to better manage resources and improve performance in certain scenarios. The ownership model is also used by many popular web frameworks such as Actix Web and Tide to handle HTTP requests efficiently. To understand more about the benefits of using ownership model and how it works, let's dive into the topic step by step:

          **Note**: This article assumes that you have some basic knowledge of Rust syntax, concepts, and functional programming paradigm.

         # 2.Ownership Model in Rust
         ## 2.1 Basics of Ownership
         Let's start by understanding what "ownership" means in Rust. In Rust, every value (number, string, array, struct, function) has an owner who determines when the value is dropped and can access it. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is automatically dropped and any resource associated with it is freed up.

         For example, consider the following program:
```rust
fn main() {
    let x = String::from("Hello World"); // created on stack
    
    println!("{}", x);

    drop(x); // drops the variable from stack because it is no longer needed
}
``` 

In the above code snippet, `String` type creates a new object called `"Hello World"` on the stack. Since there are references pointing to the value at this point, it cannot be dropped until those references go out of scope. However, once they do, the object gets dropped since it is not referenced anymore. Once the owner (`main()` function here) moves out of scope, it takes over the ownership of the value and lets Rust free the allocated memory. We call this transfer of ownership.

        Now let's talk about values vs references in Rust. A reference (&T) refers to an owned value of type T whereas a value (T) owns the data directly and ensures that the data is properly cleaned up. In simpler terms, a reference gives temporary read/write access to the owned value while a value provides exclusive access during its lifetime.
        Consider the following example:

```rust
fn add_one(num: &mut i32) {
   *num += 1;
}

fn print_num(num: i32) {
    println!("Number is {}", num);
}

fn main() {
    let mut number = 5;

    print_num(number);   // prints "Number is 5"

    add_one(&mut number); // increments the number by one through reference

    print_num(number);   // still prints "Number is 5", only now number contains 6
}
```
Here, both `add_one()` and `print_num()` take either a mutable reference or immutable reference respectively depending on their need. Note that in the case of `add_one()`, we don't need to dereference the pointer (*) operator before accessing the actual value, instead, we simply use the shorthand notation `*`. By taking a mutable reference, we can modify the original value indirectly without needing to copy it first. Finally, note that passing around immutable references to functions is cheap and efficient due to borrow checking rules in Rust.
        
        So why should we care about ownership? Well, managing resources correctly is important to prevent memory leaks and ensure safe concurrent execution. In addition, using the ownership model simplifies the design of complex software systems since it makes sure objects are always valid and accessible only within the scope of the current function or thread. Additionally, by default, Rust enforces strict ownership rules and prevents common errors such as unintentional copies.

        Conclusion: Ownership is a fundamental concept in Rust and plays a crucial role in managing resources effectively. It ensures that resources are deallocated exactly when they become obsolete, reduces complexity of concurrency issues, improves performance, and helps avoid bugs related to resource management.
