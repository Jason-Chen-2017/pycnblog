Microservices architecture design patterns are a set of principles and practices for building distributed applications with the microservice architectural style. The Microservices architecture is considered to be an approach to software development where large monolithic applications are decomposed into smaller services that communicate with each other via well-defined APIs. This pattern provides several benefits such as better scalability, resilience, modularity, flexibility, and agility in developing complex systems.
The main aim of this article is to share best practices, ideas, and techniques to help developers design and build effective microservices architectures. In addition, we will discuss some popular technologies used in microservices architectures like API gateways, service meshes, containers, and cloud platforms. 

# 2.核心知识点
## 2.1微服务架构
Microservices architecture refers to a type of software architecture in which application or system functionality is broken down into small independent services running on their own process and communicating with each other using lightweight protocols over a network. Each microservice has its own database, language runtime, and configuration files, making it easy to scale horizontally or vertically based on demand without affecting the rest of the system. These services can also be deployed independently enabling them to be updated, scaled out, and replaced as needed. There are various approaches and design patterns available for implementing microservices architecture, including:

1. Standalone application - Single module/application composed of multiple microservices

2. Service-oriented architecture (SOA) - Collection of loosely coupled services built around business capabilities

3. Event-driven architecture - Centralized event bus connects all microservices

4. Distributed monolithic architecture - Large monolithic application split into smaller services through integration layers

5. Containerization - Microservices packaged as Docker containers

6. Cloud platform - Platforms like Kubernetes provide tools for managing and scaling microservices clusters

## 2.2设计原则
There are several key principles to consider when designing a microservices architecture: 

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: A single microservice should have only one purpose. If it does more than one thing, then it becomes too large and difficult to manage. 

2. **Service Registry**: It's important to maintain a central registry of all microservices so they can find and communicate with each other. The service registry ensures that every service knows about all other services in the cluster, how to reach them, and what they offer.

3. **API Gateway**: An API gateway acts as a front door to the microservices cluster by handling incoming requests from clients and routing them to appropriate backend services. It receives client requests, validates them against access control policies, transforms them according to requirements, caches responses, and passes them onto downstream services. It also serves as a single point of entry for monitoring, logging, and security functions.

4. **Service Discovery**: Microservices need to discover each other dynamically during runtime. The service discovery mechanism allows individual services to locate the right instances of another service. This helps in achieving higher availability and load balancing across different instances of a service.

5. **Database per service**: Each microservice should use its own database for data storage purposes. This enables easier horizontal scaling and isolation between services.

6. **Message Queue Integration**: Microservices communicate asynchronously using message queues instead of synchronous communication. Message queue brokers enable asynchronous messaging between microservices and support features like queuing, buffering, delivery retries, etc.

7. **Asynchronous Communication**: Microservices communicate asynchronously by sending messages to the message queue and acknowledging successful receipt before processing the request further. This reduces response time and improves throughput since there may be many concurrent requests coming in.

8. **Concurrency**: Microservices run independently of each other and can be scaled up or down depending on the traffic volume. They do not depend on shared resources or global state. As a result, concurrency can be managed at the code level rather than relying on infrastructure level solutions.

9. **Chaos Engineering**: Chaos engineering involves deliberately introducing failures or disruptions to verify the reliability, stability, and fault tolerance of a system under different types of stressors. It helps identify potential risks early in the lifecycle of an application and ensure that failure modes are contained.

10. **Event Sourcing Pattern**: Event sourcing pattern captures all changes to data as events that are stored sequentially in an append-only log called the event stream. Each change to the data generates a new event, which is simply a description of what changed and who did it. Services can rebuild their state by replaying these events. Events make it easier to track and debug changes to the data, especially when things go wrong.

11. **CQRS Pattern**: CQRS pattern separates read and write operations for a given microservice. Read operation microservices retrieve data from a repository while write operation microservices update data in the same repository but in a separate transactional manner. This separation makes it easier to scale reads separately from writes.

## 2.3设计方法
There are several ways to implement microservices architecture:

1. **Functional decomposition**: Decompose the whole system into small, independent functional modules or components that perform specific tasks, each responsible for a part of the overall functionality. Each component communicates with other components via interfaces.

2. **Domain Driven Design**: Domain driven design is an iterative approach to software design that focuses on modeling core domain concepts and interactions between those concepts. It encourages the creation of ubiquitous language that defines business entities and their relationships, ensuring that both technical and non-technical stakeholders understand the problem domain.

3. **Bounded Context**: Bounded context is an essential concept in domain driven design that breaks down a system into subdomains or contexts. Each subdomain is responsible for a particular area of functionality within the system. By breaking down the system into bounded contexts, teams can work more efficiently and effectively towards creating a consistent and coherent user experience.

4. **Event Storming**: Event storming is an exploratory technique used to model business domains and create candidate microservices. It involves team collaboration, brainstorming sessions, decision points, and analysis of prototypical scenarios to uncover high-level insights and generate candidate microservices.

5. **CQRS and Event Sourcing**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is a pattern used to partition a microservice into two parts - commands and queries. Commands handle updates to data whereas queries retrieve information from the database. Both operations follow strict consistency constraints and may take longer to complete compared to traditional CRUD operations. Additionally, event sourcing uses an append-only store to record every change to the data along with metadata associated with the change. It supports the replayability of actions taken on the data later.
