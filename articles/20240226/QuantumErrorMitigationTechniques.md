## 1. 背景介绍

### 1.1 Quantum Computing quantum computing

Quantum computing is a new type of computation that uses quantum mechanics to perform operations on data. Unlike classical computers, which use bits to represent information, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, thanks to a property called superposition, and can be entangled with each other, allowing them to affect each other even when separated by large distances. These properties enable quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers.

### 1.2 Quantum Error Correction quantum error correction

However, quantum systems are highly susceptible to errors due to environmental noise and imperfections in the hardware. This makes it challenging to build practical quantum computers. To address this issue, researchers have developed quantum error correction techniques that use redundant encoding of information to detect and correct errors. While these techniques have been successful in small-scale quantum systems, they become increasingly complex and resource-intensive as the number of qubits grows.

### 1.3 Quantum Error Mitigation quantum error mitigation

Quantum error mitigation (QEM) is a set of techniques that aim to reduce the impact of errors in quantum computations without requiring full quantum error correction. QEM techniques focus on reducing the probability of errors occurring or mitigating their effects after they occur. By using QEM techniques, researchers hope to achieve practical quantum computations in the near term while working towards developing more advanced quantum error correction methods.

## 2. 核心概念与关系

### 2.1 Quantum Error Mitigation vs Quantum Error Correction

Quantum error correction (QEC) involves encoding information in a way that allows for detection and correction of errors. QEC requires redundancy and overhead, making it resource-intensive and difficult to scale up. In contrast, QEM techniques aim to reduce the impact of errors without requiring full error correction. QEM techniques can be used in combination with QEC to further improve the reliability of quantum computations.

### 2.2 Types of Errors

There are two main types of errors in quantum computing: coherent errors and incoherent errors. Coherent errors result from systematic errors in the quantum hardware, such as imperfect control pulses or magnetic field fluctuations. Incoherent errors arise from random processes, such as thermal noise or interactions with the environment. Different QEM techniques may be better suited for addressing different types of errors.

### 2.3 Error Propagation

Errors in quantum computations can propagate and accumulate over time, leading to significant errors in the final result. Understanding how errors propagate is essential for designing effective QEM techniques. Techniques such as error mitigation through symmetry verification and probabilistic error cancellation aim to prevent or correct errors before they can propagate.

### 3.1 Error Mitigation through Symmetry Verification

Error mitigation through symmetry verification involves exploiting symmetries in the quantum circuit to detect and correct errors. The basic idea is to introduce a symmetry operator into the circuit and then measure the expectation value of the operator at the end of the computation. If the measured value is not equal to the expected value, an error has occurred. By repeating the computation with different symmetry operators, errors can be detected and corrected.

The mathematical model for error mitigation through symmetry verification involves defining a symmetry operator S and then measuring the expectation value of S after the computation. The expectation value is given by:

$$E(S) = \frac{1}{N}\sum\_{i=1}^N \< \psi\_i | S | \psi\_i \>$$

where N is the number of measurements and $|\psi\_i\>$ is the state of the system after the i-th measurement.

### 3.2 Probabilistic Error Cancellation

Probabilistic error cancellation involves introducing ancilla qubits and performing measurements to determine the probability of errors occurring. The basic idea is to measure the probability distribution of the errors and then use this information to correct the errors. Probabilistic error cancellation can be combined with other QEM techniques, such as zero-noise extrapolation, to further improve the accuracy of quantum computations.

The mathematical model for probabilistic error cancellation involves defining a set of error operators E\_i and their associated probabilities p\_i. The corrected expectation value is given by:

$$\<A\>\_c = \sum\_{i} p\_i \<E\_i^\dagger A E\_i\>$$

where A is the observable being measured.

### 3.3 Zero-Noise Extrapolation

Zero-noise extrapolation involves simulating the quantum circuit at different levels of noise and then extrapolating to the zero-noise limit. The basic idea is to estimate the error due to noise and then remove it by extrapolating to the ideal zero-noise case. Zero-noise extrapolation can be combined with other QEM techniques, such as Richardson extrapolation, to further improve the accuracy of quantum computations.

The mathematical model for zero-noise extrapolation involves defining a noise scaling factor $\alpha$ and then measuring the expectation value of the observable at different values of $\alpha$. The corrected expectation value is given by:

$$\<A\>\_c = \<A(\alpha=0)\> + \sum\_{i} c\_i \alpha^i$$

where $c\_i$ are coefficients determined by fitting the data to a polynomial function of $\alpha$.

### 4.1 Error Mitigation through Symmetry Verification Example

Here is an example of error mitigation through symmetry verification using Qiskit:
```python
import numpy as np
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile, assemble, Aer, execute

# Define the quantum circuit
circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)
circuit.h(0)
circuit.cx(0, 1)
circuit.h(1)
circuit.measure_all()

# Define the symmetry operator
s = CircuitSymmetry(circuit, [(0, 'H'), (1, 'H')])

# Define the number of shots
shots = 1000

# Run the circuit and measure the expectation value of the symmetry operator
for _ in range(10):
   job = execute(transpile(circuit, backend=Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')), backend=Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator'), shots=shots)
   counts = job.result().get_counts()
   expval_s = s.expectation_value(counts) / shots
   print("Expectation value of S: {:.2f}".format(expval_s))
```
This example defines a simple quantum circuit that creates a Bell state and measures the two qubits. The symmetry operator S is defined using the `CircuitSymmetry` class from Qiskit, which automatically identifies the symmetry in the circuit. The number of shots is set to 1000, and the circuit is run ten times to obtain the expectation value of the symmetry operator.

### 4.2 Probabilistic Error Cancellation Example

Here is an example of probabilistic error cancellation using Qiskit:
```python
import numpy as np
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile, assemble, Aer, execute
from qiskit.ignis.mitigation.measurement import MeasurementFilter

# Define the quantum circuit
circuit = QuantumCircuit(1)
circuit.h(0)
circuit.measure_all()

# Define the error operators and their associated probabilities
error_operators = [np.eye(2), np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]])]
probabilities = [0.9, 0.1]

# Create the measurement filter
filter_op = MeasurementFilter(error_operators, probabilities)

# Define the number of shots
shots = 1000

# Run the circuit and apply the measurement filter
job = execute(transpile(circuit, backend=Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')), backend=Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator'), shots=shots)
counts = job.result().get_counts()
filtered_counts = filter_op.apply(counts)

# Calculate the probability of each outcome
probs = np.array([filtered_counts[k]/shots for k in filtered_counts])
print("Probability of |0>: {:.2f}".format(probs[0]))
print("Probability of |1>: {:.2f}".format(probs[1]))
```
This example defines a simple quantum circuit that applies an Hadamard gate to one qubit and measures it. The error operators and their associated probabilities are defined explicitly. The measurement filter is created using the `MeasurementFilter` class from Qiskit, and the circuit is run with 1000 shots. The `apply` method of the measurement filter is used to correct the measured counts, and the probabilities of the outcomes are calculated.

### 4.3 Zero-Noise Extrapolation Example

Here is an example of zero-noise extrapolation using Qiskit:
```python
import numpy as np
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile, assemble, Aer, execute
from qiskit.ignis.mitigation.extrapolation import CihedralExtrapolator

# Define the quantum circuit
circuit = QuantumCircuit(1)
circuit.h(0)
circuit.measure_all()

# Define the noise scaling factors
noise_factors = np.array([0.5, 1.0, 2.0])

# Define the number of shots
shots = 1000

# Run the circuit at different noise levels and calculate the expectation values
expvals = []
for alpha in noise_factors:
   circ = circuit.repeat(int(alpha*shots))
   job = execute(transpile(circ, backend=Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')), backend=Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator'), shots=1)
   counts = job.result().get_counts()
   expval = counts['1']/shots
   expvals.append(expval)

# Perform zero-noise extrapolation
extrap = CihedralExtrapolator(expvals, noise_factors)
expval_c = extrap.extrapolate()

# Print the corrected expectation value
print("Corrected expectation value: {:.2f}".format(expval_c))
```
This example defines a simple quantum circuit that applies an Hadamard gate to one qubit and measures it. The noise scaling factors are defined explicitly. The circuit is run at different noise levels by repeating the circuit multiple times, and the expectation values are calculated. Zero-noise extrapolation is performed using the `CihedralExtrapolator` class from Qiskit, and the corrected expectation value is printed.
