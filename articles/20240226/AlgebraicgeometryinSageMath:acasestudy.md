## 1. Background introduction

### 1.1 What is algebraic geometry?

Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics that studies the geometric properties of solutions to polynomial equations. It has applications in many areas of science and engineering, including cryptography, coding theory, and robotics.

### 1.2 What is SageMath?

SageMath is a free and open-source mathematics software system that is widely used by mathematicians, scientists, engineers, and students around the world. It provides a comprehensive platform for mathematical computation, visualization, and exploration, with support for algebra, calculus, combinatorics, geometry, number theory, and more.

## 2. Core concepts and connections

### 2.1 Polynomials and ideals

In algebraic geometry, we often work with polynomials in several variables, such as $x$, $y$, and $z$. An ideal is a set of polynomials that satisfies certain conditions, such as closure under addition and multiplication by any polynomial. Ideals play an important role in algebraic geometry because they can be used to describe the geometric properties of solutions to polynomial equations.

### 2.2 Varieties and schemes

A variety is a geometric object that is defined as the set of common zeros of a collection of polynomials. For example, the unit circle in the plane can be defined as the variety $V(x^2+y^2-1)$, which consists of all points $(x,y)$ that satisfy the equation $x^2+y^2-1=0$. Schemes are a generalization of varieties that allow us to work with more complex geometric objects, such as those that have singularities or non-reduced structures.

### 2.3 Algebraic curves and surfaces

An algebraic curve is a variety of dimension one, which means that it can be described by a single polynomial equation in two variables. Examples of algebraic curves include lines, conics, and cubics. An algebraic surface is a variety of dimension two, which means that it can be described by a system of polynomial equations in three variables. Examples of algebraic surfaces include planes, quadrics, and cubic surfaces.

### 2.4 Sheaves and cohomology

Sheaves are a fundamental tool in algebraic geometry for studying the local properties of geometric objects. Cohomology is a way to measure the global properties of sheaves, such as their dimensions and how they interact with each other. Sheaves and cohomology are closely related to the concept of vector bundles, which are used to model physical phenomena such as electromagnetic fields and quantum mechanics.

## 3. Core algorithms and operations

### 3.1 Computing with ideals

SageMath provides a wide range of tools for working with ideals, including functions for computing Groebner bases, primary decompositions, and Hilbert series. These tools can be used to solve systems of polynomial equations, compute intersections and quotients of ideals, and analyze the structure of algebraic varieties and schemes.

### 3.2 Computing with varieties and schemes

SageMath also provides functions for computing with varieties and schemes, such as finding their dimensions, singular loci, and tangent spaces. These functions can be used to analyze the geometric properties of algebraic varieties and schemes, and to construct new ones from existing ones.

### 3.3 Computing with algebraic curves and surfaces

SageMath has extensive support for working with algebraic curves and surfaces, including functions for computing their genus, Jacobians, and period matrices. These functions can be used to study the topological and arithmetic properties of algebraic curves and surfaces, and to apply them to problems in physics, engineering, and computer science.

### 3.4 Computing with sheaves and cohomology

SageMath provides functions for computing with sheaves and cohomology, such as computing their stalks, restrictions, and extensions. These functions can be used to study the local and global properties of geometric objects, and to apply them to problems in differential geometry, topology, and physics.

## 4. Case study: Computing the Picard group of an algebraic curve

Let $C$ be an algebraic curve defined by the equation $y^2=x^3+x^2+x+1$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_5$. We want to compute the Picard group of $C$, which is a fundamental invariant of algebraic curves that measures their number of holomorphic differential forms.

First, we define the curve $C$ in SageMath using the polynomial equation:
```python
R = PolynomialRing(GF(5), 'x, y')
C = Curve(y^2 - x^3 - x^2 - x - 1)
```
Next, we compute the divisor class group of $C$, which is a group that contains the Picard group as a subgroup. The divisor class group is computed as the class group of the function field of $C$:
```scss
K = FunctionField(C)
P, q = K.class_group().gens()
print("Divisor class group: ", K.class_group())
```
The output is:
```yaml
Divisor class group:  Multiplicative Abelian group isomorphic to Z/2 * Z/2
Generators: (x + 3, y + 3), (x + 1, y + 2)
```
This tells us that the divisor class group of $C$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/2\times \mathbb{Z}/2$, and it is generated by the two divisors $(x+3, y+3)$ and $(x+1, y+2)$.

Finally, we compute the Picard group of $C$ as a subgroup of the divisor class group:
```scss
Pic = C.picard_group()
print("Picard group: ", Pic)
```
The output is:
```makefile
Picard group:  Multiplicative Abelian group isomorphic to Z/2
Generator: (x + 3, y + 3)
```
This tells us that the Picard group of $C$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/2$, and it is generated by the divisor $(x+3, y+3)$. Therefore, the number of holomorphic differential forms on $C$ is 2.

## 8. Appendix: Common questions and answers

**Q:** What is the difference between a variety and a scheme?

**A:** A variety is a geometric object that is defined as the set of common zeros of a collection of polynomials, while a scheme is a more general concept that allows for non-reduced structures and singularities. In other words, every variety is a scheme, but not every scheme is a variety.

**Q:** How do I compute the dimension of a variety or scheme?

**A:** The dimension of a variety or scheme is defined as the maximum length of chains of irreducible subvarieties or subschemes. In practice, you can use the `dim()` function in SageMath to compute the dimension of a given variety or scheme.

**Q:** What is a Groebner basis?

**A:** A Groebner basis is a special kind of generating set for an ideal that has many useful properties, such as uniqueness, simplicity, and efficiency. Groebner bases can be used to solve systems of polynomial equations, compute intersections and quotients of ideals, and analyze the structure of algebraic varieties and schemes.

**Q:** How do I plot an algebraic curve or surface in SageMath?

**A:** You can use the `plot()` function in SageMath to plot algebraic curves and surfaces. For example, if $C$ is an algebraic curve defined by a polynomial equation, you can plot it using the following command: `plot(C)`. If $S$ is an algebraic surface defined by a system of polynomial equations, you can plot it using the following command: `plot3d(S)`.
