## Background Introduction

### The Emergence of Distributed Systems

Distributed systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to provide scalability, fault tolerance, and performance improvements compared to traditional centralized systems. With the rise of cloud computing, microservices architecture, and blockchain technology, distributed systems have become an essential part of modern software development.

### Challenges in Distributed Systems

Despite their benefits, distributed systems face several challenges, such as network latency, data inconsistencies, and failure handling. Ensuring data consistency across multiple nodes in a distributed system is critical to maintaining the reliability and accuracy of applications.

### Importance of Data Consistency

Data consistency refers to the state where all nodes in a distributed system agree on the same data at any given time. This agreement ensures that applications can rely on accurate and up-to-date information, even when dealing with concurrent updates or node failures.

## Core Concepts and Relationships

### Definition of Distributed Systems

A distributed system is a network of interconnected computers that communicate and coordinate to achieve a common goal. These systems can be classified into homogeneous or heterogeneous, depending on whether they use similar or different hardware and software components.

### Data Consistency Terminology

*Strong consistency:* All nodes see the same value simultaneously, ensuring immediate consistency.

*Eventual consistency:* Nodes eventually converge to the same value after some delay, allowing for temporary inconsistencies.

*Session consistency:* Within a single session, a user experiences strong consistency but may encounter temporary inconsistencies between sessions.

### CAP Theorem and Its Implications

The CAP theorem states that a distributed system cannot simultaneously guarantee consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. Instead, it must choose two out of these three guarantees. For example, a distributed system prioritizing consistency may sacrifice availability during network partitions, while a system emphasizing availability might tolerate temporary inconsistencies.

## Core Algorithms and Mathematical Models

### Two-Phase Commit (2PC) Protocol

#### Algorithm Steps

1. Transaction Preparation: The coordinator sends prepare requests to participating nodes.
2. Voting Phase: Each node votes to commit or abort the transaction based on local constraints.
3. Decision Phase: If all nodes vote to commit, the coordinator sends a commit command; otherwise, it sends an abort command.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages:

* Provides strong consistency.
* Simple implementation.

Disadvantages:

* Susceptible to blocking and failure scenarios.
* Poor performance in large-scale systems.

#### Latex Formula: $$2PC\ Formulas$$

$$
\begin{align*}
& \text{{Transaction}} \\
& \quad \text{{Phase 1 - Prepare: }} \textit{coordinator} \rightarrow \textit{participating\ nodes:} \ prepare(T)\\
& \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \ \ \, \textit{participating\ nodes:} \ \text{{vote}}\\
& \quad \text{{Phase 2 - Decision: }} \textit{coordinator} \rightarrow \textit{participating\ nodes:} \ decide(T)\\
& \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \ \ \, \textit{participating\ nodes:} \ \text{{commit/abort}}\
\end{align*}
$$

### Three-Phase Commit (3PC) Protocol

#### Algorithm Steps

1. Phase 1 - Prepare: Similar to 2PC's preparation phase.
2. Phase 2 - Promise: Participating nodes promise to participate in the transaction if allowed by local constraints.
3. Phase 3 - Decide: Same as 2PC's decision phase.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages:

* Improves fault tolerance over 2PC.
* Reduces chances of blocking.

Disadvantages:

* More complex than 2PC.
* Still susceptible to certain failure scenarios.

#### Latex Formula: $$3PC\ Formulas$$

$$
\begin{align*}
& \text{{Transaction}} \\
& \quad \text{{Phase 1 - Prepare: }} \textit{coordinator} \rightarrow \textit{participating\ nodes:} \ prepare(T)\\
& \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \ \ \, \textit{participating\ nodes:} \ \text{{vote}}\ and \ \textit{promise}\\
& \quad \text{{Phase 2 - Promise: }} \textit{coordinator} \leftarrow \textit{participating\ nodes:} \ promise\\
& \quad \text{{Phase 3 - Decide: }} \textit{coordinator} \rightarrow \textit{participating\ nodes:} \ decide(T)\\
& \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \ \ \, \textit{participating\ nodes:} \ \text{{commit/abort}}\
\end{align*}
$$

### Paxos Algorithm

#### Algorithm Steps

1. Proposer Phase: A proposer suggests a value and receives promises from acceptors.
2. Acceptors Phase: A majority of acceptors agree on the proposed value.
3. Learners Phase: Learners receive and accept the agreed-upon value.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages:

* Highly fault-tolerant.
* Suitable for large-scale systems.

Disadvantages:

* Complexity in implementing and understanding.
* Potential for slow convergence.

#### Latex Formula: $$Paxos\ Formulas$$

$$
\begin{align*}
& \text{{Proposer}} \\
& \quad \text{{Phase 1 - Prepare: }} \textit{proposer} \rightarrow \textit{acceptors:} \ prepare(N, V)\\
& \quad \text{{Phase 2 - Promise: }} \textit{acceptors} \rightarrow \textit{proposer:} \ promise(N', V')\\
& \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \ \ \, \textit{proposer:} \ \text{{choose}\ a\ new\ value}\ V\ \text{{if}\ necessary}}\\
& \text{{Acceptors}} \\
& \quad \text{{Phase 1 - Accept: }} \textit{acceptors} \rightarrow \textit{proposer:} \ accept(N, V)\\
& \text{{Learners}} \\
& \quad \text{{Phase 1 - Learn: }} \textit{learners} \leftarrow \textit{acceptors:} \ learn(N, V)\
\end{align*}
$$

### Raft Algorithm

#### Algorithm Steps

1. Leader Election: Nodes elect a leader through a series of rounds.
2. Log Replication: The leader replicates log entries across follower nodes.
3. Append Request: Clients send append requests to the leader.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages:

* Simpler implementation compared to Paxos.
* Suitable for practical applications.

Disadvantages:

* Slower than other algorithms in some scenarios.
* Less fault-tolerant than Paxos.

#### Latex Formula: $$Raft\ Formulas$$

$$
\begin{align*}
& \text{{Leader Election}} \\
& \quad \text{{Phase 1 - RequestVote: }} \textit{candidates} \rightarrow \textit{other\ nodes:} \ requestVote(term)\\
& \quad \text{{Phase 2 - AppendEntries: }} \textit{leader} \rightarrow \textit{followers:} \ appendEntries(term, prevLogIndex, prevLogTerm, entries, leaderId)\\
& \text{{Log Replication}} \\
& \quad \text{{Phase 1 - ClientRequest: }} \textit{client} \rightarrow \textit{leader:} \ clientRequest(command)\\
& \quad \text{{Phase 2 - AppendEntries: }} \textit{leader} \rightarrow \textit{followers:} \ appendEntries(term, prevLogIndex, prevLogTerm, entries, leaderId)\\
& \text{{Append Request}} \\
& \quad \text{{Phase 1 - ClientRequest: }} \textit{client} \rightarrow \textit{leader:} \ clientRequest(command)\\
&\qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \ \ \, \textit{leader:} \ \text{{append}\ the\ command\ to\ its\ logs}}\\
&\qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \ \ \, \textit{leader:} \ \text{{send}\ appendEntries\ messages}\
\end{align*}
