# 1.简介
  

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is one of the core components in Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves developing machine learning models that can understand human language by analyzing it to extract insights from text data. One of the important tasks of NLP is sentiment analysis, which involves classifying a piece of text as positive or negative based on its underlying emotional tone.

Sentiment analysis requires a robust preprocessing pipeline because every sentence has unique characteristics such as word choice, punctuations, negation, intonation, dialect etc., making traditional approaches like stopwords removal, stemming and lemmatization useless in this case. In addition to these, some specific lexicons and techniques need to be incorporated into the pipeline to improve accuracy. 

In this article, we will develop an end-to-end pre-processing pipeline for sentiment analysis using Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and gensim packages. The pipeline takes raw text data as input and returns processed text that can be used as input to a sentiment classifier. We will first cover relevant concepts, algorithms and operations needed to build this pipeline step by step followed by code examples. This article assumes readers have basic knowledge of Python programming and basic understanding of NLP terminologies and methods.

Overall, our goal is to provide a simple and efficient approach to building a robust sentiment analysis pre-processing pipeline using Python libraries NLTK and gensim. This pipeline should outperform standard approaches like stopword removal while also utilizing advanced techniques like part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition. Finally, we hope to encourage researchers and developers to use this pipeline in their own projects and benefit from the added value provided by modern natural language processing techniques.

## 2.1 Tokenization
Tokenization refers to breaking down a document or string into individual tokens or words. Tokens are usually defined as sequences of characters that belong together due to common meaning, e.g. "natural" and "language". Each token represents a meaningful unit of information that can be analyzed further. Common ways of tokenizing include splitting the string at whitespace characters (" ") or punctuation marks. Tokenized strings are often stored as lists of strings in computer memory.

Here's an example:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize, word_tokenize

text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
sentences = sent_tokenize(text) # split text into sentences
tokens = [word_tokenize(sentence) for sentence in sentences] # tokenize each sentence into words
print(tokens) 
```

Output:
```python
[['The', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox'], ['jumps', 'over', 'the', 'lazy'], ['dog.']]
```

## 2.2 Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS tagger)
Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is another essential component of NLP pipelines. POS tags represent each token as belonging to a particular category, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. POS tagging enables the system to capture more contextual information about the text and identify relationships between different parts of speech within a sentence. For instance, in the phrase "I love my cat", the pos tag of "cat" could be changed depending on whether it appears before or after the verb "love".

Gensim provides tools for performing POS tagging including PerceptronTagger and StanfordPOSTagger. Here's how they work:

### Perceptron Tagger
Perceptron Tagger is a probabilistic algorithm designed specifically for part-of-speech tagging. It works by training a model to predict the correct tag given a sequence of word embeddings (i.e. features representing each word). To train the model, you need labeled dataset with tagged instances, where each instance consists of a sequence of words and its corresponding true tag. After training, you can use the trained model to label new instances without requiring labels during training time.

You can download Perceptron Tagger model for English here: https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_sm-2.2.0/en_core_web_sm-2.2.0.tar.gz

Here's how you can load and use Perceptron Tagger in Python:

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
doc = nlp("She sells seashells.")
for token in doc:
    print(token.text, token.pos_)
```

Output:
```python
She PRON
sells VERB
seashells NOUN
. PUNCT
```

### Stanford POSTagger
Stanford POSTagger is a Java-based open source tool developed by Stanford University. It uses a linear chain CRF model to assign parts of speech tags to each token in a sentence. You can download Stanford POSTagger here: http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml

Here's how you can run Stanford POSTagger in Python:

```bash
java -mx4g -cp "*" edu.stanford.nlp.tagger.maxent.MaxentTagger -model /path/to/english-left3words-distsim.tagger -tagSeparator "|" -textFile path/to/inputfile > outputfile
```

You can then parse the output file to get the predicted POS tags for each token.
