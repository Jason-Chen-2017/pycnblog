Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a powerful machine learning algorithm that is widely used in various applications such as image classification, speech recognition, and text categorization. In this article, we will discuss two important techniques for feature scaling and regularization of the input features before applying an SVM model to improve its accuracy: Standardization and Regularization. We will use Python libraries scikit-learn and tensorflow to demonstrate these methods. Scikit-learn library contains many useful functions for implementing machine learning algorithms, including support vector machines (SVMs). TensorFlow is another popular deep learning framework with efficient implementations of neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

In order to understand how these techniques can be applied to SVM models, let’s first go through some basic concepts related to SVMs. 

## What is Support Vector Machine?
A support vector machine (SVM) is a type of supervised machine learning model that uses classification algorithms to create a decision boundary between different classes or labels. The objective of the SVM is to find the hyperplane that separates the data into distinct classes with maximum margin. Among other things, SVMs provide better results than logistic regression when dealing with imbalanced datasets and nonlinear data. 

The core idea behind SVMs lies within the concept of the “support vectors” which are the training instances that lie closest to the hyperplane. When a new instance comes in, it gets assigned to one class or the other based on which side of the hyperplane they fall. The key role played by support vectors in SVMs is to minimize the risk of overfitting while ensuring generalizability. Overfitting occurs when a model becomes too complex and starts fitting the noise present in the dataset instead of the underlying patterns. This happens because the model learns the idiosyncrasies of each training example instead of the overall pattern. By adding penalties and constraints to the loss function, we ensure that the SVM model stays under control.


The above picture shows the working of an SVM model. It represents the data points and their corresponding labels or categories. Here, the goal is to classify the blue dots from the red ones using a straight line called a hyperplane. The optimal hyperplane is chosen so that it maximizes the margin between the nearest data points belonging to different categories or classes. Points inside the margin area are considered positive examples, while those outside the margin area are negative examples. These boundaries between different classes allow us to make predictions about new data points.

## Problem Definition
Given a labeled dataset consisting of samples with features X and targets y where x_i ∈ R^n and y_i ∈ {-1, +1}, we want to train a binary classifier using SVM. Our task is to evaluate the effectiveness of two feature scaling and regularization techniques - standardization and regularization - on the performance of our trained model.

### Feature Scaling
Standardization refers to transforming the features of the input space to have zero mean and unit variance. This technique ensures that all variables have the same scale and prevents any variable dominating the decision making process. For example, if there are several features with vastly different scales, then standardizing them would help in reducing the impact of large coefficients.

Regularization adds a penalty term to the cost function of the optimization problem to discourage overfitting. The goal of regularization is to prevent the model from becoming too complex and unable to fit the training data. Regularization helps in minimizing the error rate on the validation set during the training phase. However, due to the additional penalty term added to the cost function, regularization may not always lead to improved performance. Therefore, we need to strike a balance between standardization and regularization by selecting appropriate values of alpha and lambda. 

We can perform feature scaling either manually or automatically using the scikit-learn library. If we choose to apply manual feature scaling, we can subtract the mean value of each feature from the respective observation, and then divide by the standard deviation of that particular feature. This process normalizes the distribution of each feature to have zero mean and unit variance. 

Here's an example implementation:

```python
from sklearn import preprocessing

scaler = preprocessing.StandardScaler().fit(X_train) # apply scaling to training set only
X_scaled_train = scaler.transform(X_train)

scaler = preprocessing.StandardScaler().fit(X_test) # reuse existing scaler object for test set
X_scaled_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

If we choose to automate the feature scaling process, we can simply pass the "scale" parameter in the constructor of the StandardScaler object to true. Additionally, we can also specify the range of the transformed features using the feature_range parameter of the same object.

```python
from sklearn import preprocessing

scaler = preprocessing.StandardScaler(scale=True, feature_range=(0, 1)).fit(X_train) 
X_scaled_train = scaler.transform(X_train)

scaler = preprocessing.StandardScaler(scale=False).fit(X_test) # reuse existing scaler object for test set
X_scaled_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

### Regularization
Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models. During training, regularization introduces a penalty term in the cost function that shrinks the weights towards zero. This encourages the model to focus less on the noise in the training set and more on the signal. Regularization terms can be of two types: L1 and L2 regularization.

#### L1 Regularization
L1 regularization involves adding the sum of absolute values of the parameters being optimized to the cost function. This encourages sparsity in the solution, i.e., encourages the optimizer to selectively include only few non-zero parameters in the solution. Mathematically, L1 regularization can be written as follows:

$$\min_{W} \frac{1}{2m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_{\theta}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^{2} + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{n}|w_{j}|$$

where $\lambda$ is the regularization coefficient. 

In code, L1 regularization can be achieved using the l1 argument in the SVC object from the scikit-learn library. For example, to add L1 regularization to a support vector machine classifier with a linear kernel, we can do the following:

```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC

clf = SVC(kernel='linear', C=1.0, random_state=0, gamma="auto", l1_ratio=0.5) # add L1 regularization with ratio 0.5
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

In addition to L1 regularization, we can also use L2 regularization, which is similar to L1 but adds the square of the magnitude of the weights to the cost function. L2 regularization can be implemented by setting the `penalty` argument in the SVC object to 'l2' and passing a suitable value for the `C` hyperparameter. For example, here's an SVM with L2 regularization:

```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC

clf = SVC(kernel='linear', C=1.0, random_state=0, gamma="auto", penalty='l2') # add L2 regularization with default ratio
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Both L1 and L2 regularizations can be combined together using Elastic Net regularization, which combines both L1 and L2 penalties by tuning the trade-off parameter `l1_ratio`. For example, here's an SVM with Elastic Net regularization:

```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC

clf = SVC(kernel='linear', C=1.0, random_state=0, gamma="auto", penalty='elasticnet', l1_ratio=0.5) # add Elastic Net regularization with ratio 0.5
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Note that Elastic Net regularization requires specifying the `penalty` argument as `'elasticnet'` and providing a value for the `l1_ratio` hyperparameter. While `l1_ratio` determines the relative importance of L1 vs. L2 regularization, a good rule of thumb is to start with small values like 0.1 and gradually increase until the desired level of regularization is reached.

In summary, regularization provides a way to prevent overfitting by introducing a penalty term in the cost function that forces the model to learn simpler solutions that generalize well to unseen data. The choice of regularization method depends on the specific scenario and the desired trade-off between simplicity and robustness against overfitting. Both L1 and L2 regularization produce sparse solutions, which makes them attractive for high-dimensional problems with many irrelevant features. Finally, elastic net regularization combines L1 and L2 regularization to achieve a balanced combination of strength and sparsity.
