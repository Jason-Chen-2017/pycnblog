Attention mechanism is a popular technique used to address the limitation of RNNs and CNNs as they cannot consider global dependencies across different positions in the input sequence. The attention mechanism is designed to selectively focus on certain parts of the input sequences based on their relevance to a particular output at a given time step. To visualize this mechanism, we can use techniques like heatmap or activation maximization which shows the distribution of attention weights assigned by the model for each position in the input sequence with respect to all other positions in the same sequence. However, these visualization methods are not effective when applied directly to transformer-based models such as BERT or GPT-2 due to their architecture complexity and multiple layers. In this article, I will present an alternative approach called integrated gradients that uses attention visualizations to understand how the model focuses on different parts of the input text during inference.

Integrated Gradients method generates feature importance scores for each token in the input sentence by approximating the integral of the gradient of the predicted label (in our case it would be the classification score) with respect to the features of interest (in our case it would be the tokens themselves). This approach allows us to identify the important features responsible for predicting the class label and also provides insight into what kind of information the model needs from the input text to make accurate predictions. 

In order to perform Integrated Gradients, we need to first define the reference value where we want the attributions to be computed. For example, if we want the attributions to be computed over a sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", then we should set the reference as the baseline sentence "A". We compute the integrated gradients for every word in the sentence and aggregate them to get the final attribution values for the whole sentence.

This article assumes readers have some familiarity with deep learning terminology, attention mechanisms, and NLP tasks. It also requires knowledge of Python programming language and its libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. The code examples provided in this article use Hugging Face’s transformers library. Finally, this article does not cover all possible variations of Integrated Gradients approaches and works only for transformer-based models.

# 2.Background Introduction
## What is attention? 
Attention mechanism refers to a memory mechanism that enables a network to focus on relevant items while ignoring irrelevant ones. Attention mechanisms have been used extensively in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, especially in the context of transformer-based models like BERT and GPT-2, which process large amounts of unstructured text data and produce state-of-the-art results in many applications.

Attention mechansims are commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures like seq2seq models, which consist of two separate components: an encoder that processes the source sequence and generates a fixed-size representation, and a decoder that consumes the encoded representation and produces the target sequence one element at a time. In these types of models, the decoder makes decisions based on individual elements generated by the encoder. Each decision involves looking at the entire encoded sequence up until that point. With attention mechanisms, the decoder learns to pay more attention to specific elements of the input sequence instead of looking at the entire sequence all at once.

For instance, let’s say we want to translate a sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" into English. One possible translation could be "L'oiseau saute par la fenêtre rapidement". Notice that the words 'quick', 'brown', and 'fox' are considered more relevant than others because they are part of the phrase 'quick brown fox'. Without attention mechanisms, the typical seq2seq model would assign equal weights to all elements in the input sequence equally, regardless of their relevance to producing the correct output. With attention mechanisms, the decoder would assign higher weights to those elements that contribute most to the prediction.

In machine learning literature, attention mechanisms are often referred to as additive attention, cumulative attention, location-based attention, and scaled dot-product attention. There are various variants of these concepts depending on the exact implementation details and application requirements. 

## Why do we visualize attention?  
Visualizing attention mechanisms helps us understand how well a model is attending to different parts of the input sequence, which may help us improve its performance. Visualization tools allow us to easily identify regions of the input sequence that are being ignored by the model due to low attention weights. Additionally, we can see patterns emerging from these high attention areas, which might indicate potential errors or unexpected behaviors within the model. Finally, we can debug or fine-tune the model based on these insights, leading to better performance in terms of accuracy and robustness. 

# 3.Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before we move forward with explaining the core algorithm and operations involved in Integrated Gradients, we need to clarify some basic concepts related to attention visualizations. 

## Key Components of Transformer Models
Transformer-based models are widely used for natural language processing tasks since they provide state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks including speech recognition, machine translation, text summarization, and question answering. Let’s take a closer look at the key components of these models: 

1. Embedding Layer: An embedding layer converts input tokens into dense vectors. Word embeddings capture semantic relationships between words, such as synonyms or similarities. These embeddings are learned jointly alongside the rest of the model parameters using backpropagation through time (BPTT).

2. Positional Encoding: Since neural networks typically operate on relative distances rather than absolute positions in space, positional encoding adds spatial information to the inputs before feeding them into the transformer layers. The positional encoding is added after adding the embeddings to the inputs but before applying any normalization or activation functions. Positional encodings have a dimensionality of $d_{model}$, which is usually set to 512 or 768 depending on the size of the embedding table. They are usually initialized randomly and trained end-to-end alongside the rest of the model.   

3. Encoder Layers: The encoder layers comprise stacks of self-attention layers followed by feedforward layers. Self-attention layers implement attention mechanism to focus on relevant items while ignoring irrelevant ones. Feedforward layers apply non-linear transformations to the outputs of the self-attention layers.  
   
4. Decoder Layers: Similar to the encoder layers, the decoder layers also comprise stacks of self-attention layers followed by feedforward layers. Unlike the encoder layers, however, the decoder layers include a third sublayer called cross-attention that enables it to attend to relevant items from the encoder output at each decoding step.  

 
## Attention Maps
Once the model has processed the input sequence, it returns a set of attention maps, one for each position in the sequence. Each attention map represents the weight assigned by the model to each position in the input sequence by considering the entire input sequence up until that point. Therefore, each row in an attention map corresponds to the attention weights assigned by the model to the current position, and each column corresponds to the attention weights assigned by the previous positions in the sequence. 

We can interpret each element of an attention map as follows: If the weight corresponding to the jth position in the input sequence is greater than zero, then the model is assigning a relatively larger weight to that position compared to other positions. On the other hand, if the weight is less than or equal to zero, then the model doesn’t assign much attention to that position. As a result, the sum of positive weights in each row gives us a sense of the overall impact of each position on the final prediction. High attention weights near boundaries of sentences indicate that the model has focused on these words closely and is likely making appropriate predictions. Lower attention weights indicate that the model hasn’t paid much attention to these words. 

However, attention maps alone don’t always give us enough insights into why the model is generating certain translations. Another piece of information we need is called “relevance,” which indicates whether each position was selected by the model as relevant to the task at hand. Relevance information tells us about the salience of each position in the input sequence and can be obtained from the model’s softmax function. Softmax assigns a probability mass to each output class, indicating the likelihood of the model selecting the corresponding position. By comparing the softmax probabilities to the attention maps, we can infer the relevance of each position in the input sequence and diagnose problems or errors in the model.

Finally, note that although attention visualizations are useful for understanding the behavior of attention mechanisms, they can be misleading in practice. Attention maps may show attention to trivialities that don’t matter at all, or be biased towards local features that don't accurately reflect the actual role of the model in the problem domain. Therefore, attention visualizations are best suited for troubleshooting and debugging purposes, not for drawing conclusions or deploying production systems.
