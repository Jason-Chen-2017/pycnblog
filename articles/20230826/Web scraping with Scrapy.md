# 1.简介
  

Web scraping 是一种在计算机上提取数据的技术，也是一种获取信息的有效手段。它可以用于获取网页数据、进行数据清洗、构建知识图谱等多个领域。其原理就是通过网络爬虫自动抓取网页源代码，然后解析提取其中所需要的信息，这种方法属于非侵入性的方法。

Scrapy是一个开源的Python框架，能够帮助开发者快速、高效地编写网络爬虫程序。它提供了强大的基于页面元素定位技术的选择器，可以轻松准确地从HTML文档中定位并抓取信息。同时也提供了多种扩展机制，包括插件、管道、组件等，可以灵活地对爬虫程序进行扩展。

Scrapy具备良好的可扩展性和扩展性，并且具有简单易用、高性能等优点。

本文将会详细介绍如何使用Scrapy框架进行网站爬虫开发，掌握网页数据采集及处理的技能。


# 2.基本概念术语说明
## 2.1.What is web scraping?
Web scraping 指的是利用编程技术从互联网上收集、整理、分析、储存或传输的数据。其关键过程一般分为两步：

- 第一个步骤是爬取：爬虫程序从网站上抓取网页源码（html/xml文件），然后提取特定信息并保存起来。
- 第二个步骤是分析：分析经过爬虫处理后的网页数据，并将其转换成适合后续使用的格式，如CSV、JSON、XML等。

由于网页数据的特性，通常需要对网页内容进行结构化的处理，才能得到用户想要的结果。

## 2.2.Terminology and key concepts
**Website:** A website is a collection of HTML documents that are hosted on a server and can be accessed through the internet using a URL (Uniform Resource Locator). The primary purpose of websites is to present information or services to users by displaying hypertext (links) and multimedia content such as images, videos, audio clips, and graphics. Some examples include: Google, Facebook, Yahoo! Mail, Amazon, etc.

**Web crawler**: A web crawler is a software program that systematically browses the web for data by following links from one page to another until all pages have been visited. It typically extracts and stores specific information found on each page in a structured format like CSV or JSON file. Common types of web crawlers include robots.txt compliant bots, spiders, scanners, and indexers.

**Spider middleware:** Spider middleware enables developers to modify or enhance the behavior of their spiders. It’s essentially a piece of code that sits between the web crawler and the website being scraped and allows for customizations and extensions that can be used to customize how URLs are followed, how responses are handled, and more. Examples of popular spider middlewares include Splash, Autothrottle, and DepthMiddleware.

**Scrapy:** Scrapy is an open source and collaborative framework used for developing complex web spiders. It provides several features such as automatic downloading of dependencies, multiple concurrent requests, built-in scheduling system, and support for both Python and JavaScript engines. It also includes powerful extension mechanism which makes it easy to build new functionalities into scrapers.

**Selector:** Selectors are objects in Scrapy that allow us to select specific elements from a webpage document based on certain criteria. They provide methods to filter out unwanted elements and process the selected ones according to our needs. There are two types of selectors in Scrapy - XPath and CSS. XPath selector is based on XML path language and is often preferred over CSS when working with XML documents.

**Item:** An item represents a single entity extracted from a web page. Each item object consists of fields, where each field contains the value of a particular attribute of the corresponding HTML element. We define items using classes in Scrapy, which describe the structure of the data we want to extract from the webpages. Items are similar to tables in relational databases and contain columns and rows of data, just like a regular spreadsheet.

**Pipeline:** Pipelines are modules that perform operations on items during the crawl process. They enable us to implement common tasks like storing scraped data in database, filtering duplicates, cleaning and enhancing the data before storing it, etc. In Scrapy, pipelines are defined separately from spiders and can be reused across projects. Pipeline components communicate with other components via signals.

**Crawlera:** Crawlera is a paid service provided by Scrapinghub that offers high performance, scalability, and ease of use for running Scrapy spiders. It runs Scrapy spiders inside lightweight containers on its own infrastructure. It is not necessary to install any additional tools or libraries on your local machine if you opt for this option. Additionally, they offer various pricing plans depending on the volume of traffic you expect.

## 2.3.Other important terms
- **Asynchronous programming model**: Asynchronous programming refers to the ability of different parts of a program to execute independently without waiting for each other. This means that programs do not block while waiting for I/O operations to complete, reducing response times and increasing overall efficiency. The most prevalent async programming model is Event Driven Programming (EDP), where events are generated by hardware devices and processed asynchronously at a later time.
- **Distributed computing**: Distributed computing refers to the practice of executing parallel computations across multiple computers or machines. One example of a distributed computing platform is Hadoop, which is widely used for big data processing.
