This is an advanced tutorial that assumes some familiarity with basic statistics concepts like probability distributions, covariance matrix, variance and standard deviation.

Let's get started!

# 2.基本概念术语说明
## What is Gaussian mixture model?
A gaussian mixture model (GMM) is a probabilistic model consisting of a set of $k$ normal distributions with unknown parameters $\mu_j$, $\sigma^2_j$. It represents a generative process where each point is drawn from one of the $k$ component distributions independently at random. The goal of GMM is to learn the optimal distribution of the input data without any prior knowledge of the number of components or their locations. Mathematically, GMM can be written as follows:

$$p(x \mid \theta) = \sum_{j=1}^k \pi_j N(\frac{x-\mu_j}{\sqrt{\sigma^2_j}},\sigma^2_j) $$

where $\theta = \{ \pi_j,\mu_j,\sigma^2_j \}_{1\leq j \leq K}$ denotes the parameter vector containing the weights ($\pi_j$) of each component distribution, mean values ($\mu_j$) and variances ($\sigma^2_j$) of each component distribution. $\pi_j$ represents the proportionality between the $j^{th}$ component distribution and all other components.

The above formula defines the joint probability of observing a sample $x$ given the parameters $\theta$. The summation over $j$ involves normalizing the probabilities of the individual components. The normal density function with mean $\mu_j$ and variance $\sigma^2_j$ is defined as $N(x; \mu_j, \sigma^2_j)$, which provides a mathematical basis for describing the shape of the pdf.

In GMM, each cluster has its own unique distribution, and points tend to belong to the cluster with higher weight. This means that if we have two clusters $(C_1, C_2)$ and their respective centroids $\bar{x}_i$ and $\bar{x}_j$, then a point $x$ tends to belong to $C_i$ if $p(C_i \mid x) > p(C_j \mid x)$.

Therefore, the overall objective of GMM is to find the best mixture of $K$ normal distributions that represent the underlying structure of the input data while also making sense of the relationship among them. We use EM algorithm to optimize the parameters $\theta$ of the model iteratively until convergence.

## Why do we need GMM?
One of the key advantages of GMM over traditional clustering algorithms such as K-Means is its ability to handle complex data structures with multiple modes. Traditional clustering methods only consider the location of the centers, but not the shape or spread of the distributions within the clusters. In contrast, GMM allows us to capture both the location and shape of the clusters by defining them through the mean and variance of the multivariate normal distributions. GMM is particularly useful when there are overlapping or distinct clusters present in the data, where K-Means may fail due to its rigid definition of a center point. Additionally, GMM enables us to extract meaningful insights about the data by analyzing the contribution of each cluster to the total log-likelihood. Finally, GMM is computationally efficient compared to K-Means since it requires fewer iterations to converge.

## Types of GMM models
We can classify GMM into several types based on whether they assume a fixed number of clusters, trainable or non-trainable, and hyperparameters.

### Fixed-number GMM
Fixed-number GMM refers to those GMM models whose number of components $K$ is predefined during training. These models typically require less computational resources than the others. One example of this type of GMM is the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model, which uses a stick-breaking representation to avoid having zero probability mass for the first component. Another common variant is the Von Mises Fisher mixture model, which treats the GMM as a mixture of von Mises distributions. All of these variants assume that the number of components is predetermined and known apriori.

### Trainable GMM
Trainable GMM refers to those GMM models where the number of components and their parameters are learned from labeled data during training. Examples of this type of model include Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM), which estimate the parameters of the normal distributions using a conjugate prior distribution and variational inference. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) that reconstruct images or sequences of observations can also be viewed as special cases of trainable GMM models.

### Non-trainable GMM
Non-trainable GMM refers to those GMM models that do not rely on labeled data during training. They instead apply clustering or dimension reduction techniques to obtain an initial guess for the partitioning of the input space. These models usually work well in practice even though they may not provide the most accurate results. One prominent example of this category is Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## How does GMM work?
To understand how GMM works, let’s take an example where we want to group a set of three points into two clusters. Here is the step-by-step procedure:

1. Initialize the parameters of the GMM:
   - Choose the number of components K, say 2. 
   - Randomly initialize the proportions $\pi_j$ uniformly such that $\sum_j \pi_j = 1$. 
   - For each component, choose a mean value $\mu_j$ randomly and assign a positive semidefinite covariance matrix $\Sigma_j$. 
   
    $$\Sigma_j = \begin{pmatrix}\sigma_1^2 & \rho\sigma_1\sigma_2 \\ \rho\sigma_1\sigma_2 & \sigma_2^2\end{pmatrix}$$

   where $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ are the standard deviations along the principal axes, and $\rho$ is the correlation coefficient between the two dimensions.

2. E-step: Compute the responsibilities $\gamma_ik$ for each data point i:

    $$\gamma_ik = \frac{\pi_k N(x_i|\mu_k,\Sigma_k)}{\sum_{l=1}^{K} \pi_l N(x_i|\mu_l,\Sigma_l)}$$

   where $N(x_i|\mu_k,\Sigma_k)$ is the conditional probability of observation $x_i$ under the $k^{th}$ component distribution with mean $\mu_k$ and covariance $\Sigma_k$.

3. M-step: Update the parameters according to the maximum likelihood estimates:

   - Recompute the component weights $\pi_k$:

      $$\pi_k = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \gamma_ik$$

   - Recompute the means $\mu_k$:

      $$\mu_k = \frac{1}{N_k} \sum_{i=1}^N \gamma_ik x_i$$

   - Recompute the covariances $\Sigma_k$:

     $$\Sigma_k = \frac{1}{N_k} \sum_{i=1}^N \gamma_ik [x_i - \mu_k] [x_i - \mu_k]^T + \lambda I$$

     where $\lambda$ is a smoothing factor and $I$ is an identity matrix representing the same scale.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence. At this stage, we have obtained the final solution that maximizes the log-likelihood of the observed data.


## Anomaly Detection Using GMM
Now that we know what GMM is, let’s go ahead and use it for anomaly detection. We will build a simple experiment to see how GMM performs in identifying anomalous data. Our synthetic data generation method consists of creating a set of normally distributed clusters and adding some noise to simulate the presence of outliers outside of the clusters. We will fit a GMM model to the original data and plot the predicted cluster assignments. Then, we will compare the predicted labels to the true labels to evaluate the performance of the GMM model.

Here are the steps we'll follow:

1. Generate Synthetic Data: First, we'll create a set of normally distributed clusters and add some noise to it. We'll call this "synthetic" because it is derived from some underlying latent variable and thus cannot be easily identified using simple statistical measures. 

2. Fit GMM to Synthetic Data: Next, we'll fit a GMM to our synthetic data and predict the cluster membership for each point. To do so, we'll use the `mixture` module in sklearn.

3. Plot Results: After obtaining the predictions, we'll plot the predicted labels against the true labels to visualize the accuracy of our classifier. Specifically, we'll use scatter plots to show the locations of points grouped by predicted label versus actual label. Note that false positives correspond to points classified incorrectly as an outlier, whereas false negatives correspond to points classified correctly as being inside the cluster.

4. Evaluate Performance: Finally, we'll compute metrics to assess the quality of our prediction. Common metrics include precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curve area under the curve. We should aim to achieve high precision and recall levels, although in practice high scores don't always correlate with good performance.
