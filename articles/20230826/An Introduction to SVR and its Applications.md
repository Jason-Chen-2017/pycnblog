Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a type of supervised learning algorithm used for regression analysis or prediction problems where the dependent variable y can take on only limited numbers of values. It works by finding the hyperplane that best separates the data into two classes based on their target values. The idea behind Support Vector Regression is similar to linear regression except it uses a kernel function instead of simple linear regression to find non-linear relationships between features and labels. The main difference between SVR and traditional Linear Regression is how the model is trained and evaluated. In Linear Regression, we train our model using Gradient Descent optimization technique while in SVR, we use a technique called support vector machines (SVMs). This article will provide an introduction to SVR and its applications including classification, regression and time series forecasting problems. We'll also explore how these algorithms work under the hood.

2.基本概念术语
- Dependent Variable: The variable we are trying to predict or understand. For example, if we want to predict the price of a house, then the dependent variable would be "price". If we want to classify different types of animals as mammals vs birds, then the dependent variable would be whether each animal was classified as a mammal or bird.
- Independent Variables: These are variables which affect the dependent variable. For example, if we have the information about age, size, number of rooms, location, etc., then those independent variables could be used to predict the value of the dependent variable. In this case, age, size, number of rooms and location are independent variables affecting the dependent variable price.
- Training Dataset: A set of observations used to train the machine learning model. Each observation consists of one or more independent variables and the corresponding dependent variable value.
- Testing Dataset: A separate set of observations from the training dataset used to evaluate the performance of the learned model. It contains all the same features as the training dataset but with some differences such as being unseen during training.
- Hyperplane: A mathematical representation of the decision boundary between two sets of points in n-dimensional space. A hyperplane is generally defined by its normal vector and the distance from the origin. In two dimensions, it looks like a line, in higher dimensional spaces, it looks like a plane.
- Kernel Function: A function used to transform the input feature space into a higher dimension space so that complex nonlinear relationships between the features and labels can be modeled. The most commonly used kernel functions are Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial Function and Sigmoid Function. They produce smooth decision boundaries and allow us to handle datasets containing irregularities and outliers.
- Criterion Function: A measure of how well the model has fit the data. There are various criteria functions used in SVR depending upon the problem at hand. One common criterion function is Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Regularization Parameter: A parameter used to control the tradeoff between fitting the training data well and avoiding overfitting the model to the training data. The larger the regularization parameter, the less likely the model will overfit the training data.
- Hyperparameters: Parameters involved in the process of training the model that cannot be learned directly from the data. Examples include the regularization parameter, epsilon-insensitive loss parameter and gamma parameter used in RBF kernel.

3.核心算法原理及具体操作步骤
Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a type of supervised learning algorithm used for regression analysis or prediction problems where the dependent variable y can take on only limited numbers of values. The goal of SVR is to find the hyperplane that best separates the data into two classes based on their target values. However, in contrast to traditional Linear Regression, SVR finds the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between both the classes. An illustration of this concept is shown below:


In order to achieve this, SVR employs a kernel function to transform the input feature space into a higher dimension space so that complex nonlinear relationships between the features and labels can be modeled. The basic steps involved in building an SVM are:

1. Choose a kernel function - The choice of kernel function depends on the complexity of the relationship between the features and the dependent variable y. Commonly used kernels include polynomial, radial basis function (RBF) and sigmoid.
RBF function takes two inputs x and y, applies a radial basis function on them and outputs the resultant value which is multiplied by a scalar coefficient alpha. Alpha controls the tradeoff between choosing the hyperplane which correctly classifies the samples and ensuring that there is no misclassification of any sample. 

2. Find the maximum margin separator - To find the maximum margin separator, we need to solve the following constrained quadratic optimization problem: 

min_w ||w||^2 + C * sum_{i=1}^n (max{0, 1 - y_i*(w^Tx_i)}) 
subject to:
0 <= w[j] <= M (for j = 0 to d-1, where d is the number of features)
    where w[j] represents the weight assigned to feature j, n is the number of training examples, 
    M is a large positive constant, and C is a small positive constant.
    
This problem asks to minimize the L2 norm of the weights and subject to constraints that ensure that all the sample points lie within the maximum margin circle centered at the hyperplane, i.e., y_i(w^Tx_i) >= 1 for all i=1 to n. 

The solution to this problem is given by:

arg min_w max_k (sum_{i} [y_i - k(x_i)]^(2)) + lambda||w||^2, s.t. |w|<=C

where lambda is a regularization term that controls the amount of shrinkage applied to the weights. 

Now, let's look closely at what happens when we apply this step to a real dataset. Suppose we have a dataset consisting of two classes, one having blue dots and other red dots. Here's how we can apply the above algorithm to learn the best separating hyperplane:

1. Define the kernel function - We choose the RBF kernel since it fits well with the geometry of our problem and allows us to capture the nonlinearity present in our data.

2. Train the model - First, we split our dataset into training and testing subsets. Next, we compute the parameters of the model (weights and bias terms) by minimizing the cost function using gradient descent techniques.

3. Make predictions - Finally, we test the accuracy of our model on the testing subset and compare it with other models. Based on the results, we may decide to refine the model further by adjusting the hyperparameters or changing the kernel function.

With these steps, we've built a robust SVM classifier capable of handling non-linear relationships between the features and labels. Now, let's discuss some practical aspects of applying SVR in practice.

4. Classification Problem
Suppose you're working on a classification task and your dataset consists of numerical features and a categorical label column. Here's how you can apply SVMs for binary classification:

1. Preprocess the data - Since SVM performs better when the input features are standardized, we should preprocess the data before proceeding further.

2. Feature engineering - Some features might perform better than others in distinguishing the two classes. Hence, we should try adding new features or removing redundant ones to improve the accuracy of our model.

3. Apply SVMs - After preprocessing the data, we can now apply SVMs to learn a binary classifier. We first split our dataset into training and testing subsets and compute the parameters of the model using gradient descent techniques. Finally, we test the accuracy of our model on the testing subset and tune the hyperparameters if necessary.

Similar to the previous section, we've successfully applied SVMs to a classification task. Let's move on to the next part where we'll see how SVR can be used for regression tasks.

5. Regression Problem
Regression problems involve predicting continuous outcomes rather than discrete categories. Here's how SVR can be used for regression problems:

1. Preprocess the data - As usual, we should preprocess the data before applying SVMs for regression.

2. Choose a suitable kernel function - For regression problems, we often use either a RBF or a polynomial kernel. Both kernels can capture non-linear relationships between the input features and the output label.

3. Split the dataset - Similar to classification problems, we should split our dataset into training and testing subsets.

4. Train the model - Once the data is preprocessed and split, we can start training the SVM model using gradient descent techniques. The cost function we use here is typically mean squared error (MSE).

5. Evaluate the model - Finally, we test the accuracy of our model on the testing subset and tweak the hyperparameters accordingly.

Overall, SVMs are powerful tools for solving a variety of supervised learning problems. By combining multiple algorithms, they can build highly accurate and efficient models for a wide range of applications.
