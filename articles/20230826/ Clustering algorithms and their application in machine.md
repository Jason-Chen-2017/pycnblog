# 1.简介
  

Cluster analysis or clustering is a set of techniques that groups similar data points together into clusters so that they can be easily analyzed and understood. In this article, we will cover some popular clustering algorithms with the goal to provide insights on how these algorithms work under the hood and what are their applications in modern machine learning systems.

Machine learning models require large amounts of labeled training data for accurate predictions. The process of extracting meaningful patterns from unstructured data such as text documents requires clustering techniques that group related observations together based on their similarity or distance measures. These algorithms can also help identify outliers or anomalies within the dataset, which may have significant impacts on model performance. Moreover, cluster analysis can improve data visualization by highlighting patterns among the data points, making it easier to identify relationships between variables and categories. 

In summary, cluster analysis has become increasingly important in various fields due to its ability to extract meaningful patterns from massive datasets while providing valuable insights into complex problems. This article aims to guide readers through fundamental concepts of clustering and present relevant theory alongside practical implementation using Python libraries such as scikit-learn. By understanding how different clustering algorithms work, you should be able to apply them effectively in your own projects and create efficient solutions for your business needs.

# 2.基本概念和术语
## 2.1.What is clustering? 
Clustering refers to the task of dividing a collection of objects into subsets or clusters such that each object belongs to only one subset (cluster) and all the objects within a cluster are similar to each other. Formally, given a set $X$ of points $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N$, where $x_i \in X$, the goal of clustering is to find a partition of $X$ into disjoint sets $C=\{C_j\}_{j=1}^k$, such that:

1. Each point is assigned to exactly one cluster $C_j$.
2. Objects in the same cluster are very similar to each other, i.e., there exists a measure of similarity between any two points inside a cluster.
3. There exist no empty clusters.

The resulting partitions $C$ are called clusters or clusters of points, respectively.

Therefore, the objective of clustering is to reduce dimensionality by grouping similar instances together. It helps in detecting patterns and outliers in the dataset, enabling us to make more informed decisions about our problem domain. Additionally, clustering allows us to better understand the underlying structure of the data by identifying clusters of highly similar examples.

## 2.2.Types of clustering methods

### 2.2.1.Partitioning-based methods
Partitioning-based clustering methods divide the input space into Voronoi cells or regions and assign each sample to the cell whose center is closest to the sample. Common partitioning-based clustering methods include k-means, Fuzzy C-Means, and DBSCAN.

#### K-Means
K-means is a simple but powerful algorithm used to classify a set of observations into a predefined number of clusters. The main idea behind K-Means is to partition the n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as the prototype of the cluster.

Here's how it works:

1. Initialize k centroids randomly from the n observations.
2. Repeat until convergence:
   - Assign each observation to the nearest centroid.
   - Update the centroids to be the means of the corresponding clusters.

The final result is a partition of the n observations into k clusters, where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest centroid.

#### Fuzzy C-Means
Fuzzy C-Means is a fuzzy version of K-Means that assumes that the observations belong to multiple clusters rather than just to a single cluster. This leads to more flexible partitionings, which can capture non-convex shapes and deviations from the typical shape of the data distribution.

Here's how it works:

1. Set up parameters alpha > 0, beta > 0, gamma ≥ 0, and U ∈ [0, 1]
2. Generate random membership values u_ij for every pair of samples x_i and c_j according to a Dirichlet distribution with concentration parameter alpha: 
   - u_ij ~ Dir(alpha)
3. Set the initial cluster centers c^1 = {c^1}_j = 1/n sum_{i=1}^n u_ij x_i 
4. Do until converged:
    - For each j:
        - Compute new cluster center c^t_j = (gamma/n) sum_{i=1}^n w^(t)_ij x_i
            - Where w^(t)_ij = ((u_ij)^beta) / sum_{i=1}^n ((u_ik)^beta), if |x_i| <= |x_j|, otherwise 0 
        - Update membership values u_ij to reflect move towards the new center: 
            - If |x_i - c^t_j| >= delta, then 
                - Set u_ij <- min(U, exp(-|x_i - c^t_j|^2/(2*(delta**2))))
            - Otherwise, do nothing 
    - Update estimate of global minimum cost J^(t+1):
           - Sum over j of ||x_i - c^{t+1}_j||^2 + lambda(||c^t_j - c^{t+1}_j||^2 - D)
5. Output cluster assignments c_j and the estimated global minimum cost J^(T).

#### DBSCAN
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is another common partitioning-based method that identifies clusters based on density connectedness. The basic idea is to define clusters around core points, expanding outward recursively based on distances and density levels. Points classified as noise are discarded during processing.

DBSCAN works as follows:

1. Determine epsilon, the maximum radius of neighborhood. All points within this radius are part of the same cluster.
2. Mark all points as either core or border point. A core point is a point with at least minPts neighbors. Border points are points that are close to a core point but not included in its neighbor set.
3. Recursively expand clusters from core points, adding adjacent border points to the current cluster. Stop when all remaining points are noise or reach a certain size limit.

### 2.2.2.Hierarchical methods
Hierarchical methods organize objects into a hierarchy of nested clusters. Common hierarchical clustering methods include agglomerative clustering, divisive clustering, and spectral clustering.

#### Agglomerative clustering
Agglomerative clustering starts by assuming that each observation forms its own cluster, and merges pairs of clusters until the desired number of clusters is obtained. The linkage criteria determines how to compute distances between clusters, typically as the Euclidean distance between their respective prototypes. Common linkage criteria include single, complete, average, and centroid.

Here's how it works:

1. Start with k singleton clusters, one for each observation.
2. Merge pairs of clusters iteratively based on the selected linkage criterion:
   - Find the two most similar clusters, subject to a threshold on the decrease in variance explained if merging would result in increased mutual information.
   - Combine the two clusters into a larger cluster.
3. Repeat steps 2 until the desired number of clusters is obtained.

#### Divisive clustering
Divisive clustering involves starting with one cluster containing all observations, and repeatedly splitting a subset of the cluster until each subset contains only one observation. At each step, a dendrogram is constructed to show the split pattern. Common splitting metrics include sum of squares error, increase in total intra-cluster variation, and decrease in inter-cluster variation.

Here's how it works:

1. Start with a cluster containing all n observations.
2. Iteratively remove half of the largest clusters and use a reassignment metric to determine the best division point for the remaining cluster. Common metrics include variance, entropy, and gain ratio.
3. Continue iterating until each observation is assigned to its own cluster.

#### Spectral clustering
Spectral clustering involves embedding the data into a low dimensional space and applying clustering algorithms in this lower-dimensional space. Specifically, it uses graph Laplacian eigenmaps to obtain a representation of the data that minimizes the heat kernel matrix, which captures both geometry and similarity of the data points. Common clustering algorithms include k-means and Gaussian mixtures.

Here's how it works:

1. Construct a similarity graph G between the n observations, where edge weight ij represents the similarity between x_i and x_j computed using a distance function. Common distance functions include euclidean distance, cosine distance, and correlation coefficient.
2. Normalize the graph laplacian eigenvectors associated with the smallest k nonzero eigenvalues to form a reduced feature map Z.
3. Apply standard clustering algorithms like k-means or Gaussian mixture models to the transformed data Z to obtain a set of k clusters.
