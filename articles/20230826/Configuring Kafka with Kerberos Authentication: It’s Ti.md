# 1.简介
  

Apache Kafka is a popular open-source distributed messaging system used in many industries such as finance, banking, IoT and telecommunications. In this article, we will explain how to set up and configure Apache Kafka for authentication using Kerberos technology. 

When working on large scale data processing systems or microservices architectures, security becomes an important aspect that needs to be addressed. One of the most common mechanisms used for ensuring secure communication between different services within an enterprise network is Kerberos authentication mechanism which provides mutual authentication amongst all services based on their respective keytabs files. Kafka also supports Kerberos authentication via SASL/JAAS configuration parameters but it requires some additional configurations compared to other security protocols like SSL/TLS where Kerberos can work out-of-the-box without any extra settings.

This article assumes that you have basic knowledge of both Apache Kafka and Kerberos technologies. We will provide necessary background information about these topics and then discuss the main components involved in setting up and configuring Kafka for Kerberos authentication. The second part of the article will cover specific steps required to implement Kerberos authentication using the jaas.conf file and further enhance the security of Kafka by incorporating SSL encryption. Finally, the concluding part will highlight future challenges and opportunities faced while implementing Kerberos authentication on Kafka. 

By completing this article, you should gain a deeper understanding of Kafka's integration with Kerberos authentication protocol and get started on securing your Kafka deployment by integrating it into your existing infrastructure.

# 2.基本概念术语
## 2.1 Apache Kafka
Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed streaming platform designed to process real-time data feeds from multiple sources simultaneously. Its primary use cases include building real-time dashboards, event streaming pipelines, and logging aggregation. It has a high throughput capability and low latency requirements making it ideal for applications requiring continuous processing of massive amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data quickly. It offers a range of features including message ordering, replayability, retention policies, fault tolerance, and scalability.

The core concept behind Apache Kafka is its ability to handle streams of records, called messages. Each message is assigned to a topic partition. Messages are stored in partitions, which ensures that the order of messages is maintained even when there are failures or rebalances. Partitions are distributed across brokers, which form a cluster. Brokers store and serve partition replicas, providing redundancy against node failures.

## 2.2 Kerberos
Kerberos is a centralized authentication service developed by Sun Microsystems. It enables users to establish trusted identity by validating user identities, server identities, and encrypting communication channels. A unique identifier known as tickets is issued to each user upon successful validation. The client uses tickets to authenticate to servers and obtain access rights. By default, clients only need to present valid tickets during login, thereby eliminating the need for usernames and passwords throughout the network.

In simpler terms, Kerberos works by having one entity (known as the Key Distribution Centre or KDC) issue tickets to authenticated principals, such as users, hosts, and services. Clients make requests to the KDC to obtain valid ticket-granting tickets (TGTs), which they can use to request access to resources protected by the Kerberos authentication protocol. TGTs are typically obtained through an interactive logon process where a user enters his or her username and password. If a ticket cannot be granted due to invalid credentials or the policy being violated, an error response is returned.

## 2.3 JAAS Configuration
JAAS stands for Java Authentication and Authorization Service. It is a framework provided by Java SE/EE to manage application authentication and authorization tasks. It allows developers to write code to integrate various authentication mechanisms easily. The JAAS module reads the configuration details specified in the jaas.conf file located inside the $JAVA_HOME/lib/security directory. This conf file specifies the provider class name, options, and the LoginContext implementation classes to be used for performing the actual authentication. Once configured correctly, JAAS allows Java programs to perform mutual authentication using the Kerberos protocol.

# 3.核心算法原理及具体操作步骤
1. Prerequisite setup
   To begin with, we need to install the following dependencies:

   * kafka_2.11-0.10.2.1 
   * krb5-server 
   * jdk

2. Setup Kafka configuration

  ```
  [root@kafka ~]# mkdir /etc/kafka 
  [root@kafka ~]# vim /etc/kafka/server.properties
  # Zookeeper quorum. This is a comma separated list of host:port pairs.
  zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181
  
  # Broker id
  broker.id=0
  
  ##listeners为监听地址端口，多个之间用逗号分隔，这个值可以根据实际环境设置，这里就先设置为默认即可
  listeners=PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092
  
  ##advertised.listeners 为其它客户端连接时的地址端口，可配置为空表示跟listeners保持一致
  advertised.listeners=PLAINTEXT://kafka.example.com:9092
  
  # specify security protocol used to communicate with clients
  security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT
  
  # enable SASL_PLAINTEXT authentication over PLAINTEXT
  sasl.mechanism.inter.broker.protocol=PLAIN
  
  # listener config
  ssl.client.auth=none
  ssl.keystore.location=/path/to/keystores/ks1.jks
  ssl.keystore.password=<PASSWORD>
  ssl.truststore.location=/path/to/truststores/ts1.jks
  ssl.truststore.password=<PASSWORD>
  
  ##sasl config
  ##kerberos服务端配置参数
  ##realm为 kerberos 数据库中的域名(就是你的realm)
  ##kdc值为 kerberos 数据库服务器ip地址
  ##adminServerKeytabPath为 管理员keytab文件路径
  ##userServerKeytabPath为 用户keytab文件路径
  sasl.enabled.mechanisms=GSSAPI
  sasl.kerberos.service.name=kafka
  sasl.kerberos.domain.name=EXAMPLE.COM
  sasl.kerberos.principal=broker/kafka.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
  sasl.kerberos.keytab=/var/run/secrets/broker.keytab
  sasl.kerberos.principal=zookeeper/hadoop.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
  sasl.kerberos.keytab=/var/run/secrets/zookeeper.keytab
  ```

  Here, we have enabled the SSL encryption option for inter-node communication using TLSv1.2. You may choose to disable SSL encryption if not needed for your particular use case. 

3. Configure Kafka environment variables

    ```
    export KAFKA_OPTS="-Djava.security.auth.login.config=/etc/kafka/jaas.conf"
    ```

    > Note: Set the path of `jaas.conf` file according to your installation location.


4. Create Kafka keystore & truststore

    ```
    openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 730 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /path/to/keystores/ks1.key -out /path/to/keystores/ks1.crt 
    keytool -import -alias $(hostname) -file /path/to/keystores/ks1.crt -keystore /path/to/keystores/ks1.jks -storepass changeit -noprompt
    
    cp /path/to/keystores/ks1.jks /path/to/truststores/ts1.jks  
    ```
    
  These commands create a self-signed certificate, import it to the Kafka keystore (`ks1`), and copy it to the corresponding truststore (`ts1`). You can modify them according to your desired keystore and truststore paths and passphrases.

5. Generate admin Server principal keytab

  Generate an administrator keytab file for the server with administrative privileges (which includes creating new topics). Specify the relevant domain and keytab paths in the `jaas.conf` file below:

     ```
     Client {
        com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
        useKeyTab=true
        keyTab="/path/to/admin/keytab"
        storeKey=false
        doNotPrompt=true
        useTicketCache=true
        debug=true
        principal="admin/adminserver@EXAMPLE.COM";
     };
     
     AdminServer {
        com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
        useKeyTab=true
        keyTab="/path/to/admin/keytab"
        storeKey=false
        doNotPrompt=true
        useTicketCache=true
        debug=true
        serviceName="kafka"
        hostnameOverride="kafka.example.com"
        principal="admin/adminserver@EXAMPLE.COM";
     };
     ```

     
6. Generate user Server principal keytab

  Generate a user keytab file for the server with read-only access to topics. Similarly, specify the relevant domain and keytab paths in the `jaas.conf` file below:

  ```
  UserServer {
         com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
         useKeyTab=true
         keyTab="/path/to/user/keytab"
         storeKey=false
         doNotPrompt=true
         useTicketCache=true
         debug=true
         serviceName="kafka"
         hostnameOverride="kafka.example.com"
         principal="user/userserver@EXAMPLE.COM";
      };
  ```


  > Note: Ensure that the principal names match those listed under "sasl.kerberos.principal" in the server properties file above.


    
7. Start ZooKeeper and Kafka processes

    ```
    sudo systemctl start zkserver
    sudo systemctl start kafka
    ```

    Verify whether the Kafka server is running successfully by checking the logs at `/var/log/kafka`. All errors related to Kafka authentication would appear here. 

8. Testing the setup

   Test the setup by creating a new topic using the command line utility `kafka-topics`:

   ```
  ./bin/kafka-topics --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
       --topic myTopic --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1 \
       --config min.insync.replicas=1
   ```

   Replace `localhost:9092` with the appropriate bootstrap server address depending on your setup. Check the log file again to ensure that no errors occur during startup.
