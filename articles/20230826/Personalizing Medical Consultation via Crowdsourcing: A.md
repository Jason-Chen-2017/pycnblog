Crowdsourcing (众包)是一种新的在线服务模式，允许个人或团队利用自己的资源来解决某些日益复杂的问题。例如，收集数据、调查研究、创建知识图谱、进行模拟游戏等。Crowdsourced solutions have many potential benefits compared with traditional methods for solving complex problems such as human intervention or information processing. However, there is a lack of rigorous research on crowdsourced medical consultations and their implications for patient care. The goal of this paper is to systematically review the literature related to personalized medical consultation using crowdsourcing technologies, providing an in-depth understanding of its current state of development and future challenges. In particular, we focus on four main aspects of crowdsourced medical consultation research: (i) data sources used by clinicians; (ii) techniques used for creating questionnaires; (iii) machine learning algorithms used for answering questions; and (iv) evaluation metrics used to assess quality and utility of crowdsourced solutions. We discuss the implications of these findings for the field of medical informatics, including how data collected from crowdsourced solutions can be used to improve patient outcomes, improve clinical decision making, and enable more accurate diagnoses and treatments.

This work reviews the literature related to the use of crowdsourcing technologies for personalized medical consultation. Firstly, we describe the different types of crowdsourcing services that exist for personalized medical consultation, which includes free text search, surveys, task-based online platforms like Mechanical Turk and Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, and tools for generating specialized knowledge graphs. Secondly, we explore the various approaches taken by clinicians to gather data through surveying patients, conducting interviews, or using other forms of feedback. Thirdly, we highlight the variety of natural language processing tasks involved in analyzing responses to structured medical questions. Fourthly, we present several machine learning algorithms that are commonly used to address the problem of crowdsourced medical consultation, including clustering algorithms, neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines. Finally, we review the various evaluation metrics used to measure the quality and utility of crowdsourced solutions. Our objective is to provide insights into the emerging technology landscape for personalized medical consultation, identify critical research gaps and opportunities, and inspire new ideas for developing crowdsourced solutions in medicine.

Personalized medical consultation involves tailoring treatment plans based on individual needs, preferences, and risk factors. To accomplish this, healthcare providers typically rely on external consultants who specialize in certain areas of expertise, either individually or in teams. Traditional models of medical consultation involve large amounts of time and resources dedicated solely towards coordinating multiple interdisciplinary professionals working together under close supervision. Crowdsourced solutions offer a cost-effective alternative, whereby doctors seek out experts on the internet, without requiring extensive training or resources. They are especially useful when it comes to handling highly diverse sets of patients, each with unique requirements and difficulties. Despite their promises, however, few empirical studies have been performed on the feasibility of implementing crowdsourced medical consultation programs, particularly focused on challenging topics such as diagnosis and treatment selection. This has led to a dearth of evidence regarding the efficacy of crowdsourced solutions in improving patient outcomes, enabling better clinical decision making, and enabling more accurate diagnoses and treatments.

Therefore, our goal is to develop an integrated framework that considers the key characteristics of crowdsourced medical consultation, including varying types of input data, computational processes, and output metrics, while also considering practical considerations such as clinician involvement, privacy concerns, ethical considerations, and social impacts. Based on a thorough examination of existing literature, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the field and identify promising directions for future research. Specifically, we want to provide a thorough understanding of the following issues:

1. Data Sources Used by Clinicians: How does each type of input data source affect the accuracy of crowdsourced solutions? What factors influence the choice of data source for a specific use case?

2. Techniques Used for Creating Questionnaires: Research has shown that non-structured formats like emails, texts, and phone calls can still be effective at collecting valuable information about patients. What are some strategies that clinicians may use to create questionnaires designed specifically for crowdsourcing? Is there any overlap between crowdsourcing and surveys, and should they be combined in order to maximize data collection efficiency?

3. Machine Learning Algorithms Used for Answering Questions: Although machine learning algorithms play a crucial role in artificial intelligence, less is known about the strengths and limitations of different algorithms used for addressing the problem of crowdsourced medical consultation. Can we detect bias in the answers provided by crowd workers to ensure fairness? Are there any techniques that can effectively handle situations where noisy data exists?

4. Evaluation Metrics Used to Assess Quality and Utility: Understanding the performance of crowdsourced solutions requires evaluating them against standardized criteria. While standards already exist for assessing traditional medical practice, what are the specific measures that need to be considered for crowdsourced systems? Should they take into account things like engagement rates, completion times, and payment mechanisms?
