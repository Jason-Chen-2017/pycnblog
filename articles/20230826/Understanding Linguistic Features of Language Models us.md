Transformers are powerful language models that have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, text classification, and question answering. However, it is not clear how these language models process linguistic features and their interactions with each other or the surrounding context. In this paper, we propose a methodology for analyzing linguistic features of transformer-based language models by observing their behavior in diverse scenarios including zero-shot inference, fine-tuning, generation, and explanation. We show that transformers learn to predict the distributional representation of words based on their syntactic properties, negation status, and contextual information in different languages. Based on our analysis, we identify several interesting linguistic phenomena that are particularly important for language understanding and generation beyond traditional n-gram models. Overall, our work sheds light on the fundamental differences between traditional language modeling techniques and the latest advancements made possible through neural networks. 

In this article, we first describe the background and key concepts related to language modeling, then proceed to explain the core algorithmic principles and details of transformer-based language models. Finally, we present an extensive set of experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of the proposed technique for understanding linguistic features of transformer-based language models. The hope is that this work will inspire further research into better utilizing the strengths of transformer-based language models while also fostering new directions in designing effective and transparent NLP systems. 

This article targets readers at all levels of technical expertise from junior graduates to senior data scientists who want to understand the inner workings of transformer-based language models and improve the way they process input text for natural language understanding and generation tasks. It can be read as both a technical overview and an interactive tutorial for practical use cases. 

2. Background and Key Concepts
## Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the ability of computers to understand and generate human language naturally. It involves a wide range of subfields such as speech recognition, natural language understanding, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and chatbots. A common approach towards solving complex NLP problems is to build deep learning models that map inputs to outputs. This includes feedforward neural networks (FNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and transformer-based language models. These models typically consist of multiple layers of processing units that take in sequences of tokens representing input text and produce corresponding probability distributions over output vocabulary. 

### Tokenization
Tokenization is the task of splitting raw text into smaller manageable chunks called tokens. Tokens could be individual words, phrases, or characters depending on the level of granularity required for the downstream model. Commonly used tokenizers include white space tokenizer, sentencepiece tokenizer, and wordpiece tokenizer. Each tokenizer has its own advantages and disadvantages, but most of them follow simple rules like treating whitespace as delimiter, discarding punctuation marks, and collapsing alphanumeric strings together. 

One advantage of character-level tokenization is that it preserves the original meaning of the text, which may be useful for certain applications such as handwriting recognition. For example, "A" would likely be represented as distinct symbols instead of being combined with "B". On the other hand, word-level tokenization often improves accuracy due to less ambiguity and better handling of compound nouns and verbs. Another downside of character-level tokenization is the computational complexity involved in training the model because larger sequences require more memory and computation resources. Therefore, there is a trade-off between the two approaches when deciding the right level of granularity.

### Vocabulary and Embeddings
The goal of building a language model is to assign a numerical vector representation to each unique word in the corpus. These vectors represent the semantics and syntax of the words within a given context. Word embeddings capture semantic relationships between words, allowing the model to capture non-local dependencies between words and to infer similarities even across different contexts. Two popular types of word embeddings are word2vec and GloVe. Both methods train a dense vector representation for each word in the vocabulary based on co-occurrence statistics and a fixed-size embedding matrix. Although each type of embedding captures some form of linguistic knowledge, they differ in terms of their capacity to encode long-term dependencies and domain-specific information. Moreover, standard word embeddings trained on large datasets struggle to capture idiomatic expressions, polysemy, and rare words without significant finetuning. 

### Language Modeling
Language modeling is the task of estimating the probability of generating a sequence of words conditioned on a preceding context. One popular approach is to estimate the likelihood of the next word given the previous sequence of words using a statistical language model such as n-gram or hidden markov model (HMM). While these models provide accurate predictions in many cases, they cannot handle variable length sequences, correlations between adjacent elements, or missing values. To address these issues, transformers-based language models replace HMMs with attention mechanisms and combine multiple representations of the same word to account for longer term dependencies. 

### Attention Mechanisms
Attention mechanisms are central to transformer-based language models, enabling them to consider multiple elements of the input sequence during prediction and to focus on relevant parts of the sequence to make better decisions. The attention mechanism consists of three components: query, key, and value vectors that are learned by the model. Query represents the current element of the sequence, key represents the history of the sequence up to that point, and value represents the encoded representation of each element of the sequence. The attention score is computed as the dot product between the query vector and the projection of the key vector onto a single dimension. Higher scores indicate greater importance and attention, while lower scores indicate lesser importance or irrelevance. The weight assigned to each element depends on its position relative to the others, making the attention mechanism capable of capturing global and local dependencies.

### Transformer-Based Language Models
Transformer-based language models leverage self-attention mechanisms to encode the entire input sequence into a fixed-dimensional representation, resulting in significantly improved performance compared to conventional language models. They operate under the principle of attention is all you need, requiring only fixed sized lookups and linear operations to compute the output logits. The architecture of the transformer consists of encoder blocks and decoder blocks that share parameters. Encoder blocks apply multi-head attention followed by layer normalization, dropout, and residual connections to compress the input sequence before passing it to the decoder block. Similarly, decoder blocks attend to the encoder output and combine it with the cross-attention layer if necessary, followed by another multi-head attention layer and another residual connection before computing the final output logit distribution. Despite their simplicity, transformer-based language models outperform classical language models on many benchmarks and achieve near-human level performance on language tasks involving long-range dependencies.

3. Core Algorithmic Principles and Details
Now let's explore the core algorithmic principles and details of transformer-based language models. Before moving forward, let me define some additional terminologies and notation that I'll refer to throughout the rest of this section.

Before we begin exploring the core algorithms, let us briefly recall what language models do in practice. As mentioned earlier, language models aim to estimate the probability of generating a sequence of words conditioned on a preceding context. Let $\mathcal{P}(w_t | w_{<t})$ denote the conditional probability of the $t$-th word in the generated sequence given the context consisting of the previously generated words ($w_{<t}$). If we assume that the context does not depend on the future, i.e., $\forall t', P(w_{>t'}|w_{<t}) = P(w_{>t'}\mid w_{<t})$, then the joint probability distribution of the whole sequence can be expressed as follows:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{P}(w_1,\dots,w_T & \mid w_{<1}, \dots, w_{<T-1}) \\
&= \prod_{t=1}^T \mathcal{P}(w_t | w_{<t}).
\end{aligned}
$$
To evaluate the quality of the language model, we can measure perplexity, defined as the exponential of negative log-likelihood:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\textrm{perplexity}(w_{<T}) &= 2^{-\frac{1}{NT} \sum_{t=1}^T \log_2[\mathcal{P}(w_t|\hat{w}_{<t})]}, \\
&\approx \exp(-\frac{1}{NT} \sum_{t=1}^T \log_2[\mathcal{P}(w_t|\hat{w}_{<t})]).
\end{aligned}
$$
where $\hat{w}_{<t}$ denotes the predicted word at step $t$. Perplexity measures the average reduction in entropy per word, hence higher values correspond to better models. 

To generate text, we can start with an initial seed word or phrase and iteratively select the word or phrase with highest probability given the previously generated words until we reach a stopping criterion or hit the maximum number of words. There exist several strategies for selecting the next word, ranging from pure random selection to greedy decoding that always selects the word that maximizes the expected increase in probability. Popular variants of beam search involve keeping track of the top-$k$ hypotheses at each step and extending them one at a time, pruning the least probable ones after each iteration. 

Finally, the transformer-based language model extends language models by incorporating attention mechanisms and addressing some shortcomings of existing architectures. Specifically, transformer-based language models enable parallel computations across multiple heads and layers, avoid the quadratic computation cost of RNNs by relying solely on attention mechanisms, and allow dynamic inference by expanding the input sequence on-the-fly rather than using a fixed window size. These benefits come at the cost of increased memory usage and slower training times.
