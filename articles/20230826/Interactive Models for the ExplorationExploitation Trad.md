# 1.简介
  

In Reinforcement Learning (RL), an agent learns to maximize its long term reward through trial and error interactions with the environment. However, how does the agent decide which actions to take at each step? In this article we will explore different interactive models that are used in RL to solve this exploration-exploitation tradeoff. We start by introducing the two most common types of models, namely, Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound, and then move on to discuss several other models and their applications. Finally, we present a summary of these models along with future research directions.

The following is a brief introduction to related concepts and terminology:

 - **Exploration**: This refers to the process where the agent explores new actions or policies that may lead to better rewards than those it has already experienced. It enables the agent to learn more about the environment and to find the optimal strategy to maximise cumulative reward over time. 

 - **Exploitation**: Exploiting the knowledge gained from earlier trials can help the agent avoid unnecessary trial-and-error efforts. By using knowledge derived from previous experience, the agent can quickly converge towards an optimal policy.

 - **Bandit Problem**: A simplified problem where the aim is to obtain maximum rewards by pulling a specific arm multiple times. The bandits have binary outcomes, either success or failure.

 - **Contextual Bandits**: Contextual bandits are similar to traditional multi-armed bandit problems but include additional information such as user preferences, current location, device settings etc., that can influence the behavior of the agent. They offer a solution that allows the agent to adapt to changing contexts and provide personalized recommendations.
 
 - **Interactive Model**: An algorithmic model that predicts the expected reward or value of taking certain actions based on previous observations made by the agent. The predictions are generated using machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees or neural networks. 
 
 - **Thompson Sampling**: This model uses Bayesian inference techniques to select the action with the highest probability of being the best option according to the agent’s beliefs. The probabilities are estimated based on the observed results of previous actions taken by the agent.

 - **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**: This model also estimates the expected reward for each action based on past data. Unlike Thompson sampling, UCB takes into account the uncertainty associated with each prediction, hence giving more weight to the uncertain options.

 - **Off-Policy**: Off-policy methods use a different target policy instead of the behavior policy for estimating the expected return. The main advantage of off-policy methods is that they do not require retraining after every update to the policy, thus reducing training time.
 
# 3.Thompson Sampling
## 3.1 Introduction
Thompson Sampling is one of the first exploratory models developed for reinforcement learning. It belongs to the class of contextual bandits models and works by modeling the distribution of the expected reward for each action given different sets of context variables. The basic idea behind Thompson Sampling is to choose the action with the largest expected reward at each iteration based on the posterior distributions of the parameters characterizing the underlying probability distributions. The main objective of the algorithm is to balance exploration and exploitation during the learning process. 

## 3.2 Algorithm
### Preliminaries
Let $A$ be the set of possible actions and let $\theta_a\subset R^d_{++}$ denote the parameter vector corresponding to action $a$. We assume that the reward function $r(x,\theta)$ depends only on the state variable $x$, while the context vectors $z=\{z_i\}_{i=1}^n$ contain information relevant to the interaction between the agent and the environment. For simplicity, we consider the case where there is only one context variable $z$ per action, i.e., $n=1$. Let $(X,Y,Z)=\{x^{(t)},y^{(t)},z^{(t)}\}_{t=1}^{T}$ be a dataset obtained by running the agent in an MDP with initial state $x_0$. The goal is to estimate the joint distribution $p_{\theta}(x, z, y \mid A)$.

### Algorithm Steps
  1. Initialize all parameters randomly: $\theta_a = (\theta_{a,1}, \dots, \theta_{a,d})$
  
  2. At each time step t:
   
      - Generate sample from prior distribution for each action a: $x_a ~ p(\theta_a)$
      
	  - Observe outcome x and reward r: $y^{(t)} = r(x^{(t)}; \theta^{*}_a)$
	  
	  	- If outcome is terminal, reset all parameters and repeat step 2
		  
  	  - Update parameters for action a: 
	  	
	    	$$\theta_a = \theta_a + \eta (r(x^{(t)}; \theta^{*}_a) - r(x_a;\theta_a)) X^T z^{(t)}$$
	  
	    - Set tau equal to the inverse temperature hyperparameter, usually chosen to be smaller than 1: $$\tau = 1/K$$
		
	  3. Choose action a with largest upper confidence bound based on current posterior distribution:
	   
	      $$a^{\star} = \arg\max_{a}\mu_a(x,z)$$
	      
	        - Where $\mu_a(x,z) := E[r(x; \theta_a)] + \sqrt{\frac{\ln T}{N_a(x,z)}}$
	
	        	    - $T$ is the total number of iterations so far

	    	        - $N_a(x,z)$ is the number of times action $a$ was selected in state $x$ with context $z$ before

	    	        - $K$ is the upper limit on the number of arms to consider
			
	         - Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence of estimation is achieved.
	         
	         - Return final parameter values $\theta_a$.
          
## 3.3 Practical Considerations
Thompson Sampling is computationally efficient since it requires only one pass over the entire dataset for updating the parameters. On the other hand, Thompson Sampling suffers from high variance because it is dependent on the quality of the initial choice of parameters. Therefore, it is important to carefully tune the hyperparameters such as the inverse temperature $\tau$ and the prior distributions to ensure good performance. In practice, Thompson Sampling has been found to perform well across many benchmark tasks including several variants of classic control problems like gridworld, coin flipping, mountain car and robot navigation. Nevertheless, there exist some limitations of Thompson Sampling, specifically when dealing with non-stationary environments, continuous action spaces and sparse feedback signals.

# 4. Upper Confidence Bound
## 4.1 Introduction
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) is another commonly used contextual bandit model that aims to balance exploration and exploitation during the learning process. It extends the concept of Thompson Sampling by incorporating a degree of uncertainty in the predicted reward. The basic principle behind UCB is to select the action that has the highest expected reward plus a bonus for having some confidence in the selection. Specifically, the bonus comes from estimating the standard deviation of the predicted reward for each action, which gives us some sense of how confident we should be in our decision. In contrast, Thompson Sampling simply selects the action with the highest expected reward without considering any uncertainty in the predictions. The key difference lies in the way the bonus is computed. While Thompson Sampling assumes that the predictions follow normal distributions, UCB computes the standard deviation directly. 

## 4.2 Algorithm
### Preliminaries
Let $A$ be the set of possible actions and let $\theta_a\subset R^d_{++}$ denote the parameter vector corresponding to action $a$. We assume that the reward function $r(x,\theta)$ depends only on the state variable $x$, while the context vectors $z=\{z_i\}_{i=1}^n$ contain information relevant to the interaction between the agent and the environment. For simplicity, we consider the case where there is only one context variable $z$ per action, i.e., $n=1$. Let $(X,Y,Z)=\{x^{(t)},y^{(t)},z^{(t)}\}_{t=1}^{T}$ be a dataset obtained by running the agent in an MDP with initial state $x_0$. The goal is to estimate the joint distribution $p_{\theta}(x, z, y \mid A)$.

### Algorithm Steps
  1. Initialize all parameters randomly: $\theta_a = (\theta_{a,1}, \dots, \theta_{a,d})$
  
  2. At each time step t:
   
      - Generate sample from prior distribution for each action a: $x_a ~ p(\theta_a)$
      
	  - Observe outcome x and reward r: $y^{(t)} = r(x^{(t)}; \theta^{*}_a)$
	  
	  	- If outcome is terminal, reset all parameters and repeat step 2
		  
  	  - Update parameters for action a: 
	  	
	    	$$\theta_a = \theta_a + \eta (r(x^{(t)}; \theta^{*}_a) - r(x_a;\theta_a)) X^T z^{(t)}$$
	  
	    - Estimate mean and variance for action a:
	  
	    	$$m_a(x) = \hat{q}_a(x; \theta_a)$$
	    	
	    	$$\sigma^2_a(x) = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^n [I(x_i = x) + \epsilon]}$$
	    	
	    	      - $\epsilon > 0$ is a small positive constant to prevent division by zero

	            - $I(x_i = x)$ is an indicator function that returns 1 if $x_i = x$ else 0

			    - $\hat{q}_a(x; \theta_a)$ is the predicted expected reward under action $a$ in state $x$

	          - Set tau equal to the inverse temperature hyperparameter, usually chosen to be larger than 1: $$\tau = c \log n$$
				
			  - Here, $c$ is a hyperparameter that determines how quickly the exploration bonus decreases
			  - and $n$ is the total number of actions considered
			  
		   - Set K equal to the number of arms to consider:
			 
			  $$K = |\mathcal{A}|$$
			  
			    - $\mathcal{A}$ is the set of allowed actions
			    
		   3. Choose action a with highest upper confidence bound based on current posterior distribution:
	   
	      $$a^{\star} = \arg\max_{a} Q_a(x)$$
	        - Where $Q_a(x) := m_a(x) + \sqrt{\frac{\tau}{N_a(x)}}\sqrt{\frac{v_a(x)}{N_a(x)}}$

	        - And compute the exploration bonus: 
	            
	            $$b(x) = \sqrt{\frac{\ln N}{N_a(x)}}$$

	        - And chose action with the highest upper confidence bound:  
	            
	            $$a^{\star} = \arg\max_{a} Q_a(x) + b(x)$$
					
		        - Here, $\ln N$ is the total number of samples seen so far and $N_a(x)$ is the number of times action $a$ has been sampled in state $x$.
		    
       	   - Repeat steps 2-3 until convergence of estimation is achieved.
         
         - Return final parameter values $\theta_a$. 
          
## 4.3 Practical Considerations
Similar to Thompson Sampling, UCB is computationally efficient due to its low variance compared to Thompson Sampling. As mentioned earlier, the quality of the initial choice of parameters plays a crucial role in achieving good performance. Additionally, the exploration bonus encourages exploration of unknown regions of the parameter space and can reduce the need for early stopping criteria that depend on local optima. Despite these advantages, UCB still struggles with limited sample efficiency and does not scale well to large numbers of actions. Overall, although UCB is simple to understand and implement, its performance is competitive with Thompson Sampling for some tasks, especially in terms of regret. Nonetheless, further improvements can be made to improve both algorithms' ability to handle sparse feedback signals and non-stationary environments.
