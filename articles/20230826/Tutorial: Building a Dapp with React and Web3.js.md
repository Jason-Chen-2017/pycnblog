# 1.简介
  

Web3.js是一个开源项目，基于JavaScript语言，它允许开发者通过浏览器或者Node.js环境构建基于区块链的应用程序(dapps)。本教程将会展示如何用React框架搭建一个简单的dapp，基于Metamask钱包进行用户身份认证并连接到我们的合约账户中。这个合约账户将用来存储和更新个人信息，包括用户名、邮箱地址和加密密码。
# 2.关键词：React, Web3.js, Metamask, Ethereum Smart Contract, Blockchain dapp
# 3.目标读者
- 有一定编程基础（熟悉HTML，CSS，JavaScript）；
- 有npm或yarn管理工具的经验；
- 对Solidity编程语言有基本了解。

本教程共分为9个部分，主要阐述如下：

## Part 1: Overview of the tutorial
Introduction to blockchain and web3 concepts, terminologies and technologies used in this project.

## Part 2: Setting up development environment
Installing Node.js, npm or yarn package manager, Truffle framework for developing smart contracts, Ganache UI application for testing smart contract locally, and Metamask browser extension for interacting with our dapp on local network. 

## Part 3: Creating a simple dapp using React and Web3.js
Creating an empty React app with create-react-app command line tool and installing required dependencies such as react-web3 and ethers library for interacting with web3 wallets and EVM-based blockchains like Ethereum, Polygon (Matic Network), etc.

## Part 4: Connecting users to Metamask wallet through MetaMask API integration
Configuring MetaMask extension for our dapp to allow user authentication through wallet connection. We will also implement functionality to connect to a deployed contract account which is required to store and update personal information.

## Part 5: Writing Solidity code for storing and updating personal data
Implementing the necessary functions to write and read from a personal data storage smart contract based on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) technology. The Solidity programming language will be introduced and explained step by step while creating a simple smart contract that stores username, email address, encrypted password, and other related data for each registered user.

## Part 6: Compiling and deploying the smart contract on Rinkeby testnet
Deploying the compiled smart contract onto the Rinkeby testnet using Infura's API integration. This process involves generating a new wallet address and importing it into MetaMask so we can interact with the contract account created earlier.

## Part 7: Integrating front-end components with the smart contract
Building input fields and buttons in the React app for entering personal data and triggering contract transactions through MetaMask plugin APIs.

## Part 8: Adding more features and customizing the look and feel of our dapp
Enhancements to the existing functionalities and design elements to make our dapp more engaging and intuitive for end users.

## Part 9: Conclusion and future directions
A summary of all the steps taken throughout the tutorial and tips and tricks for further improvements to enhance user experience and security. Future additions may include integrating payment processing services, adding social media login/signup capabilities, and providing additional features like resetting passwords and multi-factor authentication options via SMS verification.
