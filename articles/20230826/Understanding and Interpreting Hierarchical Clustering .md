Hierarchical clustering is a popular data mining technique used to group similar objects into clusters. It works by iteratively merging pairs of clusters that are most similar at each step until all the objects have been assigned to exactly one cluster. This article will introduce hierarchical clustering and explain how it works using an example problem. We will also see how hierarchical clustering trees can be interpreted to reveal meaningful insights about the underlying structure of the dataset. Finally, we will explore various implementations of hierarchical clustering algorithms in Python and identify their strengths and limitations for solving different problems with real-world datasets.

The following sections should be included in the final version:

1 Introduction: introduces the concept of hierarchical clustering and its application in data science.
2 Basic Concepts and Terminology: defines important terms such as distance matrix, linkage method, dendrogram and clusering tree. Also, briefly discusses k-means clustering algorithm.
3 Dendrograms: explains what a dendrogram represents and presents its mathematical formulation. Presents examples on how dendrograms are created from linkage matrices or clusterings obtained via k-means clustering algorithm. Explains how dendrograms can help us interpret clustering results.
4 Linkage Methods: provides a detailed explanation of six commonly used linkage methods - single, complete, average, centroid, median, and ward. Discusses when they are suitable for use and describes their mathematical formulations.
5 Implementation: demonstrates how to implement six common hierarchical clustering algorithms, including AgglomerativeClustering (average linkage), DBSCAN (density based spatial clustering of applications with noise) and Affinity Propagation (partitional affinity propagation). The code uses sample data sets provided by scikit-learn library and includes comments explaining the steps taken during computation.
6 Application: explores the relationship between the choice of linkage method and the resulting clustering tree. Introduces four real world case studies to illustrate how different linkage methods result in different clustering structures and insights.
7 Conclusion: draws conclusions and outlines future research directions related to hierarchical clustering techniques. Identifies areas where improvements can be made and suggests ways in which current approaches could be improved to provide better solutions for practical data analysis tasks.
Overall, this article aims to provide a thorough understanding of the hierarchical clustering process and its role in data exploration and visualization. By presenting numerous examples and explanations, we hope to make it accessible to non-technical readers and enable them to gain valuable insights into their own data sets. Finally, we hope to encourage other researchers to contribute to the field by providing more comprehensive resources and tools that allow users to implement and apply these techniques to their own data sets.
