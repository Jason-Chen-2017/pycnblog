Text analytics refers to the process of deriving insights from unstructured text data using computational methods such as natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and deep learning. This field has grown rapidly over the last decade due to advances in NLP techniques and growing availability of large-scale datasets that can be used for training models. In this article, we will discuss three popular NLP tasks - sentiment analysis, topic modelling, and named entity recognition (NER). We will use a high-level deep learning framework called MXNet to implement these algorithms on real world text datasets. Finally, we will provide an evaluation of each algorithm's performance based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score etc. All code examples in this blog post are available at https://github.com/mli/mxnet_text_analytics.

Sentiment analysis is the task of classifying whether a piece of text expresses positive or negative emotional sentiments towards some underlying subject. It involves analyzing the context of words, phrases and sentences within a given text and inferring its overall tone. The goal is to determine if the reader feels positive, negative, or neutral about the content being discussed. For example, when customers review a product online, it could be useful to identify their opinions and their reactions towards it. Similarly, while monitoring social media platforms, it becomes essential to identify trending topics and analyse the emotions expressed by users around them. 

Topic modeling aims to discover latent topics present in a collection of documents. These topics capture semantic relationships between different parts of the document and can help in understanding what the document is about. When applied to customer reviews, this technique can help in understanding the types of products that customers are rating positively and those who may have received negative feedback. Additionally, during legal cases, lawyers often seek to organize and categorize various materials related to specific issues into structured categories. This enables efficient management of the case files.

Named entity recognition (NER) is another crucial aspect of NLP that identifies and classifies predefined entities mentioned in the text into pre-defined classes such as person names, organizations, locations, dates, times, and quantities. Within the scope of this article, we will focus solely on English texts, but other languages like German, Spanish, French, etc., also benefit significantly from these techniques. 

In conclusion, text analytics offers several powerful tools for extracting valuable insights from vast amounts of unstructured data such as social media posts, customer feedback, research papers, lawsuits, and more. Using cutting edge machine learning and deep learning frameworks such as MXNet, we can build robust and accurate models for performing complex NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and named entity recognition efficiently and accurately. By leveraging large-scale text corpora and cloud computing resources, we can scale up our solutions to handle large volumes of unstructured data effectively. Therefore, it is important to keep abreast of the latest developments in NLP and adopt best practices for building scalable and reliable systems.

Before diving into the technical details, let’s briefly cover some fundamental concepts and terminology. 

2.1 Corpus

A corpus is a collection of raw text data gathered from various sources such as web pages, emails, blogs, etc. A typical workflow would involve cleaning the data, converting it into a standard format, and then tokenizing it into individual units such as words, punctuation marks, and numbers. Once all the tokens are generated, they need to be analyzed further to perform downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and named entity recognition.

2.2 Tokens

Tokens are the basic unit of analysis in natural language processing where each word, phrase, number, and symbol in a sentence is treated as a separate item. Words are broken down into smaller subwords or ngrams before being fed into a model. There are many ways to tokenize text including rule-based methods, stemming, lemmatization, and part-of-speech tagging. Tokenization is essential because it helps us understand the meaning and structure of the text better.

2.3 Vocabulary and Vector Representation

Vocabulary represents the set of unique words in the dataset along with their corresponding integer indices. Each integer index represents one feature vector representing the presence or absence of a particular word in the document. The length of the vector corresponds to the size of the vocabulary, which makes the vector space dense. Vector representation allows us to represent text in numerical form, making it easier for us to compare and analyze the text data.

2.4 Embedding

Embedding is a technique used to convert discrete features such as words, characters, or tags into continuous vectors of fixed dimensionality. In NLP, embeddings are generally learned jointly with the rest of the neural network architecture. The idea behind embedding is that similar words should be mapped to nearby points in the vector space while dissimilar words should be mapped far away from each other. By doing so, we learn abstract representations of the input data that reflect the semantic relationships between different elements of the text. Embeddings are usually learned using either simple matrix factorization or neural networks.

2.5 Bag of Words Model

Bag of words is a very simple approach to extract features from text data. Here, we simply count the occurrence of each distinct term in the document without considering any order or grammar. One common way to create a bag of words representation is to assign weights to each word depending on its frequency in the document. Another method is to use TF-IDF weighting scheme, which takes into account both the frequency and inverse document frequency of each word.
