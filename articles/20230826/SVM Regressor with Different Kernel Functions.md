# 2.背景介绍
In recent years, support vector machines have become one of the most commonly used algorithms in supervised machine learning tasks such as classification and regression analysis. One of the main reasons why they are so popular is their ability to handle high-dimensional datasets while retaining good generalization performance. However, it can be challenging to find the best hyperparameters that balance between complexity and generalization performance for a particular dataset. Therefore, an alternative approach to finding optimal parameters is to use optimization techniques such as grid search or randomized search. Nevertheless, optimizing hyperparameters becomes computationally expensive when dealing with large datasets. A more efficient way to optimize hyperparameters is through Bayesian optimization, which combines the advantages of both grid search and optimization by exploring regions of parameter space that are likely to produce better results. 

However, in practice, selecting the right kernel function is a crucial step towards building accurate models. Kernel functions define the similarity between data points in terms of their feature values rather than their location on a specific dimension. Traditionally, two commonly used kernel functions are linear and polynomial. Linear kernel function calculates the dot product of input vectors. Polynomial kernel function uses a higher degree polynomial transformation of input features instead of just simple multiplication. It has many practical applications such as text categorization, image processing, and bioinformatics where non-linear relationships exist among variables. Nonetheless, there may not always be a clear choice between these two kernel functions.

In addition, traditional SVMs only work well on separable datasets like two classes of objects with clear boundaries between them. This is because they assume that if there exists a decision boundary between two classes, then all other points should also fall into the same category according to the margin criterion. However, real world datasets often contain complex patterns and irregular shapes, making them difficult to separate into clear categories. To address this issue, a new class of methods called support vector machines (SVMs) with kernel trick have been proposed. These methods map inputs into a high-dimensional space, enabling nonlinear classification and regression. 


To summarize, the goal of our project is to create a tutorial that demonstrates how to build an SVM regressor model using different kernel functions in Python. We hope that this post helps developers understand the basics of SVM and its implementation. If you encounter any errors or omissions, please do let us know! You can contact us at <EMAIL>.

# 3.基本概念术语说明
Before diving into the core details of the project, here are some basic concepts and terminology that need to be known beforehand:

1. Support Vector Machine (SVM): An algorithm that forms a hyperplane between labeled training instances to maximize the margins of the instances. Can be used for both classification and regression problems.

2. Hyperplane: A flat surface that passes through a subset of the vector space. For instance, a plane in three dimensions can be thought of as a hyperplane passing through each point of the three-dimensional space.

3. Margin: The perpendicular distance from the hyperplane to the closest instance within the same class.

4. Lagrange Multipliers: Used to solve constrained optimization problems related to SVM. A scalar value assigned to each constraint that determines how much each term contributes to the objective function's minimum.

5. Dual Problem: The problem of maximizing the margin subject to the constraints of the primal problem being equal to minimizing the corresponding slack variable in the dual formulation of SVM.

6. Slack Variable: Extra free variables introduced to allow violations of the constraints imposed by the primal problem but that do not contribute significantly to the solution. They serve as a backup plan in case the gradients of the primal problem become too small.

7. Loss Function: Represents the error made during prediction, measured in the same units as the target variable(s). Common loss functions include Hinge Loss, Squared Error, and Absolute Error.

## 4.1 SVM Overview
The SVM algorithm works by searching for the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the positive and negative examples. When new examples arrive, the algorithm assigns them to the side of the hyperplane that maximizes their distance to the hyperplane. Positive examples are those that lie above the hyperplane, whereas negative ones are below. Thus, SVM aims to identify the most important features that distinguish between positive and negative examples and minimize the margin between them.

Given a set of labeled training examples $(x_i, y_i), i=1,...,N$ where $x_i\in \mathcal{X}$ and $y_i \in \{-1, +1\}$, the SVM problem can be stated as follows:

$$\text{Maximize}\quad \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_i}{\|W\|} - \sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_i [y_i(\langle x_i, W\rangle+b)-1]$$

subject to $\begin{cases}0\leq\alpha_i\leq C,~\forall~i\\ \sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_iy_i = 0 \\ W^TW=I_d\end{cases}$. Here, $\alpha_i$ are the lagrange multipliers, $C$ is a regularization parameter, $W$ is the weight matrix, $b$ is the bias term, and $d$ is the number of features in the input $x$. The first term represents the fraction of the margin that the classifier wants to cover. The second term penalizes misclassifications, with larger penalty for mistakes on the wrong side of the hyperplane. Finally, the third condition restricts the weights to be unit length to ensure that all inputs are given equal importance regardless of their magnitude.

To convert this problem into a standard quadratic programming (QP) problem, we introduce slack variables $\xi_i$, which measure how far the observation $x_i$ is from violating the constraints of the problem. Then, we replace the constraint $\alpha_i \geqslant 0$ with $\xi_i-\alpha_i \geqslant 0$ and substitute $y_i (\langle x_i, W\rangle+b)$ with $\frac{\langle x_i, W\rangle+b}{||W||}_2$. Finally, we add additional constraints to enforce the positivity constraint on the weights $W$ and the norm constraint on the sum of alphas $\|W\|=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_i^2}$. Once we obtain the QP representation of the SVM problem, we can apply standard numerical optimization procedures to find the maximum margin hyperplane.

Once we have identified the hyperplane that maximizes the margin, we can make predictions about new unlabeled examples simply by computing the dot product of the example with the weight vector $W$ and adding the bias term $b$. We can choose between the hard margin and soft margin versions of SVM depending on whether we want to classify the examples perfectly or give less weight to outliers. Additionally, we can tune the regularization parameter $C$ to control the tradeoff between keeping the margin wide enough to capture all the relevant information in the data and ensuring that we don't overfit the model to the noise.

## 4.2 Choosing the Right Kernel Function
Kernel functions play a crucial role in creating effective classifiers. A kernel function defines the similarity between data points based solely on their feature values without considering their spatial relationships. There are several types of kernels available, including radial basis functions (RBF), polynomial kernels, and sigmoid kernels. Each of these kernel functions gives rise to a different type of decision boundary that fits the underlying structure of the data. Depending on the nature of the problem at hand, choosing the appropriate kernel function may help improve the accuracy and interpretability of the model.

### Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel
The RBF kernel computes the euclidean distance between two points mapped onto a higher dimensional space where each dimension corresponds to the scaled difference between the original features. Specifically, for two points $x=(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)^T$ and $z=(z_1,z_2,\ldots,z_n)^T$, the RBF kernel is defined as:

$$K(x, z)=e^{-\gamma ||x-z||^2},$$

where $\gamma>0$ controls the width of the kernel. Intuitively, the width of the kernel controls the smoothness of the resulting decision boundary. As $\gamma$ tends to infinity, the kernel becomes equivalent to the identity function, representing a hard margin SVM. On the other hand, as $\gamma$ approaches zero, the kernel becomes piecewise constant, indicating a soft margin SVM that balances precision and recall tradeoffs.

### Polynomial Kernel
The polynomial kernel is similar to the RBF kernel in that it maps the input features onto a higher dimensional space. Instead of directly computing the Euclidean distance, however, it applies a transformation of the inputs that makes the distances look more Gaussian-like. Specifically, for two points $x=(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)^T$ and $z=(z_1,z_2,\ldots,z_n)^T$, the polynomial kernel is defined as:

$$K(x,z)=(\gamma \langle x,z\rangle+\delta)^d,$$

where $\gamma, \delta > 0$ are scaling and offset parameters, respectively, and $d$ is the degree of the polynomial. The degree of the polynomial specifies the amount of curvature that the decision boundary should exhibit. Higher degrees result in smoother boundaries, leading to a tradeoff between robustness and flexibility. Similarly, lower degrees lead to sharper boundaries that may not fit the underlying geometry of the data very well.

### Sigmoid Kernel
The sigmoid kernel was originally designed to map binary inputs into probabilities. Now, it is widely used in SVMs for non-binary outputs. Given two points $x=(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)^T$ and $z=(z_1,z_2,\ldots,z_n)^T$, the sigmoid kernel is defined as:

$$K(x,z)=tanh(\gamma \langle x,z\rangle+\delta),$$

where $\gamma, \delta > 0$ are scaling and offset parameters. Like the polynomial kernel, the sigmoid kernel allows us to apply transformations of the input features to get a more flexible decision boundary. Unlike the polynomial kernel, however, the sigmoid kernel does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality since the transformed features are continuous. Also, the range of the output values is [-1,1], which means that the decision boundary can take on both positive and negative slopes.

# 5.具体代码实现与说明
Now that we've learned the basic ideas behind SVM and its implementation, we'll demonstrate how to build an SVM regressor model using different kernel functions in Python. We'll start by importing the necessary libraries and generating sample data.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
from sklearn.svm import SVR
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

np.random.seed(42)
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=1, noise=20, random_state=42)
plt.scatter(X, y);
```


We'll now train three different SVM regressor models using the RBF, polynomial, and sigmoid kernel functions.

```python
rbf_svr = SVR(kernel='rbf', C=100, gamma=0.1) # rbf kernel
poly_svr = SVR(kernel='poly', C=100, gamma='auto') # polynomial kernel
sigmoid_svr = SVR(kernel='sigmoid', C=100, gamma='auto') # sigmoid kernel

rbf_svr.fit(X, y)
poly_svr.fit(X, y)
sigmoid_svr.fit(X, y)

rbf_predictions = rbf_svr.predict(X)
poly_predictions = poly_svr.predict(X)
sigmoid_predictions = sigmoid_svr.predict(X)

plt.scatter(X, y, label='data')
plt.plot(X, rbf_predictions, c='orange', label='RBF')
plt.plot(X, poly_predictions, c='blue', label='Polynomial')
plt.plot(X, sigmoid_predictions, c='green', label='Sigmoid')
plt.legend()
plt.show();
```


As we can see, the RBF kernel produces a straight line that fits the data reasonably well, while the polynomial kernel shows a wider curve and requires a smaller degree polynomial. Finally, the sigmoid kernel captures the non-linear relationship present in the data by producing a curved decision boundary. Overall, the choice of kernel function depends on the underlying pattern of the data and the desired level of flexibility required in the decision boundary.
