如今，互联网时代已经到来，人们对隐私权保护需求日益增长。随着人工智能、物联网等新兴技术的出现，越来越多的人开始利用个人数据用于各种各样的目的。作为互联网服务提供商，如何让用户在使用服务过程中知情地 consent 涉及他们个人信息的第三方使用和收集，是当前面临的一项关键性技术难题。虽然互联网用户对隐私权保护意识较强，但仍然存在不少违反该规则的案例，甚至被起诉或被跨国公司非法获取用户信息。本文将详细阐述We will never sell your information to third parties except under very limited circumstances 的原则。
# 2.核心概念
## 2.1 Who am I?
The term “we” in this document refers to SOOMLA Inc., a company established in March 2014 that provides a suite of services designed to make developing mobile games easy for developers and publishers alike. While most SOOMLA’s products are focused on game development, our core business is building an ecosystem of companies focused on supporting games across all genres and industries. One key component of this ecosystem is SOOMLA's use of data analytics technology. 

In particular, SOOMLA uses online behavioral analysis tools to better understand user preferences and behavior within their games. This type of analysis is particularly useful when it comes to designing new features, enhancing existing ones, and optimizing performance. To achieve this level of insight, we use various machine learning algorithms including clustering, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.

As part of our mission, SOOMLA also offers a wide range of marketing and advertisement services. These include paid search campaigns targeting specific audiences, social media advertising, email newsletters, and more. These activities often require us to gather large amounts of personal data about our customers, such as demographics, interests, behavior patterns, and interactions with different devices and platforms. However, by following the principles outlined below, we can ensure that we only collect necessary data while still protecting user privacy and security.

## 2.2 Why do you want me to consent?
To provide personalized content, games, and advertising, SOOMLA needs to collect certain types of data from its users. For example, if a player wants to receive push notifications from their favorite game developer, they must first give permission for us to contact them via SMS or phone call. Similarly, if a publisher would like to target their audience based on their past purchase history, then they may need to see some details about their payment information.

Sometimes, these permissions cannot be given automatically and must be granted manually by the players or publishers themselves. In order for us to serve these legitimate requests, we need to have accurate customer data and knowledge of how they use our platform. By providing transparency, we can inform players and publishers of what data we collect, why we collect it, and how we use it before granting any permissions.

Additionally, SOOMLA considers compliance with relevant laws and regulations when collecting personal data. If we believe it is necessary to obtain consent from a user for a specific purpose (such as marketing), then we may seek legal counsel or other measures required by law.

By keeping customer data confidential and compliant with applicable law, we can maintain control over the collection and use of personal data, ensuring that it remains private and secure throughout the game lifecycle.

## 2.3 What personal data do you collect and why?
SOOMLA currently collects the following types of personal data:

1. Demographic Information – Name, address, age, gender, education level, occupation, income, etc.
2. Device Information – IP Address, operating system version, device model, unique identifiers, etc.
3. Transaction Data – Purchase History, Payment Information, Usage Statistics, Referral Codes, etc.
4. Account Activity Logs - User actions and events on our website, SDKs, and APIs, including login attempts, account creation/deletion, password resets, and profile updates.
5. Marketing Preferences – Interest Categories, Product Favorites, Purchase History, Location Services, etc.

These types of data are collected through various sources, such as direct input by players and publishers, automated log file collection, partner integrations, and third-party service providers who provide additional data beyond what we collect ourselves. Specifically, SOOMLA relies heavily on third-party vendors and contractors who provide hosting services, technical support, customer relationship management, and customer feedback surveys. As a result, we cannot guarantee full anonymity when it comes to sensitive data, but we aim to minimize the risk of potential harm caused by sharing this information.

In summary, we take several steps to collect, store, process, and analyze personal data while maintaining appropriate levels of privacy protection and security. Within each of our products and services, we clearly define the purposes for which we collect and use personal data, and provide transparent information on how those data are used and shared. Finally, we work closely with our lawyers and related entities to ensure that our practices comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data handling.
