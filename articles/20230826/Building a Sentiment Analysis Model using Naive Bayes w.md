Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying and extracting subjective information from text data. In this article, we will implement a basic sentiment analysis model using Naive Bayes algorithm in Python language.

In order to understand what sentiment analysis is and why it's important for businesses or organizations, let’s consider an example: If you frequently read articles on Amazon or any e-commerce website, you might notice that sometimes they provide positive reviews about products, while others may be negative. This reflects the overall opinion towards the brand or product and can help make better decisions. Similarly, if you often browse social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram, chances are high that some posts have positive emotions such as love, happiness, and hope, while others express sadness, grief, and pity. By analyzing these opinions over time, businesses and organizations can make more informed business decisions, which ultimately leads to improved customer experience and profitability.

Now, coming back to our sentiment analysis task at hand, we need to develop a system capable of classifying new text into one of two categories - Positive or Negative. Our approach will be very simple yet effective - we will use the Naive Bayes algorithm to train a machine learning model based on a labeled dataset containing texts belonging to each category. The input to our classifier would be a sentence or a document, and its output would be either “Positive” or “Negative”. We will then evaluate the accuracy of our model by testing it against another dataset. Finally, we will deploy our sentiment analyzer into a web application or integrate it with other applications for real-time analysis. 

To achieve this task, we need to follow the following steps:

1. Understanding the Dataset
2. Preprocessing the Data
3. Training the Model
4. Testing the Model
5. Deploying the Model (Optional)
