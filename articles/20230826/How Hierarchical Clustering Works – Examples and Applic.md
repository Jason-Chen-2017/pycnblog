# 1.简介
  

Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that groups similar data points together into clusters based on their similarity or distance measures in a hierarchical manner. It helps identify relationships between variables by finding patterns within the dataset. The most commonly used algorithm for performing hierarchical clustering is the Agglomerative (bottom-up) approach. This article provides information about how this technique works, explains its basic concepts and terminology, demonstrates it using sample datasets, and discusses its potential applications in industry and research fields.

# 2. Background Introduction
Hierarchical clustering refers to a process of grouping similar objects or data points into subgroups or clusters based on some similarity measure such as Euclidean distance, correlation coefficient or cosine similarity. In order to perform hierarchical clustering, we first need to decide which similarity metric to use when comparing each pair of data points. Once we have decided on our similarity metric, we can start merging the nearest pairs of data points until all data points belong only to one cluster or the desired number of clusters are obtained. 

There are several advantages of hierarchical clustering over other clustering techniques:

1. Easy interpretation: Hierarchical clustering produces a dendrogram that shows the relationship between data points at different levels of hierarchy. This makes it easier to understand the structure of the data and make sense of any outliers or exceptions found during the clustering process.

2. Insensitivity to noise: Unlike k-means clustering where one random centroid is chosen as the starting point, hierarchical clustering starts with every data point in a separate cluster and merges them progressively. As a result, noisy data points do not affect the final clustering results. 

3. Flexibility: Since hierarchical clustering involves merging data points at multiple stages, various methods can be applied to define the cutting criteria at each step. These include minimum intercluster distance, maximum variance reduction, average linkage criterion, and others. 

4. Scalability: Hierarchical clustering can handle large amounts of data efficiently since it uses a bottom-up approach instead of a brute force search. Furthermore, parallel processing can also be used to speed up the computation time if needed.

However, there are drawbacks to hierarchical clustering as well:

1. Time complexity: Hierarchical clustering can be slow for very large datasets due to the fact that it involves merging thousands of data points at each level. However, faster algorithms exist to address this issue like DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), which performs density-based clustering instead of partitioning individual data points.

2. Interpretability: Hierarchical clustering does not provide clear-cut boundaries between the resulting clusters, making it difficult to determine what kind of pattern they represent. On the other hand, k-means clustering usually assigns distinct clusters because it takes into account both position and distribution of the data points.

3. Curse of dimensionality: Hierarchical clustering becomes less effective when the number of dimensions increases, i.e., when the number of features exceeds the number of samples. In such cases, other clustering techniques such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) may be more suitable.


In summary, while hierarchical clustering offers great flexibility, scalability, and interpretability, it has its own set of challenges like curse of dimensionality and slow performance for very large datasets. Overall, hierarchical clustering should serve as a valuable tool in many domains where exploratory analysis and pattern recognition are important tasks.

# 3. Basic Concepts & Terminology 
## Data Points
The term "data point" can refer to either an individual object or record being analyzed. For example, if we were analyzing sales data, each sale would correspond to a single data point. Similarly, if we were classifying documents, each document would correspond to a data point. Regardless of the specific definition used, the goal is always the same: group similar data points together so that we can gain insight from them. 

## Distance Measures
The choice of distance measure determines how similar two data points are defined. There are several common metrics used for measuring distances, including Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Minkowski distance, Pearson correlation coefficient, Cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity index, etc. Each metric has certain properties that make it suited for particular types of data sets and analysis requirements. For instance, Pearson correlation coefficient is typically used when working with continuous data such as numerical values. 

## Clusters
A cluster refers to a collection of data points that are thought to be similar according to the selected distance metric. At each stage of the hierarchical clustering process, the algorithm compares each pair of data points and identifies the closest ones. When two or more data points fall within a given threshold distance, they are said to form a new cluster. The size of a cluster depends on the specific application but could range from just two data points to millions or billions depending on the size of the input data. 

## Dendrograms
A dendrogram is a graphical representation of the hierarchical clustering process. Each branch of the tree corresponds to a merged cluster. The height of the branches represents the distance between the data points represented by those clusters. The vertical line connecting the root node to each leaf node indicates the final number of clusters formed after the entire process is complete. Dendrograms can help us interpret the structure of the data and identify any irregularities or outliers that might indicate deeper issues. 


# 4. Algorithm Overview
1. Begin by selecting one data point as the initial cluster center. 
2. Compute the distance between each remaining data point and the cluster center. Assign each data point to the cluster whose center is closest. 
3. Recalculate the center of each newly formed cluster. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all data points are assigned to exactly one cluster or the desired number of clusters are obtained. 

This process can be visualized using a dendrogram, which displays the relationships between data points and clusters throughout the clustering process. Each branch of the tree corresponds to a merged cluster. The length of the branches represents the distance between the data points represented by those clusters. The height of the branches decreases as the algorithm progresses through the hierarchy. 

To break down the steps involved in hierarchical clustering, let's take a look at the following image:


Here, we can see three data points labeled A, B, and C. We want to group these data points into three clusters based on their distance. Initially, we choose one data point, say A, as the cluster center. Next, we compute the distance between each remaining data point and A. Since C is closer to A than B, it belongs to cluster 1. Similarly, B is closer to A than C, so it belongs to cluster 2. Finally, we recompute the centers of cluster 1 and 2 and repeat the process until we have exactly three clusters or until we reach the specified stopping condition.

Once we have completed the clustering process, we will get something similar to the following dendrogram:


We can observe that the top two branches represent the initial two clusters containing A and B, respectively. After merging these two clusters, we obtain a third cluster containing C. From here, the process continues recursively until all data points are assigned to exactly one cluster or until we reach the desired number of clusters.
