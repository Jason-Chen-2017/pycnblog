# 1.简介
  

The information entropy formula (IEF) is one of the most commonly used formulas in statistical physics to calculate the entropy of a system or signal. It's widely used in many fields such as data compression, signal processing, pattern recognition, and machine learning. In this article we will present its basic concept, derivation and proofs for practical use cases. We'll also discuss how it relates to other commonly used measures such as mutual information and relative entropy. Finally, we'll show some examples of how it can be applied in different contexts such as image compression, music recommendation systems, natural language processing and text analysis.
# 2.Concepts and Terminology
Before understanding the IEF, let us first understand some important concepts:

1. Entropy: The entropy of a random variable X is defined as S = -∑(p_i * log_2 p_i), where i represents each possible outcome of X. 
2. Random Variable: A random variable is a function that assigns values to an event at random. For example, if we flip a coin then X could take on either value "heads" or "tails". If Y is the result of rolling two dice then Z could take any integer between 2 and 12 inclusive. All these variables are random.
3. Probability Distribution: A probability distribution is a mathematical model that describes the probabilities of outcomes of a random process. For instance, given the sequence "HTHHT", we may say that there is a higher chance of heads coming up than tails.

Now that we have a basic understanding of these concepts, let's proceed to derive the IEF.
# Derivation of the IEF
The IEF is derived from the fact that the entropy of a random variable is equal to the average information content of its individual parts. Let's consider a simple example. Suppose X is a fair six-sided die which has equal probabilities of all sides being rolled. Then the entropy of X would be:

 H(X) = -(1/6*log_2(1/6)) + (-1/6)*log_2(-1/6) +... + (-1/6)*log_2(-1/6)
        = log_2(6) / ln(6)
        
where the sum of negative terms comes from counting all possibilities of rolling each side twice, once in each face. Similarly, for another fair die with sides {1, 2}, H(Y) = log_2(3)/ln(3). These two dice have half the entropy of a fair six-sided die. Therefore, we know that the entropy of a composite random variable is always less than or equal to the entropy of its constituent parts. Thus, we obtain:

    H(XY) ≤ H(X) + H(Y)
    
This follows from the law of total entropy which states that the entropy of a joint probability distribution is the sum of entropies of its marginal distributions. Now, let's turn our attention towards deriving the exact formula for the entropy of independent random variables. Consider two binary random variables X and Y whose probabilities can be written as follows:
    
    P(X=x) = p
    P(Y=y|X=x) = q(x)     (for x=0 or x=1)
    
Here, p is the prior probability of X taking the value '1'. Given that X takes the value '1', the likelihood of observing the outcome Y is denoted by q(x). This means that if X equals '1' then Y can take on one of two values with corresponding probabilities q(0) and q(1). For both X and Y, assume that they have entropy H(X) and H(Y):
    
    H(X|Y) ≥ max[H(X), H(Y)]        [MPE condition]
    
    
To satisfy the MPE condition, we need to choose the value of X that minimizes the expected information gain. That is, we want to find the decision rule that selects the value of X based on the observed value of Y. One way to do this is to set 
    
    H(Y|X=x) = −q(x)log_2 q(x) + (1−q(x))*log_2(1−q(x))         [binary case]
    
Then the maximum entropy decision rule would select the class with highest information content (highest probability) irrespective of what value X takes. However, since we don't actually observe the value of Y, this approach cannot tell us about the true probabilities. Instead, we can modify the above equation using Bayes' rule:
    
    P(X=1|Y) = P(Y|X=1)P(X=1) / ∑_x P(Y|X=x)P(X=x)      [summation of conditional probabilities]
    
Using this expression, we can evaluate the entropy H(X) in terms of the conditional probabilities P(X=x) and P(Y|X=x):
    
    H(X) = Σ_x P(X=x) * H(X|X=x)                               [entropy of a single variable]
    
where H(X|X=x) refers to the entropy of X given its state X=x. Substituting this into the expression for H(X), we get:
    
    H(X) = pH(Y|X=1) + (1−p)H(Y|X=0)                           [combined entropy of two variables]
    
where p = P(X=1). Continuing further, we see that the entropy of the entire joint distribution can be expressed recursively as follows:
    
    H(X,Y) = H(X) + H(Y|X)                                     [conditional entropy]
    

For continuous random variables, the derivation is similar but more involved due to the presence of the normalizing constant required when computing the entropy of a mixture of probability distributions. Nevertheless, the general idea remains the same. The key insight here is that the entropy of a random variable is essentially the degree of uncertainty in its future events, measured in nats. Together, the entropy of multiple sources of uncertainty represent the overall amount of knowledge contained within the combined source of information.
