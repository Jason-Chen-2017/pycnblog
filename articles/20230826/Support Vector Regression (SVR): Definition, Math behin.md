Support vector regression, SVR, is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that uses support vectors to fit a model to a set of labeled data points. The goal of an SVM-based regression model is to find a line or hyperplane that best fits the data while still maintaining good generalization ability on new unseen data. 

In this article we will be discussing how to implement Support Vector Regression using Python's scikit-learn library. We'll also discuss the mathematical basis for SVR as well as some practical examples.

The main takeaways from this article are:

1. SVR is a powerful technique used for solving both regression and classification problems.
2. In order to apply SVR successfully, it's essential to understand its underlying maths and notation.
3. When working with SVR, you need to carefully select kernel functions based on your problem requirements. 
4. After understanding the key concepts and terms related to SVR, we can implement and use it effectively in our code using Python libraries like Scikit-Learn.


Before moving ahead let me briefly explain what is "support vector"? A support vector is a sample point within a dataset that is closest to the decision boundary of the training data. These samples provide the cornerstone of the margin between the classes and help us determine the direction of the optimal solution. An SVM algorithm attempts to create such a decision boundary by finding the best separating hyperplane amongst the available samples. The support vectors play an important role in determining the position of the decision boundary because they lie along the margin and have crucial influence on the final outcome. Therefore, their presence influences the shape of the resulting model.

# 2.Basic Concepts & Terminology
## 2.1 Introduction 
Support vector machines (SVM) are one of the most popular models used in supervised machine learning algorithms. They are particularly useful when dealing with complex datasets where there may not be any clear linear boundaries between the classes. Although simple linear models work well for certain types of datasets, more complex non-linear relationships require the use of non-parametric methods such as SVMs. 

Support vector regression (SVR) is a type of SVM algorithm used to solve regression problems. It works similar to traditional SVMs but instead of predicting discrete output values, it outputs continuous numerical values. For example, if you want to predict the price of a house given various features such as number of rooms, square footage, location etc., SVR can help you achieve this task accurately. 

## 2.2 Mathematical Formulation

Support Vector Machines(SVM), Regressions With Support Vector Machine(SVR).

SVMs formulate the problem of classifying patterns into separate categories by constructing lines that maximize the distance between the lines or hyperplanes that separate the two categories. Each input pattern is represented by a tuple $(x_i, y_i)$, where $x_i$ represents the feature vector of the input instance and $y_i$ represents the target value associated with the input instance. A hyperplane $\psi(\cdot)$ can be defined as the equation of a plane that passes through the origin and contains all the input instances $(x_i, y_i)$. This hyperplane defines the separation between the two classes. The objective function of an SVM is to choose the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the two categories. Intuitively, a larger margin means a better separation between the two classes. However, the optimization problem becomes complicated when multiple hyperplanes must be considered. To overcome these difficulties, the SVM relies on a kernel trick which transforms the input space to a higher dimension where a linear classifier can easily classify the inputs. There are several kernel functions that can be used with SVMs including polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid functions.

On the other hand, SVR is similar to SVM except that it aims at finding a function $f(\cdot)$ that approximates a given set of paired observations $(\boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{Y})$, where each observation consists of an input vector $\boldsymbol{X}_i$ and corresponding scalar target variable $\boldsymbol{Y}_i$. The approximation error is measured using a loss function, typically the mean squared error (MSE). SVR tries to minimize the prediction errors by finding the hyperplane that minimizes the maximum error. Here again, since the margin must balance between the samples, SVR requires careful consideration of the choice of kernel function to ensure accurate predictions.

## 2.3 Terminologies
Some commonly used terminologies when working with SVM include:

1. Hyperplane: A hyperplane is a subspace that lies entirely in a high dimensional space. It has no intersection points with any other subspaces. In the case of SVMs, the hyperplane is formed by taking a weighted sum of the original input variables plus a bias term.
2. Support Vector: A support vector is an observation used to construct the hyperplane. Support vectors are those observations that lie within the margins of the nearest neighboring observations. SVM training involves selecting the weight vector that maximizes the minimum distance to the support vectors, known as the margin.
3. Margin: The distance between the hyperplane and the closest support vector to the hyperplane is called the margin. If the margin is large, then the SVM assumes that the data is separated into different regions. If the margin is small, the hyperplane could capture erroneous assumptions about the data distribution. Hence, the margin controls the complexity of the model.
4. Kernel Trick: The kernel trick allows us to project the input data into a higher dimensional space where a linear separator can be drawn. Instead of directly computing the inner products of the input vectors, we compute the dot product of the input vectors after transforming them into a higher dimensional space. The transformed input vectors are now closer to being separable than the original ones. Common kernels include the polynomial kernel, RBF (radial basis function) kernel, and sigmoid kernel.

Let's move on to the implementation part.
