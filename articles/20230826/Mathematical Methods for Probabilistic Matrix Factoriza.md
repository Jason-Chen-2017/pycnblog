# 1.简介
  

Probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) is a popular algorithm for collaborative filtering that leverages both user and item latent factors to represent users’ preferences on items and discover the underlying relationships between them. In this article, we will first review some basic concepts of PMF such as user-item rating matrices, low-rank approximation, and Bayesian inference. We then introduce the mathematical framework and prove several key properties of PMF. Finally, we present several applications in recommender systems and provide code implementation of PMF algorithms with Python programming language. This article provides an efficient way for data scientists and machine learning engineers to understand and apply PMF in various scenarios.

# 2.概览
Probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) refers to a popular type of collaborative filtering method that utilizes a combination of user and item latent factors to capture the preferences of users on different items. The core idea behind PMF is to infer the user and item latent factors jointly from the observed ratings by assuming a multivariate normal distribution over these variables. To achieve this, PMF decomposes the user-item rating matrix into two lower-rank matrices: user matrix U and item matrix V. These matrices are assumed to be unobserved but generated based on certain statistical assumptions, such as non-negativity constraints or sparsity constraint. Once obtained, we can estimate the actual ratings by multiplying the corresponding rows of U and columns of V.

The main advantage of PMF lies in its ability to handle missing values and handle them gracefully through imputation techniques. It also offers interpretable results because each row of U and column of V captures the important features of the corresponding entity. Additionally, PMF is able to learn more complex dependencies among entities than traditional approaches like SVD due to the presence of user and item bias terms. Nevertheless, it suffers from limited scalability because of the need for computing the inverse of large matrices involved in the optimization process. Moreover, probabilistic inference makes it difficult to obtain accurate estimates when dealing with very sparse datasets, especially when there exist noisy ratings. Hence, additional regularization mechanisms may be required to address these issues.

In summary, PMF is a powerful yet flexible approach for recommendation system development since it models the interactions between users and items using nonlinear transformations that preserve the underlying patterns in the data without making any strong assumption about the functional form of the relationship. However, the limitations of PMF include its inability to scale well to larger datasets, difficulty in handling missing data, and less interpretability compared to other methods. Despite these challenges, PMF has been used extensively in many practical contexts, including e-commerce platforms, social networks, and bioinformatics research fields.

## 3.1 数据集及任务描述
### 3.1.1 数据集
The dataset consists of user-item ratings given by the users to items. Each row represents a rating made by one user to one item, and the cells contain their scores assigned to that item. Some entries in the matrix might be empty indicating the absence of rating. 

For example, if we have a list of books rated by users, the user-item rating matrix could look like:


| | Book A | Book B | Book C | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| User 1 | 5 | 3 | - | 
| User 2 | 4 | 2 | 1 | 
|... |... |... |... | 


Each cell shows the user's opinion on a particular book, where higher numbers indicate a higher level of interest while negative numbers suggest disinterest. In general, the goal of collaborative filtering is to predict the user's preference on new items based on the historical behavior of similar users. Thus, our task is to identify which users share common tastes and recommend books they enjoy to those who are similar to them. 

### 3.1.2 模型结构
We assume that each user $u$ has a set of latent factors $\phi_u \in R^k$, denoted by the subscript u. Similarly, we assume that each item $i$ has a set of latent factors $\psi_i\in R^k$, denoted by the subscript i. We want to find two matrices $U \in R^{m \times k}$ and $V \in R^{n \times k}$, respectively, where $m$ and $n$ are the number of users and items, respectively, and $k$ is the dimensionality of the latent factors. Let $\hat{r}_{ui} = \langle \phi_u,\psi_i \rangle$ denote the predicted rating for user $u$ on item $i$.

To train PMF model, we minimize the following loss function:
$$L(U,V) = \sum_{u=1}^m\sum_{i=1}^n[\hat{r}_{ui} - r_{ui}]^2 + \lambda ||U||_2^2+ \lambda ||V||_2^2 $$
where $r_{ui}$ is the true rating given by user $u$ to item $i$. Here $\lambda>0$ is the regularization parameter controlling the tradeoff between the smoothness term and the L2 norm penalty term. For simplicity, we usually fix $\lambda=0.01$. 

The pairwise similarity between users is measured by cosine distance between their respective vectors $\phi_u$, and the pairwise similarity between items is measured by cosine distance between their respective vectors $\psi_i$. Therefore, the objective function penalizes deviation from the true ratings while promoting similarity within communities. Since both U and V are initialized randomly, the gradient descent updates lead to iteratively improving the objective function. The final solution is found by fixing all parameters except for the ones related to the biases.

Once trained, the PMF model can be used for recommendations by finding the top-$N$ most similar users and aggregating their preferences across all available items to recommend novel items to the target user.

## 3.2 优化目标
### 3.2.1 极大似然估计与贝叶斯推断
Probabilistic matrix factorization uses a mixed linear model to approximate the ratings matrix by inferring the unknown variables $\hat{r}_{ui}$. We use a Gaussian likelihood with zero mean and unit variance to model the observation error, assuming that each rating takes on a continuous value between [1,5] with equal probability. The specific formulation involves defining three sets of variables: $\theta=\{\eta_u, \zeta_i, b_u, b_i\}$, where $\eta_u$ and $\zeta_i$ represent the user factors and item factors, respectively, and $b_u$ and $b_i$ represent the intercepts for each user and item, respectively. Then we define the prior distributions for these variables:

$$\begin{align*}&\eta_u \sim N(\mu_{\eta}, \Sigma_{\eta}) \\ &\zeta_i \sim N(\mu_{\zeta}, \Sigma_{\zeta}) \\ &b_u \sim N(0, \tau_u) \\ &b_i \sim N(0, \tau_i)\end{align*}$$

where $\mu_{\eta}$, $\mu_{\zeta}$, $\Sigma_{\eta}$, $\Sigma_{\zeta}$, $\tau_u$, and $\tau_i$ are hyperparameters chosen by the user. Note that we do not add priors for the ratings themselves since we want to learn them directly from the data. Instead, we marginalize out these variables using the known ratings $\{(u,i,r_{ui})\}_{u\in U,i\in I}$ to obtain point estimates for the parameters:

$$\begin{align*}\hat{\eta}_u &= \frac{1}{|\mathcal{I}_u|} \sum_{i\in\mathcal{I}_u} (\sigma(b_i+\zeta_ib_u)^\top \mathbf{x}_i) r_{ui}\\ \hat{\zeta}_i &= \frac{1}{|\mathcal{U}_i|} \sum_{u\in\mathcal{U}_i} (\sigma(b_u+\eta_ub_i)^\top \mathbf{y}_u) r_{ui}\\ b_u &= \frac{\beta}{\kappa_u} \left[ \sum_{i\in\mathcal{I}_u} \sigma(b_i+\zeta_ib_u) \left(r_{ui}-\frac{1}{|\mathcal{I}_u|}\sum_{j\in\mathcal{I}_u}(\sigma(b_j+\zeta_jb_u))r_{uj}\right)-\mu_{\beta}\right], \quad \beta \sim N(0,1)\\ b_i &= \frac{\beta'}{\kappa_i} \left[ \sum_{u\in\mathcal{U}_i} \sigma(b_u+\eta_ub_i) \left(r_{ui}-\frac{1}{|\mathcal{U}_i|}\sum_{j\in\mathcal{U}_i}(\sigma(b_j+\eta_jb_u))r_{ju}\right)-\mu_{\beta}'\right], \quad \beta' \sim N(0,1)\\\end{align*}$$

Here $\mathcal{I}_u$ and $\mathcal{U}_i$ are the indices of the items and users rated by user $u$ and item $i$, respectively. We use logistic sigmoid function $\sigma(x)$ to ensure that the output falls between [0,1]. We use truncated normal priors on the coefficients with standard deviation 1 to prevent divergence of the posterior density. Specifically, we choose $\mu_\beta=-1/2$ and $\mu_{\beta'}=-1/2$ so that the average rating $\bar{r}=E[\hat{r}_{ui}]$ is approximately equal to 3.0.

However, it is not obvious how to incorporate the uncertainty around the estimated parameters in the objective function. One natural approach is to use maximum a-posteriori estimation (MAP), which amounts to maximizing the logarithm of the joint density of the observed data and the model parameters subject to the condition that the predictive distribution should match the observed data closely. In MAP inference, we optimize the following loss function:

$$-\log p(R|\theta)+\mathrm{KL}(q(\theta)||p(\theta|\eta_0,\zeta_0,b_0))$$

where $R=(r_{ui})_{ij}$ is the observed rating matrix, $q(\theta)=q(\eta_u,\zeta_i,b_u,b_i|\mathcal{X})$ is the predictive distribution over the parameters, and $p(\theta|\eta_0,\zeta_0,b_0)$ is the prior distribution of the parameters given initial guesses $\eta_0$, $\zeta_0$, and $b_0$. Here $\mathcal{X}=(\mathcal{I},\mathcal{U},\mathcal{Y},\{r_{ui}\})$ is the training set consisting of all possible triples $(u,i,r_{ui})$ where $u\in U$, $i\in I$, $u$ rates $i$, and $i$ has at least one rating. The Kullback-Leibler divergence measures the difference between the empirical distributions of the learned parameters and the true distribution given fixed observations. We compute the ELBO by minimizing this loss under the variational approximation q($\eta_u,\zeta_i,b_u,b_i$) of the true posterior $p(\theta|\mathcal{X})$.

Finally, note that the above derivation assumes that every user and item is associated with a unique vector of factors $\eta_u$ and $\zeta_i$. In practice, however, multiple instances of the same user or item may have overlapping representations, leading to redundancy in the representation space. To mitigate this issue, we can use clustering techniques to group together highly correlated instances and treat them as a single entity. This reduces the size of the optimization problem and improves the quality of the learned embeddings.

### 3.2.2 惩罚项
One aspect of PMF that makes it distinct from previous approaches is its regularization mechanism that encourages the latent factors to be close to zero. This helps avoid overfitting the training data by forcing the model to learn simpler structures. In PMF, we use two types of regularization terms:

1. Sparsity penalty: We enforce sparsity by setting a sparsity threshold on the latent factors, ensuring that only the top $p\%$ absolute magnitude elements are kept nonzero.
2. Smoothness penalty: We encourage the latent factors to be smooth by adding a regularizer to the second order derivatives of the prediction formula. Specifically, we add a penalty term proportional to the square root of the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of the transformation $\mathbf{x}_i = \sigma(b_i+\zeta_ib_u)^\top$, where $\sigma(x)$ is the logistic sigmoid function.

These regularizers help balance the complexity of the model and reduce the risk of overfitting.

## 3.3 实现过程
The PMF algorithm is implemented using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and mini-batch sampling for efficiency purposes. At each iteration, we sample a subset of the training set and update the parameters according to the gradients computed on that batch. The learning rate $\alpha$ controls the step size of the gradient update and the momentum parameter $\beta$ ensures that the steps taken along the direction of the gradient are weighted relative to earlier steps towards the same minimum. We stop updating after a specified number of epochs or until convergence criteria are met.

Additionally, we can implement online update algorithms such as stochastic variance reduction (SVRG) or asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (ASGD). These algorithms take batches of examples and perform updates without waiting for the entire dataset to finish processing. They can significantly speed up the computation time depending on the hardware architecture and network bandwidth.
