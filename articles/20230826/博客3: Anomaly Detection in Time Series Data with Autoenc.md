Anomaly detection is a common task in data science that aims to identify outliers or unusual events from normal patterns of the data. The goal is to detect anomalies so as not to accidentally miss any important information contained within the dataset. In this article we will cover two types of anomaly detection algorithms for time series data: autoencoder-based and variational autoencoder-based approaches. We'll explore how they work and demonstrate their implementation on some sample data sets. Finally, we'll discuss potential future applications of these techniques and highlight challenges and limitations. Let's get started! 

# 2.基本概念术语说明
Time series data refers to a sequence of discrete observations made over a period of time. It can be used to model different processes such as sales, stock prices, sensor readings etc. Each observation typically has multiple features associated with it, such as date/time stamps, location coordinates, weather conditions etc. Time series analysis involves several steps such as trend identification, seasonality extraction, feature selection, clustering, forecasting etc. Outlier detection plays a crucial role in identifying unusual events or behaviors from the data which are usually considered malicious activities, errors, failures, anomalous behavior, deviations from normal operating procedures or other abnormalities.

In this article, we will focus on anomaly detection in time series data using both autoencoder-based and variational autoencoder-based methods. These methods use deep learning neural networks to learn representations of the input time series data and distinguish between normal and anomalous sequences by comparing their embeddings in a learned space. Both methods have been shown to perform well on a variety of time series datasets, including finance, IoT, energy, healthcare, and industrial systems. However, there are also certain advantages and disadvantages associated with each method.

# 2.1 Autoencoder-Based Approach
The basic idea behind the autoencoder-based approach is to learn efficient representations of the input time series data by compressing it into a lower-dimensional latent space while minimizing reconstruction error. This reduced representation can then be compared against the original input to detect anomalies. To achieve this, we can use standard feedforward neural networks (FFNN) with symmetric skip connections. During training, we minimize the reconstruction loss between the compressed representation and the original input.

Here is a high level overview of the architecture of an autoencoder-based approach:

1. Input time series x(t), t = 1...T is passed through the encoder network f_enc(x(t)) to generate a low dimensional embedding z(t).

2. Decoding layer g_dec(z(t)) reconstructs the original input x(t) based on the latent variable encoding obtained at step 1.

3. Reconstruction error is calculated between x(t) and the output of decoding layer g_dec(f_enc(x(t))). The objective function to be optimized during training is defined as E_l = sum((x(t)-g_dec(f_enc(x(t))))^2)/N where N is the total number of samples in the dataset. 

4. Optimization algorithm updates the weights of the FFNN to reduce the reconstruction error until convergence.

During testing, once the trained model is available, we pass new inputs through the encoder network f_enc(x(t)), obtain the corresponding embeddings z(t) and decode them back to the original form using the decoder network g_dec(z(t)). If the distance between the decoded input and the actual input is greater than some threshold value, we consider it an anomaly.

Advantages:
* Simple and effective way to extract meaningful features from time series data.
* Can handle complex non-linear relationships in the data.
* Computationally efficient since the entire process is done on GPU hardware.
Disadvantages:
* Cannot capture higher order temporal dependencies due to sequential nature of time series data.
* Treats all dimensions equally and does not take into account the significance of individual variables.
* Difficult to interpret since the intermediate layers do not provide insightful insights into why a specific point is classified as an anomaly.

# 2.2 Variational Autoencoder-Based Approach
A major limitation of the autoencoder-based approach is that it cannot capture the uncertainty inherent in the data distribution. For example, if we have only one realization of a stochastic process, its encoded representation would look similar to all other encodings generated for different realizations of the same process. This issue is further exacerbated when dealing with multi-variate time series data, where we may want to identify subtle variations in the data which are difficult to isolate and explain.

To address this issue, we can use variational autoencoder (VAE) as our anomaly detection technique. VAE learns a probabilistic latent space where each dimension corresponds to a hidden variable and the probability density functions of the variables are determined by neural networks. By doing this, we can represent the latent space in terms of a multivariate Gaussian distribution parameterized by mean vector μ and covariance matrix Σ. This means that we now have a more flexible and tractable way to characterize the distributions of the input data.

One key difference between vanilla autoencoders and VAEs lies in the fact that the former learn a deterministic mapping from input to output, whereas the latter generates a random sample from the learned distribution. This ensures that the network learns good representations of the data without being biased towards any particular configuration.

Here is a high level overview of the architecture of a VAE-based approach:

1. Input time series x(t), t=1...T is fed to the encoder network f_enc(x(t)).

2. The mean μ and log variance σ of the approximate posterior distribution q(z|x) are computed by passing the output of the encoder network through another set of fully connected layers f_mu(h) and f_logvar(h). These parameters define the mean and diagonal elements of the covariance matrix Σ of the approximate posterior distribution.

3. A random normal noise variable ε is sampled from the standard normal distribution using the reparametrization trick.

4. The latent variable z(t) is then obtained by adding the mean μ and scaled epsilon values: z(t) = μ + exp(σ/2)*ε.

5. Finally, the decoded output x(t) is obtained by passing the latent variable z(t) through the decoder network g_dec(z(t)).

At test time, given a new input x(t+1), the approximate posterior distribution p(z|x) can be updated using Bayes' rule: p(z|x) = ∏q(zi|x) * p(zi), where πi denotes the prior probability of observing i-th component of the latent variable z under a standard normal distribution. The maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters μ, Σ of the true underlying data distribution is obtained by maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO): ELBO = -KL[q||p] - L[p], where KL[q||p] is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the approximate posterior and prior distributions.

As long as ELBO is greater than a predefined threshold, we classify the new point as anomalous. Otherwise, we classify it as normal.

Advantages:
* Can handle both continuous and categorical variables.
* Flexible representation of the data distribution by capturing uncertainties in the data.
* Captures higher order temporal dependencies via the inference model.
Disadvantages:
* Requires careful hyperparameter tuning to avoid mode collapse or slow down learning rate.
* Can lead to slower convergence and more prone to local minima.
