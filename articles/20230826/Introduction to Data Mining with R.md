# 1.简介
  

Data mining is a process of analyzing large datasets to extract valuable insights and knowledge that can help businesses make decisions or predictions. It involves using various techniques such as clustering, classification, regression analysis, association rules learning, and neural networks for discovering hidden patterns in the data. R has been one of the most popular programming languages used for data mining because it provides an easy-to-use environment for performing statistical analysis on complex data sets. In this article, we will explore how to perform basic data mining tasks using R.

## What is Data Mining?
Data mining refers to the process of extracting meaningful information from large amounts of data by applying statistical algorithms. The goal of data mining is to identify patterns, relationships, correlations, and trends in the data so that useful insights can be generated. Data mining is particularly helpful when applied to big data, which is increasingly becoming more common and challenging to manage. 

## Types of Data Mining Techniques 
There are several types of data mining techniques:

1. Classification - Dividing observations into groups based on certain criteria
2. Regression Analysis - Predicting numerical outcomes based on input variables
3. Clustering - Grouping similar objects together based on their attributes
4. Association Rule Learning - Identifying frequent itemsets and their corresponding rules
5. Neural Networks - A type of machine learning algorithm that uses artificial neurons to model complex systems
  
In this article, we will focus on performing these five types of data mining techniques using R. Let's get started!


# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before we dive into technical details, let's first discuss some fundamental concepts and terminology related to data mining. This section briefly introduces some commonly used terms and explains their significance within the context of data mining.

## Attributes and Examples
Attributes describe different aspects or characteristics of the entities being analyzed, such as age, gender, income, occupation, etc. These attributes may have different scales depending on the problem being solved. For example, if we are trying to predict whether someone is likely to click on an advertisement based on their demographics like age, gender, education level, location, and income, then each attribute would have a binary scale (male/female) while others might have a numeric scale (age between 18 and 75).

Examples refer to individual instances of the entity being analyzed, also known as records or items. Each record typically contains values for all its attributes. For instance, consider a dataset containing information about people who purchased products online. Each record could contain personal information like name, email address, date of birth, phone number, billing address, payment history, product purchase history, and other relevant details.

## Data Sets and Variables
A data set consists of a collection of examples (records), where each example is associated with multiple variables representing different attributes. There are three main types of variables: 

1. Numerical Variables - These are quantitative variables that measure properties like height, weight, salary, etc., and represent continuous values. They range from positive and negative infinity upwards. 
2. Categorical Variables - These are qualitative variables that classify things into categories like gender, race, marital status, and occupation. They consist of discrete finite sets of possible values.
3. Binary Variables - These are variables that take two possible values either true or false, yes or no, etc.

The output variable(s) represents the value we want to predict or classify new examples into. Depending on the problem being solved, there may be only one output variable or multiple output variables. For example, in a credit card fraud detection scenario, the output variable would be "fraud" indicating whether a transaction was fraudulent or not, whereas in a marketing campaign prediction scenario, we might have multiple output variables such as sales revenue, clicks, customer engagement, etc.

## Target Variable
The target variable is the variable we are interested in predicting or classifying our examples into. This is usually determined beforehand based on what the task requires us to achieve. For example, in a credit card fraud detection scenario, we might choose to detect transactions that were fraudulent versus those that were legitimate, meaning that we would need to specify the target variable to be "fraud." On the other hand, in a marketing campaign optimization scenario, we might want to optimize the placement of ads on social media platforms according to the predicted impact on customer engagement metrics like likes, comments, shares, etc.

## Training Set vs Test Set
When training a model, we split the available data into a training set and a test set. The training set is used to fit the model parameters, while the test set is used to evaluate the performance of the model after training. By evaluating the accuracy of the model on unseen data, we ensure that the model generalizes well to new data. We should avoid overfitting the model by making sure that the training error is low while the testing error is high.
