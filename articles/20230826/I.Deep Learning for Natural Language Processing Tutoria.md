# 1.简介
  

Natural language processing (NLP) is one of the most significant fields in AI and has a wide range of applications such as text analysis, sentiment analysis, machine translation, chatbots, and named entity recognition. In this article we will go through the popular deep learning techniques used to solve natural language problems using BERT, GPT-2, and T5 models. We will discuss their basic ideas, mathematical formulas, architecture designs, code examples with comments explaining each line, and future research directions. 

To make our blog more relevant and attractive to people interested in NLP, we will assume that readers have some experience in programming or data science. Also, all content will be written from scratch without any use of pre-existing libraries and frameworks. This makes it suitable for beginners who are just starting out in NLP and want to understand how these techniques work under the hood. 

 # 2.Terminology & Basic Ideas
Before diving into technical details let’s quickly talk about the terminology and basic ideas behind the popular NLP algorithms:

 ## 2.1 Pretrained Models vs Fine-tuned Models
The first thing we need to know is what type of model do we usually encounter when dealing with NLP tasks? The two types of models are pretrained models and fine-tuned models. A **pretrained model** is an already trained model on large datasets like Wikipedia and Common Crawl. It can perform well but may not have domain-specific knowledge or capability. On the other hand, a **fine-tuned model**, also known as transfer learning, learns from a related task and improves its performance by adapting to new domains or tasks.

In NLP tasks where only limited labeled training data is available, fine-tuning helps improve accuracy significantly. With this technique, the weights of a pre-trained model are transferred to a new model and then retrained on our specific dataset. By doing so, the model effectively inherits the strengths of the pre-trained model while also adding additional capacity and customizing it to fit our needs.

 ## 2.2 Tokenization and Embedding
When working with natural language, we often break it down into smaller units called tokens. Each token represents a meaningful element such as a word, phrase, sentence, punctuation mark, etc. These tokens are combined together to form sentences, paragraphs, or even entire documents. Before feeding these sequences of tokens to the neural network, we need to convert them into numerical vectors which represent their meaning. This process is known as tokenization and embedding.

One common approach to tokenize words is to split them based on whitespace characters. However, splitting words in this way does not capture relationships between different parts of speech, verbs tenses, and modifiers. To overcome this problem, modern NLP systems rely heavily on embeddings, i.e., continuous representations learned from large corpora of text. There are several ways to create embeddings including word embeddings, character-level embeddings, subword embeddings, and transformer-based models.

## 2.3 Contextualized Representation
Modern NLP techniques typically involve contextualizing words by looking at previous and subsequent words in a sequence. This provides valuable information not only for understanding the current word but also for predicting its surrounding context. For example, given the input "the cat sits", the system should be able to identify that the cat is modifying the verb "sit". Similarly, if the input were "I love coffee" the system should learn that "coffee" modifies the adjective "love." Another important feature of contextual representation is the ability to encode semantic similarity between words. If two terms appear frequently in similar contexts, they should likely have similar meanings.

Neural networks have shown great promise in solving complex NLP tasks using the attention mechanism. Attention allows us to focus on relevant elements within a sequence and ignore irrelevant ones. It works by calculating the importance of each element in the sequence according to a query vector and passing it along the computation graph. During decoding time, we pass the query vector back through the network to obtain the final output sequence.
