Deep learning has been an increasingly popular field recently due to its impressive performance in various fields such as image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition and so on. In recent years, deep neural networks have achieved great success by using large amounts of training data for supervised learning tasks such as classification and object detection. However, building a new deep learning architecture from scratch requires large amount of resources and time. To reduce the time and cost, many researchers started applying Transfer Learning which uses a pre-trained network’s learned features and retrains it on target dataset with limited or no labeled data available. This way, we can train our models much faster and achieve better accuracy than building them from scratch. In this article, I will explain how to implement Transfer Learning technique to fine tune the pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to meet specific data needs without training from scratch.

In this tutorial, we will be using VGG19 CNN as a pre-trained model and working on CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of 60K images of size 32x32 pixels each belonging to 10 classes - airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck. 

Transfer Learning is usually used when we are dealing with small datasets and want to leverage a well-trained feature extractor instead of starting from scratch. We can also fine tune these pre-trained models further based on our specific requirements by adding more layers or changing some hyperparameters. 

Overall, Transfer Learning helps us to save time and resources by taking advantage of a well-tuned model that already performs very well on a wide range of problems. It allows us to focus our efforts on designing custom architectures for individual tasks rather than building complex systems from scratch. Let's get started! 

# 2.基本概念、术语及定义
Before diving into the technical details of Transfer Learning, let's first understand some basic concepts related to Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. 

## Neural Network
A neural network is an artificial neural network consisting of interconnected nodes or neurons, where information is processed sequentially through forward propagation and feedback loops are established between output layer and input layer. Each node receives input from other nodes and processes the information according to certain activation functions to produce outputs. The overall goal of a neural network is to learn patterns from the given inputs and identify correlations between different variables to help make predictions or decisions. In this process, weights associated with connections between the nodes are updated during backpropagation to minimize errors or losses while adjusting the weights to correct any biases along the path.

## Convolutional Neural Network
Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are neural networks inspired by the structure of the visual cortex, specifically the central visual area, which are designed to process visual imagery. ConvNets apply filters to the raw pixel values of an image, resulting in a set of feature maps that capture specific features of the original image. These feature maps then become the input to subsequent layers in the network, allowing the system to extract higher level abstractions from the raw visual data. 

The key idea behind convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is the concept of convolutional layers, which are typically followed by pooling layers to downsample the feature maps and reduce their spatial dimensions, and fully connected layers at the end of the network, which perform classification or regression on the flattened feature vectors produced by the convolutional layers. The power of CNNs lies in their ability to automatically adapt to variations in the underlying data distribution and learn generalizable representations of the input space.

We will now go over some important terms and concepts related to Transfer Learning and Pre-Trained Models.

 ## Transfer Learning
 Transfer Learning refers to a machine learning technique where a pre-trained model is used as a starting point for another task. Instead of training the entire model from scratch, we reuse the pre-existing knowledge of the model and train the last few layers to suit our current problem. This approach saves a lot of time compared to training from scratch, especially if the pre-trained model was trained on a large dataset. 

 Another benefit of Transfer Learning is that it enables us to build more accurate models since it can take advantage of the pre-existing knowledge gained from previous tasks and transfer it to the current task. For example, if we have a pre-trained model for image classification, we can easily add additional layers to classify objects beyond what was seen in the training set. Additionally, Transfer Learning can improve robustness and consistency across similar tasks, reducing the chances of overfitting. 
 
 There are two main types of Transfer Learning:

 ### 1. Feature Extraction 
 In this method, the pre-trained model is frozen and only the final layers of the model are trained on top of it to predict the desired class labels. This effectively reduces the number of parameters in the network and makes it easier to optimize. Typically, the pre-trained model is not re-initialized and only the newly added layers are initialized randomly.
 
 ### 2. Fine Tuning 
 In this method, both the base pre-trained model and the added layers are trained together. The objective function involves optimizing both the pre-trained layers as well as the newly added ones simultaneously to ensure that they stay synchronized. If the fine tuning is done for a relatively small number of epochs, the model might suffer from catastrophic forgetting i.e., losing all the knowledge gained in the earlier phases of training. Therefore, it's essential to keep track of validation loss and stop early if there is no significant improvement after several iterations. 

 ## Pre-Trained Model
 A pre-trained model is a neural network that is already trained on a large dataset and whose parameters have been fixed. The purpose of having a pre-trained model is to enable faster convergence and better performance than training one from scratch. Common pre-trained models include ResNet, VGG, MobileNet, and Inception.
