# 2.Background Introduction
The healthcare industry has been investing heavily in big data technologies over the past few years. This has resulted in a massive increase in the amount of data available which can be used to improve the health outcomes of patients. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and their ability to analyze large amounts of unstructured data has further transformed the way we interact with our healthcare professionals. While this technology enables us to diagnose diseases more accurately, it also requires a shift in mindset towards treating disease symptoms rather than using medical procedures. It is becoming increasingly difficult for physicians to keep up with rapid advances in diagnosis and therapy. Therefore, there is a need to develop systems that enable doctors to consult with machines instead of relying on physical examination techniques alone.  

To tackle this problem, several companies are working together to create platforms that allow doctors to share clinical records electronically with automated tools. One such platform called Precision Health has recently launched in Europe as an example of this progress. Precision Health uses machine learning algorithms to suggest optimal treatments based on patient symptoms. Moreover, they use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand the content of patient notes so they can better classify them. These insights can help doctors identify patterns that can be used to optimize care management strategies for specific patient populations. Similar benefits have also been observed from leveraging the power of AI algorithms for precision medicine projects at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. By automating pathology report generation, image analysis, and interpretation, hospitals can spend less time analyzing tons of images and reports and more time caring for patients.   

While the introduction of big data technologies and AI-powered solutions has made significant improvements in the accuracy and speed of disease diagnosis, the current model still suffers from several drawbacks. Firstly, accurate data collection and storage is still challenging due to privacy concerns and scalability issues. Secondly, traditional clinical workflows remain dominant, making it difficult for doctors to collaborate effectively or take advantage of new technologies. Thirdly, lack of real-time monitoring can lead to disparities in patient care quality. Lastly, increased demand for personalized medicine raises ethical and legal considerations. 

It is essential to address these problems while ensuring that the public receives high-quality medical care, preventing serious long-term health risks. To achieve this vision, several initiatives are being taken by governments, research organizations, and various stakeholders including pharmaceutical companies, insurers, policy makers, regulators, tech giants, and patient groups. Let’s look deeper into some of the main drivers behind these trends: 

1. Massive Data Collection and Storage

Big data technologies are transforming the way we collect, store, and manage healthcare data. As mentioned earlier, the amount of data collected and stored has grown exponentially over the past decade. This data includes clinical notes, lab results, X-rays, CT scans, MRI images, vital sign readings, social media posts, voice recordings, and other electronic medical records. This data is critical for improving medical care because it provides information on complex conditions and illnesses, enabling physicians to devise targeted treatments. With ever-increasing volumes of data, effective data analytics and mining algorithms must be developed to extract meaningful insights and drive value-added decision support applications. In particular, biomedical informatics (BMI) is playing a pivotal role in addressing these challenges, especially when it comes to handling large datasets and integrating diverse sources of data such as text, images, videos, and audio signals. With the development of cloud computing and big data architectures, institutions can now streamline the process of collecting and storing medical data. 

2. Democratization and Collaboration between Doctors and Clinicians

Democratization and collaboration are two important factors driving the growth of the healthcare industry. Traditional models of medical education and practice have failed to meet the needs of modern societies where individuals have more access to information and expertise. Medical training programs should be offered to everyone regardless of age, gender, race, religion, or socioeconomic status. Moreover, newer imaging modalities such as MRI, CT, and X-ray show promise for faster and more detailed diagnosis. In fact, numerous studies have shown that detectable differences between normal controls and abnormal cases can be detected early enough in disease stages with early detection via MRI or CT scanning. Therefore, new technologies and approaches are required to encourage more citizens to participate in the medical field. In order to achieve this goal, healthcare providers need to rethink the way they approach patient care and partner with physician colleges and networks globally. 

3. Bigger Pharma Industry Benefits from Artificial Intelligence

Pharmaceutical companies have a clear competitive advantage by having vast amounts of raw data available for drug discovery and development. However, these data sets are typically limited to small sample sizes. With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, pharma companies can leverage their huge data sets to build predictive models that can accurately target low-risk patients who require specialty medicines. For instance, major cancer drugs like estrogen receptor modulators (ERMs) and antiangiogenic agents depend on genetic mutations in the cells of the tumors to function properly. But if gene mutation is detected early, it can reduce the risk of cancer mortality. This knowledge can then be leveraged by pharma companies to prescribe such medicines only to patients who have a high risk of developing cancer. Similarly, advanced models can learn to recognize patterns and relationships among different medical concepts such as symptoms, lifestyle, and risk factors to optimize drug dosage and delivery. Furthermore, AI-driven drug design processes can produce high-quality drug candidates that can combat common side effects and enhance efficacy compared to conventional methods. Overall, artificial intelligence may unlock the full potential of pharma companies' data sets and offer cost-effective solutions that directly benefit consumers. 

4. Emergence of Personalized Health Care Needs through Sensing Technology

Personalized medicine refers to the provision of individualized medicine based on one's unique medical history, demographics, lifestyle, and preferences. This concept emerged as a response to growing expectations of a healthy lifestyle, balanced diet, and affordable healthcare options. Despite the importance of personalization, most of the existing healthcare solutions remain non-personalized despite significant investment in sensor technologies and mobile apps. Ever since Apple released the iPhone with Touch ID security feature, millions of people around the world have become familiar with facial recognition, GPS tracking, and push notifications. It is estimated that half of all adults have already started taking selfie checks on social media sites. This suggests that smartphone sensors have started to permeate every aspect of our lives, and it would be great if these technologies were leveraged for improved healthcare experiences. Focusing solely on static data is not enough; by incorporating contextual factors, users can receive customized medicine recommendations. New technologies such as wearables, internet of things (IoT), and virtual reality could enable users to connect with devices and share their data with healthcare professionals. In summary, smart and connected devices can offer personalized and continuous medical advice, leading to reduced healthcare costs and satisfaction levels for both patients and healthcare professionals alike. 

5. Ubiquitous Monitoring for Continuous Improvement

Continuous improvement is another crucial driver of the economic viability of the healthcare industry. Achieving higher level of efficiency, reducing waste, and improving patient safety are just a few of the many goals set out by the World Health Organization (WHO). Understanding the underlying dynamics of human behavior and enhancing communication across organizational boundaries can help bring about breakthroughs in medical education, clinical practices, and interventions. Systems such as hospital information systems (HIS) can facilitate effective collaboration between doctors and administrators and improve patient care quality by collecting, managing, and sharing relevant data within an integrated environment. These technologies can also be used to automate routine tasks and ensure compliance with best practices. Additionally, mobile app development can help patients stay updated with latest health news, medical procedures, and emergency alerts. Overall, accelerated digitization of healthcare markets will put in place new paradigms for achieving higher standards of healthcare quality and delivering better outcomes for patients.
