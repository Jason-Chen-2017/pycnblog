Supervised learning (SL) is a type of machine learning in which the algorithm learns from labeled data to predict or classify new, unseen data points based on a training set that contains both input and output values. The goal is for the algorithm to learn such patterns that can be used to make predictions on future, unlabeled data sets. 

In supervised learning, we have a dataset consisting of input features and corresponding output variables. We train our model using this dataset by feeding it into an algorithm, such as logistic regression or support vector machines (SVMs), and adjusting its parameters until it correctly classifies all samples in the dataset. Once trained, the model can then make predictions on new, unseen inputs.

Supervised learning algorithms typically require large amounts of labelled data to achieve good accuracy. However, these datasets are often very complex and noisy, requiring expert human intervention to create labels. To address this issue, researchers have developed semi-supervised learning methods that leverage partially labeled data to improve their performance. These methods combine some amount of manual labelling with automated techniques, making them more effective than purely unsupervised approaches when limited resources are available.


There are several types of SL problems, including classification, regression, clustering, and density estimation. In this article, I will focus on classification problems, which is the most common form of supervised learning problem. Specifically, I will explain how to use logistic regression to solve binary classification problems, where there are two possible outcomes ("positive" or "negative").

Before diving into the topic, let's first understand what logistic regression is and why it is useful in solving classification problems.

# 2.Logistic Regression Introduction
## 2.1 What Is Logistic Regression?
Logistic regression is a popular statistical method used for binary classification tasks, also known as binary logistic regression. It is a type of linear regression analysis that is commonly used for forecasting purposes and has gained widespread popularity due to its ease of interpretation and simplicity compared to other linear models like polynomial regression.

In logistic regression, the dependent variable y takes only one of two possible values, usually denoted by either 0 or 1. For example, in medical diagnosis, whether someone has a certain disease (y=1) or not (y=0). Similarly, in credit scoring, whether a person is likely to default on a loan (y=1) or not (y=0). The logistic function is used to transform the predicted probabilities between zero and one, giving us the probability of each sample being classified as positive. This is different from ordinary linear regression, where the outcome variable is continuous.

The logistic function, also called sigmoid function, can be defined mathematically as follows:

$$\sigma(z)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}=\frac{\exp(z)}{\exp(z)+1}$$

where z represents any real number. When x becomes extremely large or small, $\sigma$ tends towards $0$ or $1$, respectively, thus indicating high or low likelihood of occurrence of the event. The graph of the sigmoid function is shown below. As you can see, it saturates at $0$ and $1$, making it ideal for modeling binary responses.


To perform logistic regression, we assume that the log-odds ratio (OR) between the two classes can be written as a linear combination of the independent variables plus a constant term. Mathematically, the formula for OR can be expressed as:

$$ln(\frac{p}{1-p}) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{1} +... + \beta_{n}x_{n}$$ 

where p is the estimated probability of the positive class. Therefore, given an instance described by x=(x1,...,xn), the probability of belonging to the positive class can be calculated as:

$$p = \frac{1}{1+\exp(-\beta_{0}-\beta_{1}x_{1}-...-\beta_{n}x_{n})}$$

We want to find optimal values for the coefficients $(\beta_{i})$. One way to do so is through maximum likelihood estimation, which involves maximizing the likelihood function, also called the log-likelihood function.

## 2.2 Example
Let's consider the following scenario. Suppose we want to develop a classifier to determine whether a patient has heart disease or not. We have historical data about patients' cholesterol levels and age, along with their results on a clinical trial, which indicates if they had heart disease (either malignant or benign). Our goal is to build a model that accurately predicts if a new patient who meets certain criteria will eventually develop heart disease.

First, we need to clean up the data by removing missing values and handling outliers. Next, we can visualize the relationship between cholesterol levels and age using scatter plot to identify potential correlation between them. Based on the visual inspection, we decide to include both predictor variables in our model.

Once the data is ready, we fit a logistic regression model using statsmodels package in Python. Here's the code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix,accuracy_score
import seaborn as sns

df = pd.read_csv('heart_data.csv')

# Convert categorical column 'target' to numerical format
df['target'] = df['target'].map({'malignant': 1, 'benign': 0})

# Split data into X (predictors) and Y (output variable)
X = df[['age', 'cholesterol']]
Y = df['target']

# Create a logistic regression model object
logreg = LogisticRegression()

# Fit the model using X and Y
logreg.fit(X, Y)

# Make predictions on test data using.predict() method
Y_pred = logreg.predict(X)

# Print the confusion matrix and accuracy score
print("Confusion Matrix:\n",confusion_matrix(Y, Y_pred))
print("\nAccuracy:",accuracy_score(Y, Y_pred))

# Plot ROC curve to evaluate the model
from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve
fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(Y, Y_pred)
plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], 'k--')
plt.plot(fpr, tpr, label='Logistic Regression')
plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')
plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')
plt.title('ROC Curve')
plt.show()
```

This code reads the CSV file containing the heart disease data, converts the target column from string to numerical format, splits the data into predictors (X) and output variable (Y), creates a logistic regression model object using scikit-learn library, fits the model to the data, makes predictions on the same data using the `.predict()` method, prints the confusion matrix and accuracy score, and plots the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve to evaluate the model's performance.

As expected, the model achieves over 85% accuracy on the test data, but does well in identifying people who are unlikely to develop heart disease while still having reasonable accuracy in identifying those who are highly likely to develop heart disease.
