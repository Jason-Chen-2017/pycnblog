Time series forecasting is the process of predicting future values based on past observations and trends. It helps organizations to make informed decisions by anticipating upcoming events and providing timely advice. In this article we will explore six python libraries that are popular for time series forecasting problems. The main purpose of our analysis is to understand which library suits best for a particular problem scenario, identify any potential drawbacks and compare them with other alternatives if required. We will also discuss some common issues faced during data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis steps involved in time series forecasting. Finally, we will apply each library to real-world scenarios and evaluate their performance metrics and results. 

In order to create an accurate model, it’s essential to preprocess and clean the input data properly before applying machine learning algorithms. This involves identifying missing or incorrect values, handling outliers, transforming variables into suitable formats and normalization. Data visualization techniques like scatter plots, line graphs, heat maps can be used to understand patterns and relationships between different features within the dataset. Seasonality, autocorrelation and stationarity tests can help identify underlying structure within the data and improve the accuracy of the model predictions.

Some of the commonly used statistical methods include ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average), ETS (error-trend-seasonal) models, FBProphet, VAR (vector autoregression) and LSTM (long short-term memory). Each algorithm has its own unique set of advantages and disadvantages, making it necessary to choose the most appropriate one for a specific type of time series data. Also, care should be taken while selecting hyperparameters such as the order of AR/MA components and seasonality periodicity to avoid overfitting and underfitting. To optimize the model for better results, cross-validation techniques can be employed to split the training dataset into multiple subsets and train the model on all but one subset, evaluating the performance on the remaining subset using various evaluation metrics. Grid search or randomized search can be used to find the optimal combination of parameters that lead to highest accuracy. Overall, proper understanding of time series concepts and tools can save significant amounts of development time and resources.
