2. 基本概念及术语
## 2.1 社交媒体平台
Social media platforms (SMPs) are digital communication platforms that offer users the ability to interact with their fellow community members through various social networking features such as posting content, liking posts, commenting, sharing images or videos, following people, etc. Popular SMPs include Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, WhatsApp, TikTok, WeChat, etc. These platforms allow users to share information in real-time about a variety of topics including politics, entertainment, sports, science, health, etc., and engage in online conversations via comments, likes, shares, etc. As we can see from this definition, the vast majority of SMPs are designed to attract users by providing interactive and informative content, which can be shared widely across different networks. Therefore, it is crucial for marketers to understand how these platforms work and what marketing strategies they can use to promote their brands effectively. 

## 2.2 广告系列产品
Advertising series products refer to popular brand advertising methods typically used in today's modern age. These include paid search ads, display ads, social media advertisements, and sponsored content. Paid search ads involve using keywords related to your business or industry to find relevant listings within Google Search results, displaying them on top, and driving clicks. Display ads comprise banner ads, text ads, video ads, and other types of promotional materials that appear on website pages and mobile apps. Social media advertisements involve promoting your brand by tweeting, uploading photos or videos, making short articles, asking questions, or simply sharing links to your website. Sponsored content refers to any form of paid or unpaid promotional material, such as videos, blogs, podcasts, newsletters, magazines, etc., uploaded by third parties or directly into SMP platforms. In addition to traditional direct selling techniques, some marketers may also leverage SMM (social media marketing), which involves developing creative content targeted towards specific audiences and promoting them through social media channels.

In order to promote a brand effectively on social media platforms, marketers must have an understanding of the basic concepts behind how audience reactions influence behavior. Understanding audience reactions is critical to optimizing social media campaigns, as well as creating effective ad copy to increase brand awareness and traffic generation. The first step to understanding audience reactions is to analyze the demographics of your target audience and determine which social media platform(s) will be most effective for your brand. To do so, you should focus on metrics such as follower count, impressions, reach, engagement rates, engagement time, page views, and click-through rates (CTR). Once you identify the most suitable platform for your campaign, you need to ensure that your messaging is appropriate and aligned with your brand values. Moreover, you should stay on top of emerging trends in social media marketing, including virality, fake news, spammy bots, and online harassment. You should also avoid sending too many messages at once or overly personalized content, which could lead to disengagement and potentially decrease your brand’s visibility. Finally, make sure that your ad copy includes relevant and engaging imagery, calls to action, and explanations for why your brand is successful on social media.
