最近，深度学习网络在图像、视频、文本等领域表现出了惊人的成果。这些神经网络模型已经能够做出很好的图像识别、视频理解、文本分类等任务。但是训练这些模型是一个不易的过程，需要对优化方法进行正确的选择，才能达到良好的效果。本文主要介绍一些常用的优化算法，并从深度学习模型的角度出发，分析这些优化算法的优缺点，以及如何更有效地应用它们。
# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
# 2.1 Gradient Descent
Gradient descent (GD) is a widely used optimization algorithm in machine learning that finds the minimum of a function by iteratively moving towards its direction of steepest descent. The basic idea behind gradient descent is to find the optimal set of weights or parameters $w$ that minimize the cost function J(w), which measures how well the model fits the training data. GD starts with an initial value of $w$, then computes the gradient of J at point $w$ along the direction of steepest ascent, and updates the parameter $w$ in the negative direction of this gradient:
$$
\begin{aligned}
    w_{t+1} &= w_t - \eta \nabla J(w_t) \\
            &= w_t + \Delta_t = w_t - \eta \frac{\partial}{\partial w_t}J(w_t)\\
    &= w_t - \eta \sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\partial}{\partial w_{ij}}J(w_t)e^{-\lambda i} x_j^{(i)}\\
\end{aligned}
$$
where $\eta$ is the step size (also known as the learning rate) hyperparameter, $\nabla J(w)$ is the gradient of the cost function $J(w)$ with respect to the vector of parameters $w$, $\lambda$ is the L2 regularization hyperparameter, and $x_j^{(i)}$ is the input feature vector of the $i$-th example. In other words, the update rule multiplies each component of the gradient by the negative learning rate and adds it to the current weight values.
The key insight behind GD is that it can converge much faster than other optimization algorithms when appropriate hyperparameters are chosen, such as choosing the right step size $\eta$. However, the choice of the learning schedule is not always straightforward because different problems have different features and constraints, making it difficult to choose the best learning rates without a priori knowledge about the problem. To overcome these issues, several adaptive learning schedules were proposed, including AdaGrad, RMSprop, Adam, etc., which automatically adjust the learning rate based on the magnitude of the gradients at each time step. These methods often provide better convergence properties compared to standard GD while requiring fewer tuning hyperparameters.
# 2.2 Momentum
Momentum (MoM) is another popular technique that helps accelerate GD's convergence by adding a momentum term $\beta$ to the update rule. This term tells us what direction we should move the parameter before taking a bigger step, so that it will continue moving in that direction even if the gradient keeps pointing in the opposite direction. Mathematically, MoM represents the accumulation of past gradients, and the updated rule becomes:
$$
\begin{aligned}
   v_t &= \beta v_{t-1} + \eta \nabla J(w_t) \\
   w_{t+1} &= w_t - v_t \\
\end{aligned}
$$
In other words, instead of updating the weight directly using the gradient information, we compute the momentum term using the previous velocity estimate ($v_{t-1}$) and the new gradient info ($\nabla J(w_t)$), add them together, and take a small step in the direction of the accumulated momentum, which results in improved convergence properties. Empirically, setting the momentum coefficient $\beta$ between zero and one works well across different types of tasks.
# 2.3 Adagrad
Adagrad (AG) combines ideas from both GD and MoM by introducing two modifications. Firstly, it adds an additional accumulator variable to store the square of the gradient at each iteration, called "accumulated gradient". Secondly, it uses the accumulated gradient to adaptively scale the step size, so that the updates are smaller for dimensions where the gradient changes slowly and larger for those where it fluctuates more rapidly. The resulting update rule is given by:
$$
\begin{aligned}
   g_t &= \frac{\partial}{\partial w_t}J(w_t) \\
   acc_{dw_t} &= \epsilon^{-1}acc_{dw_{t-1}} + g^2_t \\
   w_{t+1} &= w_t - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{acc_{dw_t}}}g_t \\
\end{aligned}
$$
Here, $\epsilon$ is a small constant added to avoid division by zero, and $\eta$ is the same as before. The advantage of AG is that it has built-in support for sparse gradients, which means that the optimizer ignores any dimensions with low absolute gradients during the update process.
# 2.4 Adam
Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) is yet another optimization method that combines ideas from multiple other techniques. It incorporates the advantages of GD, MoM, and AG into a single framework. Specifically, it uses exponentially weighted averages of the gradients and their second moments to calculate the adaptive learning rate, allowing it to account for recent variations in the gradient distribution. Moreover, it also includes bias correction terms to correct for initialization biases that may cause the early iterations to be too large. Finally, it provides an option for decoupled weight decay, which allows some weights to remain fixed during training without being included in the regularization term. The complete update rule is given by:
$$
\begin{aligned}
   m_t &= \beta_1m_{t-1}+(1-\beta_1)\nabla J(w_t) \\
   v_t &= \beta_2v_{t-1}+(1-\beta_2)(\nabla J(w_t))^2 \\
   \hat{m}_t &= \frac{m_t}{1-\beta_1^t}\\
   \hat{v}_t &= \frac{v_t}{1-\beta_2^t}\\
   w_{t+1} &= w_t - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{\hat{v}_t}} \hat{m}_t (\alpha / \sqrt{\hat{v}_t}+\frac{1-\alpha}{t})^\zeta \\
\end{aligned}
$$
Here, $\beta_1,\beta_2$ are hyperparameters controlling the exponential moving average of the first and second moments respectively; $\alpha$ is a parameter freezing the variance of the update history; and $\zeta$ controls the degree of exploration versus exploitation in case of nonconvex optimization problems.
Overall, all of the above optimization techniques try to solve two fundamental challenges in deep learning: (a) finding the best local minima of the loss function, and (b) maintaining reasonable performance even when facing stochastic noise or inputs with varying scales or ranges. The relative strength of these approaches depends on the specific characteristics of the task and the architecture of the network. As usual, there is no golden recipe for selecting the right combination of techniques, but careful consideration of these factors can help achieve good performance in practice.
