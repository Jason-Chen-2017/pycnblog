Semi-supervised learning is a subset of machine learning where some labeled data are available but many unlabeled ones are present. In this type of learning, both labeled and unlabeled examples contribute to building an accurate model that can handle new situations with limited training data. The semi-supervised learning techniques can be classified into two categories: supervised and unsupervised approaches. In this article, we will focus on supervised approaches as they provide more insights about the problem than unsupervised methods. We have reviewed several supervised learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Random Forest, etc., which all belong to the supervised category.
In this study, we will discuss four popular supervised semi-supervised learning algorithms, namely Label Propagation (LP), Self Training (ST), Co-Training (CT) and Learning with Noise Correction (LCNC). These algorithms perform better than their counterparts in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and memory usage when applied to large datasets. They work by exploiting the relationships between features or classes in the dataset and transfering them to other samples through propagating labels from similar instances. Furthermore, these algorithms do not require any additional annotations and can learn automatically from small amounts of labelled data. Hence, they make it easier to use the algorithms in applications such as image classification, text analysis, bioinformatics, and sentiment analysis. Finally, we also highlight their advantages and disadvantages and summarize its application in various fields including medical imaging, security, finance, social network mining, and recommendation systems.

## 3.1. Supervised vs Unsupervised learning
Supervised learning refers to the process of training a machine learning algorithm using labeled input data. It involves setting up a training set consisting of inputs along with corresponding outputs, and the goal is to train a classifier or regression function to map inputs to correct output values based on previously seen examples. On the other hand, unsupervised learning allows us to analyze a dataset without having any prior knowledge of the target variable(s). This could involve clustering, pattern recognition, or dimensionality reduction. 

In contrast, semi-supervised learning is a subcategory of supervised learning, where only part of the data has been labeled. The goal is to create a model that can effectively predict the missing labels while still being trained on a balanced amount of labeled and unlabeled data. One of the most common approaches used in semi-supervised learning is called label propagation, which uses the relationship between pairs of labeled objects to propagate those labels to similar unlabeled objects. Another approach known as self-training is focused on incorporating unlabelled examples into the training process itself to improve performance. Moreover, there are variants of semi-supervised learning such as co-training, which combines multiple annotators’ results to generate pseudo-labels and improve prediction accuracy.

## 3.2. Label Propagation Algorithm
Label propagation algorithm works under the assumption that if a pair of labeled objects is similar, then their labels should also be similar. For example, let's assume that we have two sets of points A and B, where each point represents a person and his/her gender attribute. If two male people are closer together in space compared to female people, then we might conclude that the genders of those people would be highly correlated. Similar reasoning applies to any related attributes that occur often in real-world scenarios.

The basic idea behind label propagation algorithm is to start with a few seed labels assigned to the unlabeled points and then iteratively assign the same label to neighboring unlabeled points until convergence. Specifically, at every iteration i, a label l_i is chosen randomly from the current set of labels, say {l_1, l_2,..., l_{i-1}}. Then, all unlabeled points that share a direct connection with at least one labeled point are given the same label as the selected label l_i. Mathematically, the equation to compute the updated label for an unlabeled object j is:

l_j^{i+1} = argmax_(l \in L)(\sum_{k \in N^+(j)} w_{jk} * l_k) 

where L is the set of all possible labels, k is a neighbor of j, and w is a weight parameter that determines how much influence a particular neighbor has on the final label.

The main advantage of label propagation over traditional clustering algorithms like K-means is that it does not require a predefined number of clusters and assigns different cluster labels to individual points depending upon the local geometry around it. Additionally, it handles complex data structures easily because it considers the similarity among objects instead of treating them as separate entities. However, it requires sufficient labeled data to obtain good performance and may converge to local optima.

## 3.3. Self-Training Algorithm
Self-training algorithm is another variant of semi-supervised learning that aims to leverage the unsupervised information obtained from unlabeled examples during training. At each step, a subset of unlabeled examples is added to the existing training set and retrained. During training, the model learns both labeled and unlabeled data simultaneously and uses feedback from the newly trained model to selectively choose useful examples for future iterations. Specifically, at each iteration t, n unlabeled examples are sampled randomly from the pool of unlabeled data X and concatenated with a portion of labeled data Y. Then, a deep neural network DNN is trained on the augmented dataset (XU + Y) using backpropagation, just like usual supervised learning. At test time, the learned model replaces the original classifier C for testing purposes.

One way to reduce overfitting is to use early stopping, which stops the training process after observing that validation loss starts increasing again, indicating overfitting. Another technique is to apply regularization, such as dropout, to prevent the model from memorizing specific patterns in the labeled data. Overall, self-training provides improved performance over baseline methods when labeled data is scarce or partially unavailable. However, it may suffer from slow convergence due to repeated updates to the model parameters.

## 3.4. Co-Training Algorithm
Co-training algorithm was proposed as a means to combine multiple annotators' opinion to improve prediction quality. The principle behind co-training is to build a shared representation of the feature space across annotators by jointly optimizing a convex optimization problem over multiple tasks. At each iteration, a subset of unlabeled examples is partitioned into two parts, say X1 and X2, where half of the examples come from one annotator and the other half comes from the second annotator. Both annotators are trained independently on their respective partitions while sharing the latent representations generated by the first annotator via a linear transformation W. Once trained, the models are combined by taking a weighted average of their predictions using hyperparameters γ and ε, respectively. Hyperparameter selection can be done using cross-validation techniques, and gamma and epsilon depend on the level of agreement and tradeoff between the cost functions of the annotators. The benefit of co-training is that it takes into account the collective knowledge of multiple experts to achieve better accuracy than a single expert alone.

However, co-training may need to be adapted to suit the specific annotation task, since it relies heavily on the availability of high-quality labeled data from multiple annotators. Moreover, the choice of alpha, beta, gamma, and epsilon is important for obtaining the best performance and ensuring fairness in the decision-making process. As for choosing the right annotator, the authors suggest selecting experts who have different levels of experience, skills, and domain knowledge.

## 3.5. Learning with Noise Correction Algorithm
Learning with Noise Correction (LCNC) is yet another variation of semi-supervised learning algorithm. Instead of assuming that noisy unlabeled examples cannot contain valuable information, LCNC focuses on identifying and removing noisy examples before feeding them to the standard supervised learning algorithms. The key idea behind LCNC is to detect the noisy examples using outlier detection techniques and remove them from the unlabeled set before applying the learning method. Outlier detection techniques typically measure the distance between the nearest neighbors of an instance and identify those instances whose distances are significantly greater than the median distance.

To further improve the robustness of the system, LCNC also incorporates entropy measures that evaluate the degree of uncertainity in the predicted labels. Entropy measures take into account the impurity of the distribution of probabilities associated with the predicted labels. To enforce consistency in the learning process, LCNC ensures that the uncertainty in the predicted labels is reduced below a certain threshold. With these modifications, LCNC can improve the overall performance of the learning algorithm and adapt well to diverse environments.
