Attention mechanisms are one of the most important components of visual processing in deep learning systems for computer vision tasks such as image classification and object detection. In this survey, we will briefly discuss the fundamental principles behind attention mechanisms and summarize how they can be applied to a variety of computer vision tasks using various methods like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) or transformer models. We also provide insights into different approaches used by researchers to address challenges such as vanishing gradients and multi-head attention, which have been proven effective in improving performance of recent CNN based architectures. This survey serves as an essential resource for researchers and engineers who want to understand the working mechanism and potential benefits of attention mechanisms in computer vision applications and adapt them accordingly to their specific use cases and requirements.

Attention mechanism是深度学习在计算机视觉任务中最重要的组成部分之一。通过对图像特征进行注意力机制的引导，神经网络能够自动提取有效信息并从整体全局考虑，帮助模型识别出物体。Attention mechanism基于一种称为Attention weight的权重系统，它能够将不同位置的特征映射到不同的时间步长上，以便能够专注于需要关注的区域或目标。Attention mechanism起源于NLP领域，并被广泛应用在神经机器翻译、文本生成、摘要、对话回复等领域。

3.核心概念术语
In general, attention mechanisms can be broadly classified into three categories based on whether it is designed to focus on individual elements at each time step or entire sequences of elements. These categories are:

1. Local attention mechanisms that apply attention weights only to individual elements within a sequence: Examples include dot product attention and additive attention layers employed in recurrent neural networks (RNNs). 

2. Sequence attention mechanisms that apply attention weights over entire sequences: Examples include self-attention layers employed in transformers and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 

3. Hybrid attention mechanisms that combine local and global information: These types of mechanisms combine the strengths of both local and sequence attention mechanisms to achieve better results than either alone. Examples include hybrid computing models combining CNNs with RNNs for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. 

Based on these categories, several variants of attention mechanisms have been proposed to improve the overall efficiency, accuracy, robustness, and scalability of computer vision systems. The following sections present the detailed theory and implementation of each type of attention mechanism.

4.Local Attention Mechanisms
Dot Product Attention
The dot product attention layer was first introduced in [Bahdanau et al., 2014] as a method for calculating attention weights between input query vectors and output feature vectors from an encoder. It takes two inputs - the query vector and the set of key-value pairs representing the values to attend - and produces an attention distribution over all values given the query. At each time step, the weighted sum of the value vectors is computed and passed through another fully connected layer to produce the final output. Dot product attention has been shown to work well in practice for many NLP tasks due to its simplicity and ease of training. However, its limitations are that it cannot handle sparse interactions between input tokens because it relies solely on element-wise multiplication of queries and keys. Additionally, since it requires comparing every pair of query and key vectors at each time step, it may not perform well for large sets of data or high dimensional features. Therefore, there have been several attempts to modify it to address some of these issues.

Multi-Head Attention Layer
In order to address the above mentioned limitations of dot product attention, multiple heads were introduced in [Vaswani et al., 2017]. Each head performs a different set of queries and keys against different parts of the same input, reducing the chance of collisions between similar key-value pairs. The resulting attention distributions obtained from each head are then concatenated and fed back to the next layer alongside the original query vector. Multi-head attention has become the dominant attention mechanism used in modern deep learning models. However, it suffers from high computational cost due to the multiple matrix multiplications involved, making it impractical for large datasets and complex tasks such as image captioning. To reduce the computational burden, fast approximate algorithms like linear attention have been developed.

Additive Attention Layer
[Luong et al., 2015] introduced a simplified version of multi-head attention called "additive" attention. Here, instead of computing the attention distributions independently for each head, they are added together before being processed by the decoder. This approach makes use of the fact that the attention weights across different heads are uncorrelated and can therefore be approximated using a single tensor. Despite its simplicity, additive attention remains highly effective even when trained with stochastic gradient descent and achieves competitive performance compared to more complex models like multi-head attention. However, it still does not directly model non-linear dependencies between input tokens, and thus it may not capture global relationships within longer sequences. Moreover, adding up multiple heads can lead to saturation of the activation function in intermediate layers, leading to degraded performance and instability during training. There has been ongoing research to develop alternatives to additive attention that do not suffer from these drawbacks, including dot-product attention and softmax attention.

Transformer Decoder Block
A novel architecture called the transformer decoder block was proposed in [Vaswani et al., 2017] that combines ideas from both multi-head attention and auto-regressive decoding. Here, each transformer decoder block consists of multiple stacked attention layers followed by a position-wise feedforward network. Unlike traditional seq2seq models, the transformer's autoregressive decoding allows it to generate outputs conditionally on previous outputs rather than just predicting the next token in sequence. While conceptually simple, this architectural choice enables the transformer to exploit long-range dependencies among input tokens while generating accurate and coherent predictions. Although relatively new, the transformer decoder block has received significant attention from the machine learning community, gaining widespread popularity and becoming a dominant building block for state-of-the-art models in a range of NLP, speech recognition, and translation tasks.

Attention Pooling Layers
Another way to incorporate global contextual information into attention mechanisms is to introduce pooling layers. These layers take the attention distributions calculated by a series of attention layers and pool them globally to obtain a fixed-size representation of the input. Several popular pooling techniques include average pooling, max pooling, and self-attention pooling. Self-attention pooling uses a special attention mechanism that pools representations of the input based on the attention distribution generated by the current decoder hidden state. By allowing the decoder to selectively pay attention to relevant regions of the input, self-attention pooling provides greater flexibility than other pooling techniques and is often used in conjunction with other attention mechanisms. Other pooling techniques can help regularize attention mechanisms by encouraging them to look at disparate parts of the input without relying too heavily on any particular part. Nonetheless, none of these techniques have proved to be strictly necessary for achieving good performance in most scenarios.

Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)
One of the earliest and most commonly used attention mechanisms is the long short-term memory (LSTM) unit. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that are capable of handling sequential data, meaning that they retain information over extended periods of time and can process data in chunks rather than processing it in a stream. LSTMs consist of a cell that processes incoming data and maintains a record of what happened previously, and an output gate that controls the flow of information from the cell to external output units. The basic idea behind LSTM attention mechanisms is to allow a model to decide which parts of the input should be given higher importance in the current calculation based on past calculations made by the LSTM cell. LSTMs have been shown to be particularly effective for capturing long-range temporal dependencies and have made great advances in natural language processing, voice recognition, and image analysis tasks. Nevertheless, the limitation of LSTMs' ability to store and recall sequential information means that they are not suitable for dealing with truly global concepts or patterns, and they fail to make full use of contextual information.

5.Sequence Attention Mechanisms
Self-Attention Layer
The self-attention layer is a core component of transformer models. The central idea of self-attention is to compute a weighted combination of all input elements that can be used to attend to different positions within the sequence. The attention weights are computed using a scaled dot-product attention formula that takes into account the cosine similarity between query and key vectors. Self-attention has been found to significantly outperform other attention mechanisms in sequence modeling tasks, such as language modeling and machine translation. Like LSTMs, transformer models rely on a specialized attention mechanism for encoding and decoding input sequences, but whereas LSTMS require manual design of attention functions, transfomer models learn to automatically extract the relevant information from the input by optimizing a loss function. Self-attention also alleviates the problem of scaling difficulty associated with long sequences by explicitly computing attention weights that involve entire subsequences of length n without having to iterate over all possible permutations. Overall, self-attention has made major progress towards solving the expressiveness limit of vanilla RNNs while still providing strong empirical evidence for its effectiveness on diverse sequence modeling tasks.

Transformer Encoder Block
The transformer encoder block is a lightweight variant of the transformer decoder block where only the attention layers are retained and the projection and normalization layers are replaced by convolutional layers. This reduces the amount of computation required compared to a standard transformer block and allows the transformer to encode images, videos, or audio signals efficiently. Similar to the transformer decoder block, the transformer encoder blocks can be stacked to increase representational capacity. With appropriate hyperparameters and regularization techniques, transformers have shown to consistently outperform LSTMs and LSTMs have shown to be able to scale much deeper than they otherwise would. However, although transformers are capable of processing longer sequences and accounting for global structure, the inner workings of the models remain opaque and difficult to interpret, limiting their applicability in real world settings. Moreover, transformer models assume that the input sequences are pre-segmented into manageable sized segments and operate under the assumption that the inputs are ordered, which may not always hold true. For example, medical text often contains structured clinical notes with additional metadata about patients, procedures performed, diagnosis, etc. that need to be preserved throughout the processing pipeline.

Convolutional Neural Network
Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promise in addressing the problem of high dimensionality of natural language data, making them attractive candidates for sequence modeling tasks like sentiment analysis or named entity recognition. CNNs are mainly used for extracting features from raw input sequences and preserve the spatial structure of the data. As opposed to traditional RNNs that consider the entire sequence at once, CNNs consider each word individually, enabling them to capture local and global aspects of the data simultaneously. CNNs also offer powerful ways of exploring the spatiotemporal nature of the data, making them ideal for analyzing video, audio, and image data. Despite their success, however, CNNs struggle to leverage the attention mechanism effectively and typically fall short of human performance on certain sequence modeling tasks. For instance, when performing image classification tasks, CNNs have shown to outperform humans on certain benchmark datasets, but they struggle to accurately reason about the contextual relationships between objects and ignore distractor words or phrases that may not carry crucial information for classification. To address these issues, the transformer models and other sequence attentions have recently emerged as promising alternatives that enable deep understanding of the input sequences.
