# 1.简介
  

DE（Differential Evolution）算法是一种进化计算优化算法。它通过模拟自然界中生物进化过程中的多峰值函数模型（种群的适应度函数），从而寻找全局最优解，属于非全局优化算法，即没有保证找到全局最优解的特点。其主要思想是利用差异来代替随机选择，使得算法更加鲁棒和高效。

DE 的基本思路就是模拟自然进化现象，不断地迭代并更新种群的适应度和位置。每个个体以一定概率随机变异其位置或基因（即离散选择）。当某个个体的适应度发生变化时，其他个体也跟随改变。每隔一定时间或者当适应度收敛到一个稳定水平时，停止迭代。

## 2.1 概念阐述
 Differential evolution (DE) is a stochastic population-based optimization algorithm that belongs to the class of evolutionary algorithms. It uses randomized or differential manipulations on selected individuals within a population in order to improve the search for global optima by simulating the natural selection process with multimodal functions and characteristics [1]. 

The basic idea behind the DE algorithm is to randomly modify certain components of an individual (called "mutations") while keeping others unchanged, allowing the population to explore different solutions simultaneously. The modified individuals then compete against each other to find better ones until convergence or a predetermined termination condition is met. To maintain diversity in the resulting set of candidates, it may selectively replace members of the previous generation based on their relative fitness scores. 

At its core, the DE algorithm works by applying two crucial principles:

 - Explore the solution space: Instead of focusing on the single best candidate at any given time, the algorithm explores multiple local minima simultaneously by modifying parameters randomly. This allows it to escape from local optima and converge towards a more optimal solution. 
 - Use a tournament model: The way individuals interact during competition plays an important role in determining the shape of the search landscape. In DE, individuals are paired together using a tournament model where one participant (the winner) receives advantages over the other(s). In this manner, individuals can exploit complementary information to help them discover new regions of the search space that they would otherwise miss due to being trapped at local minima.

In summary, the main goal of the DE algorithm is to find good solutions to complex problems without relying too much on a deterministic approach like gradient descent or gradient ascent techniques. Rather than searching directly for the minimum or maximum value, it aims to find a diverse set of high-quality solutions through a probabilistic exploration of the solution space.

## 2.2 基本概念
 ### 2.2.1 目标函数
 The objective function is what we want to minimize or maximize. We represent the objective function $f(\textbf{x})$ as a real scalar value. In contrast to popular methods such as gradient ascent or gradient descent, which require us to specify a direction to move in, DE operates on a discrete representation of the solution space, making it suitable for large-scale optimization tasks. 

 ### 2.2.2 个体（Individual）
 An individual is defined as a point in the parameter space $\textbf{x} = \{ x_1,\cdots,x_n\}$ and represents some possible solution to the problem. Each individual has several attributes such as position ($\textbf{x}$, called the genotype), fitness score ($F$, also known as the objective value), age, parent(s) and offspring(s). Each component of the genotype must be between zero and one, representing a binary choice (equivalent to choosing between two values) or a quantitative value. For example, if we have four variables, our genotype could be represented as $(0,1,0.5,0.7)$. 

 
 
 ### 2.2.3 种群（Population）
 A collection of individuals (or agents) is referred to as a population. The size of the population defines how many potential solutions there are to consider in finding the global optimum. As with traditional optimization methods, the quality of the initial population affects the rate at which the algorithm converges to the optimal solution. However, similarly to the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), it may not always be necessary to start with a well-formed population, since DE will take care of creating a decent starting point automatically.

 ### 2.2.4 遗传算子（Mutation operator）
 A mutation operator takes an input chromosome/individual, mutates it slightly (by adding or removing bits or changing gene values), and returns the resulting mutant. Mutations can be applied uniformly across all genes or only to specific genes depending on the implementation. Common examples include bit flips, swap mutations, scramble mutations, and polynomial mutations [2].

 ### 2.2.5 选择算子（Selection operator）
 A selection operator selects parents (i.e., individuals) to produce offspring for the next generation. There are several ways to choose the parents, including roulette wheel selection, tournament selection, ranking selection, and crowding distance selection [3]. Population size should be increased periodically when no improvement has been made, or else the effectiveness of the algorithm will be reduced. If the selection pressure is too high, the number of non-optimal solutions produced could become prohibitively large, leading to poor performance. Similarly, if the selection pressure is too low, the algorithm may struggle to find optimal solutions because it cannot expand into areas of the search space that were previously underexplored. Additionally, regularization techniques such as shrinkage, perturbation, or regularization can be used to prevent premature convergence or explosion of the search space.

 ### 2.2.6 适应度评估（Fitness evaluation）
 During the course of an iterative optimization procedure, each individual's fitness needs to be evaluated based on its genotype. These evaluations are typically done numerically via simulations or expensive numerical calculations, but can also be estimated using heuristics such as the rank fitness scheme or racing schemes. The aim of these evaluations is to determine the suitability of an individual for survival in the subsequent generations. Once the fitness values are available for every member of the population, the population is sorted based on their relative importance and a specified percentage of individuals is removed according to various criteria, such as elitism, inverse cumulative fitness weighting (ICFW), or niching strategies [4].

 ### 2.2.7 进化规律（Evolving mechanism）
 Within the context of the DE algorithm, we need to understand how the elements of the population interact to generate offspring, mutate individuals, and select the fittest individuals to breed to create new populations. Here are the key concepts and steps involved:

 1. Selection: Individuals are selected for reproduction by selecting two parent individuals (either randomly or according to some criterion, such as roulette wheel selection). They form a child individual by combining traits from both parents, possibly through crossover (homologous segments of DNA combined to produce novel alleles) or asexual reproduction (identical copy of DNA created). 
 
 2. Mutation: Depending on the implementation of the algorithm, mutations can occur at varying rates and strengths. Mutation operators add noise or change small sections of the genetic material, causing variations in the phenotype of the individual. Common types of mutations are bit flips, swap mutations, and polynomial mutations. 
   
    Bit flips alter one bit of the genotype randomly either to the opposite state (0 -> 1 or 1 -> 0) or remain the same (with probability 0.5). This type of mutation results in a lesser degree of genetic drift than other forms of mutation and produces a more stable population. Swap mutations involve exchanging the positions of a subset of genetic material, which can lead to more natural looking solutions. Polynomial mutations introduce small changes to the genotype by multiplying or dividing some values by constants and adding or subtracting products or quotients [5].
     
 3. Crossover: Homologous segments of DNA are combined through crossover to generate novel alleles, which contribute to the development of more robust individuals that are more likely to resist natural selection. Crossover usually involves an equilibrium point in the middle of the two parental sequences, at which point the alleles switch direction. Alternatively, homologous loci can be joined end-to-end instead of split in half. 
   
   Crossover leads to a greater degree of genetic diversity in the population, which helps to avoid degeneracy, i.e., the emergence of a unique solution that does not depend on external factors such as environmental conditions. 
     
 4. Reproduction: After producing children, they enter into competition with the current population to see who is most fit. Those with higher fitness levels are retained and others are replaced according to the designated selection method [6].  
      
 
## 2.3 参数设置
The primary hyperparameters of the DE algorithm are:

- **population size**: Defines the number of individuals (agents) in the population. Larger populations generally result in a better search, but come at the cost of computational resources and slow convergence times. Typical values range from 30 to 100. 
- **crossover rate**: Determines the likelihood of introducing crossover between two individuals during reproduction. Small values reduce the chance of crossover happening, whereas larger values increase the frequency of crossover. Typical values range from 0.5 to 0.9. 
- **mutation rate**: Determines the likelihood of mutating an individual during reproduction. Small values reduce the chances of mutations, whereas larger values increase the frequency of mutations. Typical values range from 0.01 to 0.2. 
- **selection strategy**: The method used to select parents for reproduction during the course of an iteration. Various approaches exist, including roulette wheel selection, tournament selection, etc. Roulette wheel selection assigns a portion of the fitness value to each individual (between 0 and 1) and draws random numbers between zero and the sum of these portions until it finds an individual whose drawn number falls within the corresponding interval. Tournament selection involves pairings of individuals, where one individual competes against another randomly selected group of participants until one individual wins out. Crowding distance selection works by assigning a crowd distance metric to each individual, which measures the amount of individuals located nearby. Those with a lower crowd distance are more likely to be selected, although this method is sensitive to population size and could cause premature convergence or excessive clustering if left unregulated. Finally, Fitness sharing involves allocating a portion of the total fitness among the top performing individuals, ensuring that highly fit individuals are selected for reproduction even if the population is not wide enough to cover all of the elite niches.
