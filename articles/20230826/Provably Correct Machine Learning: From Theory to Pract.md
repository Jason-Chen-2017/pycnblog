随着医疗图像技术的日益发展，对图像分析中的机器学习算法进行保证正确性、可靠性变得越来越重要。Provably correct (PC) machine learning is an approach that uses mathematical theory and techniques to show the presence of errors or biases in a model without actually training it on real data. It has been used extensively for medical image analysis applications such as diagnosis and prognosis. In this article, we will cover the basics of PCML using medical image analysis examples.

In order to understand PCML, we need to have a basic understanding of some fundamental concepts.

1. Data distribution: The input data we use for training our ML models contains multiple features, and these features are usually measured with various accuracies depending on their nature (e.g., intensity measurements can be made at different resolutions). Therefore, we cannot assume any specific accuracy inherent to each feature when computing its statistics (mean, variance), which can affect our confidence level of the model's performance. To mitigate this problem, we typically normalize all our inputs by scaling them to zero mean and unit variance before feeding them into the model. Normalization ensures that all features are weighted equally during training and testing, and therefore provides more reliable estimates of model parameters. 

2. Model uncertainty: Since we do not know the true underlying function that generated the observed data, there is always a certain degree of uncertainty involved in predicting outputs from the model. This uncertainty reflects both the intrinsic noise introduced by the dataset itself, but also the complexity of the task itself (i.e., how complex is the relationship between the input features and output labels?). For example, if the relationship between features and labels is highly non-linear, then even very accurate models may produce unreliable predictions due to overfitting or underfitting issues. Another source of uncertainty is the model selection process - since there are many ways to train and optimize machine learning models, it is often difficult to obtain consistent results across different runs. 

3. Overfitting and Underfitting: When a model is trained too closely to the training set, it becomes prone to overfitting - meaning it starts memorizing the training data instead of generalizing well to new data. On the other hand, when a model is not able to capture the true underlying pattern in the data, it suffers from underfitting. In either case, the model's ability to perform well on new data decreases drastically as the amount of available training data increases. Therefore, it is important to ensure that our models are tuned appropriately to avoid these problems. 

4. Bayesian inference: Probabilistic programming offers a powerful framework for handling uncertainties in probabilistic models by allowing us to encode assumptions about possible worlds and derive probability distributions from our data using statistical inference methods. A common algorithm for performing Bayesian inference is called Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which samples parameter values based on the joint posterior distribution given the observed data. MCMC requires careful initialization and tuning to avoid getting stuck in local optima and obtaining reliable results. However, because of the combinatorial explosion associated with high dimensional data, it is impractical to run MCMC algorithms directly on large datasets. Thus, we typically approximate the joint posterior using simpler, less computationally expensive distributions like Gaussian processes, kernel density estimation (KDE), or decision trees.

5. Performance metrics: Before jumping straight into PCML, it is essential to understand what types of evaluation metrics we should use to measure the quality of our model's predictions. For medical image analysis tasks such as segmentation, classification, and regression, commonly used metrics include Dice score, average precision, Jaccard index, cross entropy loss, and mean squared error. These metrics provide useful insights into the quality of the predicted outputs relative to the ground truth labels, but they are not perfect measures of model's overall performance. 

6. Bias and Variance tradeoff: As mentioned earlier, PCML is all about assessing the reliability of our model's predictions. One way to do this is to compare the bias and variance of the estimated prediction curve with respect to the actual test set. If the estimated curve has higher variance than the actual curve, this indicates that the model has high sensitivity to small changes in the input data, while lower bias suggests that the model is fairly calibrated. Conversely, if the estimated curve has higher bias than the actual curve, this indicates that the model fails to fit the training data well, while lower variance suggests that the model is flexible enough to handle variations in the input data. We want to find a balance between high bias and low variance to minimize the impact of potential model errors.
