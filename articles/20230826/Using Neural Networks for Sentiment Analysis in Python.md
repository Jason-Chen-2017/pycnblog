# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology 
Before we move on to the main part of our article, it is important to define some basic concepts and terminology that will be used throughout this tutorial. 

We will briefly discuss the following topics:

1. What is a neural network? 
2. Types of neural networks and their applications
3. Components of a neural network model (Input layer, Hidden layers, Output layer)
4. Activation functions and their purpose

6. Gradient Descent optimization algorithm

## 2.1 What is a Neural Network?
A neural network, also called a deep learning model or artificial neural network (ANN), is a type of machine learning algorithm that enables computers to learn from data by processing inputs through hidden layers. The core idea behind neural networks is inspired by the structure and functionality of the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) that take input data, process it through an activation function, and then pass the output back to other neurons. These connections are formed into layers, which can be stacked upon each other to create complex models. In the simplest terms, a neural network is just a mathematical function that maps an input set to an output set. However, its true potential comes from its ability to learn and adapt based on feedback received from the environment. This makes neural networks ideal for tasks where there is no clear definition of a target output. They are particularly useful for solving complex problems that require multiple inputs and outputs. Examples include image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.


## 2.2 Types of Neural Networks and Applications
There are several types of neural networks, including feedforward neural networks (FNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and autoencoder networks. Here's an overview of these different types:

1. Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN): FFNs consist of fully connected layers of neurons. Each neuron receives input from all the previous neurons in the same layer as well as from the input layer. They pass the result through an activation function before being sent to the next layer. The last layer contains one neuron per class label, with a softmax activation function for multiclass classification problems. 

2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): RNNs are similar to FNNs but they have additional loops that allow information to persist over time. An RNN uses sequential data like text, audio, and video. The state of the system at any given time influences how the input is processed at the next time step. For example, when predicting the sentiment of a sentence, the words in the sentence carry over from one time step to the next. Another example is music generation using sequence to sequence models. LSTM networks are special cases of RNNs that are optimized for handling long term dependencies. 

3. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are specialized for computer vision tasks. They use filters to extract features from images and apply them to downstream tasks such as object detection, face recognition, and document analysis. A typical CNN architecture involves pooling layers, convolutional layers, and dense layers. 

4. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: LSTMs are extensions of traditional RNNs designed to handle vanishing gradients. They are especially effective for processing temporal data that has long range dependencies. 

5. Autoencoder Networks: Autoencoders are neural networks that are trained to reconstruct their input without introducing errors. The goal is to recreate the original input while minimizing the number of lost units and maximizing the number of preserved units. Autoencoders are commonly used for dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, and noise removal. 

In general, most neural networks can perform regression, binary classification, and multiclass classification tasks. While more complex architectures may be required for advanced tasks such as semantic segmentation or speech synthesis, simpler structures such as FNNs and RNNs can often be sufficient for simple applications. 

## 2.3 Components of a Neural Network Model
Here are the components of a neural network model:

1. Input Layer: This represents the initial input dataset, which is typically transformed through various techniques such as normalization and feature engineering before entering the network. The size of the input layer corresponds to the number of features in your input data. 

2. Hidden Layers: Hidden layers contain the majority of the computational power of a neural network. There can be multiple hidden layers in a neural network, each containing a set of neurons that together form a layer. The size of each hidden layer depends on the complexity of the problem being solved and the amount of training data available. Typical sizes of hidden layers range between 10 to 500 neurons depending on the problem. 

3. Output Layer: The final layer contains the predicted values or labels for the input data. The size of the output layer corresponds to the number of classes involved in the task. For binary classification, the output layer would have two neurons representing the probability of belonging to either class. For multi-class classification, the output layer would have as many neurons as there are classes. Depending on the loss function chosen, the network parameters can be adjusted so that the network learns the optimal mapping from the input to the output space. 

The overall shape of the neural network model is determined by the combination of the above three components. Additionally, there are other optional components such as dropout regularization and batch normalization that further improve the performance of the model. 

## 2.4 Activation Functions and Purpose
Activation functions are mathematical functions that determine the output of a node in a neural network. Without activation functions, the network would not be able to learn and make predictions about the input data correctly. Various activation functions are commonly used, including sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, softmax, linear, and others. Let's discuss each of them:

1. Sigmoid Function: The sigmoid function is widely used in neural networks because it saturates and centers around 0, making it useful for binary and multi-class classification tasks. Its equation is f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x)). The derivative of this function gives us the slope of the line at point x. 

2. Tanh Function: The hyperbolic tangent function is another popular choice for activating neurons in neural networks. Unlike the sigmoid function, its range is -1 to 1, making it suitable for handling real valued inputs rather than probabilities. It has been shown empirically to outperform the sigmoid function in certain contexts. The formula for the tanh function is f(x) = (e^(x)-e^(-x))/(e^(x)+e^(-x)), where x is the input value. The derivative of this function is f'(x) = 1 - f(x)^2. 

3. ReLU Function: Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is a very simple yet effective activation function. It returns zero for negative input values and leaves positive values unchanged. It has become quite popular due to its simplicity and efficiency. The forward propagation equation for ReLU is max(0,x). The backward propagation equation is df/dx=1 if x>0 else 0, where x is the input value. 

4. Softmax Function: Softmax function is used in multi-class classification tasks when the output variables represent probabilities. It normalizes the input vector to ensure that all elements add up to one and that all entries are non-negative. The softmax function has two advantages: First, it provides a measure of the certainty associated with each possible outcome. Second, it can convert the unbounded output of a linear activation layer into a probability distribution. The softmax function is defined as follows:


    Where z is the net input, i denotes the index of the largest element in z, and N is the total number of possible outcomes. The softmax function takes advantage of the fact that maximum value in the array is obtained when all elements of the array are multiplied by minus one. Therefore, subtracting the maximum value from every element of the array ensures that none of the exponentiated values becomes too large. Finally, dividing each element of the resulting array by the sum of all elements ensures that all elements add up to one, making them valid probabilistic distributions. 

5. Linear Function: The linear function is essentially equivalent to passing the input through a linear transformation, without applying any activation function. In practice, this means that the output of the linear layer directly proceeds to the subsequent layer without modifying the signal. The benefit of having a linear activation function is that it allows the network to fit complex relationships between the input and output spaces, potentially leading to better results. The linear activation function is simply y = x.  

Overall, activation functions play a crucial role in determining whether a neural network is able to learn complex patterns in the input data and produce accurate predictions. The choice of activation function should depend on the nature of the problem being solved, such as binary vs. multi-class classification, continuous vs. categorical input, and so forth. We need to strike a balance between selecting a functional form that captures the underlying physics of the problem and producing interpretable results. 

## 2.5 Common Activation Functions

Now let's consider some common activation functions:

1. Sigmoid Function: The sigmoid function is generally used in binary and multi-class classification tasks. It ranges from 0 to 1, and has the property that it becomes more saturated as the input increases towards infinity. It performs well even for small variations in the input, giving good gradient flow during backpropagation. It has been shown that the sigmoid activation function works best for deep neural networks with multiple layers. 

2. Tanh Function: The tanh function is usually preferred over the sigmoid function for real-valued inputs since it can handle larger ranges and produces smoother curves. As mentioned earlier, it has been shown to work better for deep neural networks with multiple layers. 

3. ReLU Function: The rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function is less computationally expensive than both the sigmoid and tanh functions. It is particularly beneficial for deep neural networks with multiple layers. During training, it introduces non-linearity in the decision boundary, allowing the model to learn complex relationships between the input and output spaces. Even though it can suffer from dying ReLU problems, such as saturation and vanishing gradients, ReLU functions still manage to solve practical tasks effectively. 

4. Softmax Function: The softmax function is often used in multi-class classification tasks when the output variables represent probabilities. It converts the output of a linear activation layer into a probability distribution that adds up to one. It can help in preventing overfitting and helps to increase the stability of the learning process.

5. Leaky ReLU Function: A variant of the ReLU function known as leaky ReLU is popular when dealing with deep neural networks. Instead of returning zero when the input is negative, it instead outputs a small negative value, creating a "leak" in the function. This can help in preventing dead ReLU problems, but may slow down convergence. Overall, the choice of activation function varies depending on the specific requirements of the problem.
