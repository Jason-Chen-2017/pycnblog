#  Intel.AI is a cloud-based platform that provides artificial intelligence solutions to businesses and organizations around the world. Based on its mission of advancing technology and driving innovation, Intel.AI offers various artificial intelligence services such as natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV) and machine learning (ML). It also has over 7 years of experience building AI solutions for industries ranging from healthcare to finance. 

In this article, we will explore how Intel.AI helps organizations utilize their data resources more effectively by using Natural Language Processing techniques for insights extraction. We will go through each step involved in NLP processes and understand how it can be applied to analyze customer feedbacks and other types of textual data. Finally, we will provide practical examples demonstrating how Intel.AI can help organizations make better decisions based on customer sentiment analysis results.

This blog post serves as an example of a technical blog post about Artificial Intelligence, covering topics such as basic concepts, algorithms, code implementation and case studies. We hope you find it useful! 

Let’s get started with our exploration of how Intel.AI uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract insights from customer feedback. To begin with, let’s look at what NLP is all about. 


# 2.What is Natural Language Processing?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to the use of computers to understand and manipulate human languages. It involves the automatic manipulation of natural language into structured or unstructured formats so that machines can easily process and analyze large amounts of information. The tasks performed by NLP include:

 - Text classification: categorizing texts into different classes or categories
 - Sentiment Analysis: analyzing the sentiment expressed within a text
 - Entity Recognition: identifying entities present in a text such as persons, organizations, locations, etc.
 - Topic Modeling: clustering similar documents together based on common topics
 - Summarization: creating a brief summary of a longer document or piece of text
 - Automatic translation: translating one language into another
 
 
As mentioned above, NLP can perform a wide range of tasks depending upon the type of input data used. In our context, we are looking at extracting insights from customer feedback which contains free-form text.


# 3.How does Intel.AI Use NLP to Extract Insights From Customer Feedback?

When customers give feedback on products and services, they often leave reviews that contain valuable information regarding the quality of the product/service and whether the service was provided efficiently. However, these comments may not always be helpful in making business decisions.

To address this issue, Intel.AI uses natural language processing techniques to automatically extract insights from customer feedback. Here are the steps taken by Intel.AI when dealing with customer feedback:


1. Preprocessing: Before processing any feedback, the system performs some preprocessing to remove stop words, punctuations, HTML tags, URLs, emojis, special characters, etc., leaving only essential words and phrases. This ensures that the system focuses solely on meaningful information instead of noise. 

2. Tokenization: Once the feedback is preprocessed, it needs to be tokenized into individual words or phrases. This allows the system to identify the specific parts of speech associated with each word, making it easier to categorize and analyze the content. 

3. Stemming and Lemmatization: After tokenizing the feedback, the system applies stemming or lemmatization to reduce inflectional forms of words to their base form. For instance, “running” and “run” would both become "run". This makes it easier for the system to recognize variations of the same concept without having to manually specify every variation.

4. Part-of-speech tagging: The next step involves assigning part-of-speech tags to each word in the sentence. This identifies the grammatical role that the word plays in the sentence. Examples of possible part-of-speech tags include nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and pronouns. 

5. Named entity recognition: Next, Intel.AI uses named entity recognition (NER) to identify and classify named entities found in the feedback. These entities could be people, organizations, locations, times, percentages, monetary values, and quantities. By classifying these entities, Intel.AI can analyze the impact of certain aspects of the feedback on different segments of the market. 

6. Sentiment Analysis: Within NLP, there exist several methods for detecting the emotional tone behind a text, including positive, negative, neutral, and mixed emotions. Intel.AI uses this approach to determine whether the feedback is providing positive, negative, or neutral sentiment towards the product/service being reviewed.

7. Key phrase extraction: Lastly, Intel.AI uses key phrase extraction techniques to identify important phrases within the feedback. By selecting relevant keywords, Intel.AI can highlight areas where additional information might be needed to make effective business decisions.

These seven steps constitute the core operations performed by Intel.AI when dealing with customer feedback, and they allow it to extract valuable insights from feedback that can inform future decision-making.


# 4.Practical Examples of How Intel.AI Uses NLP to Extract Insights From Customer Feedback

Now that we have covered the basics of NLP and how Intel.AI uses it to extract insights from customer feedback, let's take a deeper dive into how it can be applied to solving real-world problems. Let's consider two practical cases:

1. Customer Satisfaction Surveys: A typical task for organizations is conducting customer satisfaction surveys to gather feedback on their products and services. With insight extracted from these surveys, organizations can identify areas where improvement is necessary and target those opportunities accordingly.

2. Market Research: Another area where NLP can help organizations gain insights is market research. Customers may be interested in exploring new products and services but may lack the time or expertise required to do so themselves. By analyzing customer feedback, Intel.AI can identify potential opportunities and recommend suitable solutions that meet specific customer needs.

Both of these examples demonstrate how Intel.AI can apply NLP techniques to extract insights from customer feedback, allowing them to improve their performance and outcomes across multiple domains.
