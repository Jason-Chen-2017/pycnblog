Dynamic convolution (DC) is a new type of convolutional neural network that operates on video sequences in an attention-based way. It can learn complex spatio-temporal patterns by considering both past and future visual contents as contextual cues. 

DC has been applied to many applications such as action recognition, object detection, speech recognition and natural language processing. The paper [9] describes how DC works under the hood and how it achieves state-of-the-art performance for these tasks. In this article, we will describe the basic ideas behind DC and its operation on videos. We will also present some related work that can be used as references or inspiration for further research in this area. Finally, we will implement a dynamic convolution model from scratch using PyTorch library and demonstrate its application to action recognition task on UCF101 dataset.

## 1.背景介绍
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become one of the most popular deep learning models for image classification tasks. However, their power comes with its computational cost which makes them unsuitable for large scale video analysis tasks like action recognition, motion prediction, etc. Among various approaches to address this problem, two promising ones are recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs). RNNs use sequential data and can capture temporal dependencies among frames. LSTMs exploit this property and enable them to better handle inputs with variable length sequences.

However, recent advancements in CNN architecture make them more powerful than traditional models. For example, ResNet, DenseNet, SENet, EfficientNet, and MobileNet provide great improvements over traditional architectures such as VGGNet, AlexNet, GoogLeNet. These models can process high resolution images at high frame rates efficiently. Similarly, significant progress has been made in computer vision algorithms for dealing with videos. Popular techniques include optical flow estimation, supervised and self-supervised learning, and video representation learning based on dense features. Despite these advances, there is still a need to find efficient ways of capturing complex spatial relationships between consecutive frames. This is where Dynamic Convolution (DC) comes into play.

Dynamic Convolution was proposed in [1]. DC is similar to regular convolution but it takes into account not only the current input feature map, but also the surrounding neighborhood of the same size. This allows it to consider past and future visual contents as contextual cues to improve the accuracy of predictions. To achieve this, DC uses a set of keyframes obtained from the video sequence, and then applies attention mechanism on each pixel to selectively focus on relevant frames. Moreover, when training the model, DC adds additional loss functions to encourage the consistency across different parts of the video clip during training, leading to better generalization ability. In summary, DC is a novel approach that combines CNNs with video understanding techniques to significantly improve efficiency and accuracy of video analysis tasks.

### 2.1 Video Processing
Video processing refers to all aspects involved in extracting information from moving pictures and generating multimedia content such as movies, television shows, and digital photos. There are several important areas of video processing including: 

1. Video acquisition: involves methods for capturing and recording live events and digitizing analog signals into digital form so they can be stored or processed later.

2. Video coding/decoding: encodes raw digital video signal(s) to produce compressed media files for storage or transmission. Common video codecs include MPEG-2, H.264, and DivX.

3. Video editing: includes tools for manipulating and combining multiple video clips to create new material.

4. Video compression: reduces the amount of space required to store and transmit digital video by applying lossy encoding methods.

5. Video analysis: involves processing videos to extract useful information about the subject or event being shown. The output could be text or audio tracks or numerical values derived from the video stream.

In order to perform any kind of video processing, computers require specialized hardware and software tools called video processors. Typical components of a video processor system include graphics processing units (GPUs), integrated circuits, and operating systems. These components combine the functionality of various subsystems, such as decoders, compressors, encoders, and translators, into a unified system. The overall goal of video processing is to convert analog video signals into digital form that can be easily stored, transmitted, edited, analyzed, and displayed. 


### 2.2 Action Recognition
Action recognition refers to identifying what actions humans perform within a video sequence, commonly referred to as "video activity recognition" or simply "activity recognition". The primary objective of action recognition is to classify different types of activities performed by actors in videos into predefined categories. Examples of typical video activities include playing sports, dancing, running, jumping, drinking water, washing dishes, cooking, cleaning up, and swimming. Depending on the level of automation needed, activity recognition could involve analyzing small snippets of video rather than entire videos.

Traditional approaches to action recognition typically rely on handcrafted features extracted from the video frames or models trained directly on the extracted features. These features may include appearance features like edges, textures, and color distributions; motion features like velocity, acceleration, and jerk; and semantic features like scene descriptions or object attributes.

More recently, deep learning-based approaches to action recognition have gained much popularity due to their ability to automatically learn features from raw video data. Deep learning has improved the state-of-the-art performance of action recognition models and led to breakthroughs in image classification, object detection, and speech recognition tasks. 

One challenge faced by modern action recognition models is that they must analyze a wide range of complex behaviors and movements from diverse datasets, often consisting of videos recorded in diverse environments and conditions. To address this challenge, modern models leverage transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies, which allow them to adapt to the specific characteristics of different domains and improve accuracy. Traditionally, the easiest way to collect and label such datasets is through human annotators who spend significant time and effort manually inspecting and labeling every single sample. However, such annotation efforts are expensive and limited by the diversity and quality of available datasets.

To solve this problem, industry has focused on developing large-scale automatic annotations frameworks that generate labels without requiring manual intervention. Two prominent examples of such frameworks are ActivityNet and Kinetics. Both of these projects aim to develop an automated pipeline that generates millions of high-quality labeled samples for a variety of video datasets, such as Youtube and TV series. With such datasets and annotation pipelines, industry organizations can train and deploy advanced deep learning models that outperform manual labeling by far.

In conclusion, action recognition is a challenging task that requires advanced video analytics techniques and machine learning algorithms. Automatic labeling frameworks and deep learning models are emerging as potential solutions, yet their deployment remains challenging because of the lack of standardized evaluation protocols, heavy preprocessing requirements, and technical barriers to entry. Standardization and reproducibility are critical to ensure fair comparison between different approaches and implementations. Therefore, it is crucial to invest heavily in creating robust benchmark datasets and evaluation frameworks that empower the next generation of action recognition researchers and engineers to quickly iterate and compare different models and datasets while ensuring fair results.
