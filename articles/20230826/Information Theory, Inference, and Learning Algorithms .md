# 2. 基本概念术语说明
Information theory is a branch of mathematics concerned with encoding and transmitting information. Information can be represented in various forms such as text, speech, images, videos etc., which require compression and decompression methods. Compression reduces the amount of memory required to store or transmit the information while preserving its original meaning. On the other hand, lossy compression techniques may result in reduction in the accuracy of the original signal.

The goal of information theory is to design coding schemes that allow efficient transmission and storage of arbitrary digital messages subject to certain constraints on redundancy and error-correction capabilities. Three main ideas underpinning information theory include:

1. Entropy: The uncertainty of a random variable can be measured in terms of its expected value or information content known as entropy. High entropy means high degree of uncertainty whereas low entropy indicates uniformity. Shannon’s formula provides us an expression for entropy based on probabilities of outcomes:

    H(x)=-∑p(i)*log_2*p(i), where p(i) represents probability of outcome i. 

2. Mutual information: Measures the amount of information shared between two random variables. It quantifies how much knowing one of the variables helps in predicting the other. A widely used measure of mutual information is Kullback–Leibler divergence which measures the difference between the joint distribution of X and Y and their marginal distributions P(X) and P(Y). We use logarithmic units instead of bits for this calculation:

    I(X;Y)=H(X)-H(X|Y), where H(X|Y) is conditional entropy of X given Y.
    
3. Bayes' rule: Bayes’ rule provides a way of updating prior beliefs based on new evidence. Let X denote our hypothesis, and let Y denote our observed evidence. Then, we update our prior belief as follows:

    Posterior=New prior x Likelihood / Sensitivity function, where New prior is obtained from old prior and updated likelihood and sensitivity functions are given by Bayesian rules.
    
Markov chains represent a set of states and their transition probabilities. Hidden Markov models model sequences of observations that have latent structure. Neural networks consist of interconnected layers of nodes representing input features, weights assigned to each connection, activation functions applied at each node, and output predictions. Reinforcement learning algorithms learn policies based on rewards and actions taken during interactions with the environment. Deep learning refers to artificial neural networks with multiple layers, especially suited for handling large datasets.

Clustering algorithms group similar objects together into clusters while ignoring irrelevant variations within the same cluster. Principal component analysis (PCA) projects multidimensional data onto a smaller number of principal components while retaining maximum variance. Unsupervised learning techniques, such as k-means, support vector machines (SVM), and deep learning, provide powerful tools for exploratory data mining tasks.

# 3. 核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解
The book starts by reviewing basic probability theory and statistical mechanics before going through some of the most commonly used probability distributions. The first few chapters then focus on topics like entropy, mutual information, Bayes' rule, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and stochastic optimization. These methods are central to many aspects of natural and social sciences such as genetics, epidemiology, finance, and economics. The next chapters discuss advanced techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), kernel density estimation (KDE), and support vector machines (SVMs). The last part of the book focuses on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Each section presents detailed proofs of mathematical properties and includes examples of code implementation.

Some of the key points covered in this book are:

1. Basic probability theory: Covers basics of probability distributions, expectation, and conditional probability. Includes tables, graphs, and exercises illustrating important concepts.

2. Statistical mechanics: Introduces thermodynamics and statistical physics, including heat capacity, entropy, partition function, Boltzmann's equation, and phase transitions. Provides intuitive explanations of physical phenomena such as Brownian motion and Gross-Pitaevskii equation.

3. Entropy: Describes the concept of entropy and provides a formula for computing the entropy of a discrete or continuous variable. Explains different types of entropy including self-information and mutual information.

4. Mutual information: Introduces the concept of mutual information and explains its role in communication systems. Demonstrates how to compute mutual information using the information bottleneck method.

5. Bayes' rule: Demonstrates how to derive Bayes' rule in various situations such as classification, prediction, and filtering. Uses Bayes' rule to solve coin flipping problem and showcase limitations of the approach.

6. Markov chains: Introduces the concept of Markov chains and discusses different variants of Markov chains such as discrete-time Markov chains, continuous-time Markov chains, and hybrid Markov chains. Also introduces algorithms such as MCMC for sampling from the stationary distribution of a Markov chain.

7. Hidden Markov models: Discusses the idea behind hidden Markov models (HMM) and shows how they can be used for sequence modeling tasks such as speech recognition and natural language processing. Demonstrates the Viterbi algorithm for decoding the most likely state sequence corresponding to an observation sequence.

8. Neural networks: Presents a brief overview of neural networks and how they can be trained using backpropagation. Introduces popular types of neural network architectures such as feedforward networks, recurrent networks, convolutional networks, and recursive networks.

9. Reinforcement learning: Introduction to reinforcement learning and shows how agents can interact with the environment and learn to make optimal decisions based on feedback. Covers the four fundamental RL problems - policy gradient, value iteration, Q-learning, and actor-critic methods.

10. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Describes what are GANs and why they have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional supervised learning approaches. Demonstrates the power of GANs by generating novel images and audio samples.

11. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL): Builds upon knowledge gained in earlier chapters to introduce deep RL algorithms such as deep Q-networks (DQN) and multi-agent RL. This involves training several agents simultaneously to play competitive games and solves the challenges involved in dealing with non-stationarity in the environments.
