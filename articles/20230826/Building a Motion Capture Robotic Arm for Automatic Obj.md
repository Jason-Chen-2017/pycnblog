# 1.简介
  
  
In this article, we will be discussing about how to build an artificial intelligence powered robotic arm that can perform automatic object manipulation tasks like pick and place or real-time grasping of objects with high accuracy using motion capture technology. We will also discuss the importance of various factors such as calibration, sensing capabilities, computational power and performance optimization while building such systems. This is achieved by analyzing different computer vision techniques used along with kinematics equations to achieve reliable and accurate movements. The author has deep knowledge on AI and machine learning technologies, including image processing, object detection, tracking, segmentation, neural networks, reinforcement learning, motion planning and path planning algorithms, etc., which makes it easier to comprehend and implement these technologies into our system design. Overall, this article aims at providing a comprehensive guideline on how to approach the problem of creating a motion capture robotic arm that performs automated manipulations using visual information for applications such as industrial automation, industrial processes automation, warehouse management, healthcare, etc.  

This article assumes readers have a good understanding of mechanical engineering concepts, linear algebra, physics, and programming skills. It also requires the reader to possess some basic knowledge of artificial intelligence principles, deep learning architectures, and software development practices. These are not assumed in this paper, but they help ensure optimal implementation of the described ideas. 

The goal of this project is to provide insights into the challenges faced when attempting to create a real time capable automated object manipulation system using motion capture technology. By working through examples and explanations, the authors hope to provide clear guidance and solutions that enable others to apply their knowledge towards building similar systems quickly and effectively.

  ## Plan your blogs
  
  Start by defining your target audience, choose what you want to write about. Below are some steps to follow:
  
  1. Identify your target audience  
     - Who is interested in reading your blog?
     - Do they know anything about the topic you plan to write about? If not, why should they read your blog? 
     - What interests them most about the subject matter you cover?
    
  2. Choose the topic/problem you want to address  
  
  3. Define your intended purpose of writing your blog
  
  4. Write a brief introduction highlighting your target audience, problem definition, and intentions. This section should set up the tone of your blog and introduce the reader to the content ahead of your longer, technical explanation.
  

  5. Gather relevant materials and resources. Check out online sources like Wikipedia and industry journals to find relevant research papers or articles that support your argument. You may also consult books, courses, and tutorials to further enhance your content.  

  6. Structure your blog post. List all the sections and subsections you’ll include before diving into details. This helps keep your readers engaged throughout your entire article.

  7. Begin writing! Now that you have identified your target audience, chosen the topic/problem, defined your blog's purpose, gathered the necessary resources, and structured your blog post outline, it's time to start writing your first paragraph. Don't worry if something seems daunting at first. Remember, blogging is a collaborative process and it takes practice to get better at it. Keep at it until you're confident and comfortable with your article.  

  8. Publish your article. Once you've finished writing your first draft, test it thoroughly to make sure everything looks correct. Then, submit it for review and edit if necessary. Finally, once the edits are complete, publish your article.
