## ACM MM 是什么？
The ACM International Conference on Multimedia (ACM-MM) is the premier forum for presenting and discussing multimedia technology research with a focus on applications, design, development, and evaluation of new media systems. The conference provides an excellent opportunity to share ideas and developments in these areas with a broad audience. This is especially true given the significant role that recent advances in computer science, artificial intelligence, networking, video processing, and data analytics have had in enabling new forms of digital media production and consumption. The ACM-MM seeks original contributions, high-quality papers, and engaging discussions that advance research and application development within multimedia technology. Papers at this meeting cover a wide range of topics including: visualization, mixed reality, immersive environments, social media analysis, mobile computing, digital libraries, entertainment computing, game engines, hardware architectures, content delivery networks, augmented/virtual reality, privacy and security, and more.
## ACM MM 有哪些主题？
Multimedia Techniques and Applications covers a wide range of technical topics related to multimedia technologies, including but not limited to image processing, audio processing, graphics, modeling, virtual reality, mobile and wireless communications, human-computer interaction, network protocols, web search, multimodal interfaces, content management, and distributed computing. In addition, the track "Crowdsourced Video Analysis" focuses on methods, tools, and techniques for analyzing large collections of videos collected from online platforms such as YouTube or Twitter, using automated crowdsourcing systems. And finally, the Special Issue on Fusion and Interaction proposes papers that address issues associated with fusion and interactive multimedia systems, such as spatial reasoning, user modeling, and haptics. Overall, the conference has multiple tracks and working sessions dedicated to specific subtopics of interest, all of which are highly interactive and stimulating.
