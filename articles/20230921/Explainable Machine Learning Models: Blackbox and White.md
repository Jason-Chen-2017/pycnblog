Explainable machine learning (EML), also known as interpretable artificial intelligence (XAI), is an emerging field in the field of artificial intelligence that seeks to develop explainable models through techniques such as feature importance analysis or counterfactual explanations. These EML approaches aim at explaining how a model arrived at its prediction by revealing its inner workings, enabling trustworthy decision-making under different contexts, improving robustness against adversarial attacks, and serving as a foundation for developing more human-like AI systems capable of cooperating with humans.

In this article we will explore two main paradigms for building EML models, namely blackbox and whitebox methods. We will first discuss what are the key challenges associated with these methods, followed by some basic concepts and terms used in the context of XAI. Next, we will then focus on two popular algorithms widely adopted in the literature – LIME and SHAP – which provide solutions to address each challenge using their own approach based on Shapley values and local surrogate models respectively. Finally, we will demonstrate how to apply both LIME and SHAP in practice using Python libraries like scikit-learn and interpret-community, thereby illustrating their use case scenarios. 

This paper aims to serve as a comprehensive guide for researchers and practitioners alike interested in exploring new avenues in XAI, providing a comprehensive framework to understand various algorithms and approaches used to build explainable machine learning models. The article should enable readers to appreciate the significant role XAI plays in ensuring responsible, transparent, and ethical use of technology.

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terms
## 2.1 Feature Importance Analysis (FIA)
Feature importance analysis (FIA) is one of the earliest attempts to measure the important features of a supervised learning problem. It works by evaluating the impact of individual features on the predictive performance of a model. The FIA method involves calculating the correlation between the target variable and each input feature, and identifying those features whose influence on the output has been greater than average. This information can be useful for understanding why a particular outcome was predicted. However, it does not take into account the interactions among multiple features and may overestimate the importance of certain features in situations where they play a critical role in determining the final outcome. 

To improve upon FIA's limitations, several extensions have been proposed. One of them is called permutation importances, which computes the increase in accuracy that results from randomly shuffling a feature column during training. By averaging the permutations across all possible orderings, a global feature ranking can be obtained, which takes into account all possible interdependencies between features. Another extension is called partial dependence plots (PDPs), which visualize the marginal effect of changing a single feature while holding other features constant. PDPs offer insights into how a feature affects the prediction function, but cannot capture non-linear dependencies between pairs of features. 

## 2.2 Counterfactual Explanation (CX)
Counterfactual explanation (CX) refers to analyzing the causes behind a specific decision made by an AI system. In contrast to conventional explanations, CX focuses on describing the actual event leading up to a decision rather than just reporting the reasons why the decision was taken. A counterfactual explanation describes a scenario that could have led to similar outcomes if certain assumptions were changed. CX offers several benefits compared to traditional explanations including rigorous causal reasoning, transparency, and falsifiability. Additionally, several techniques have been developed to generate CX explanations, such as policymaking tools, causality diagrams, and concept drift explanations. Despite their popularity, however, CX remains relatively limited due to the difficulty in formulating mathematical equations that directly map inputs to outputs. 

The next generation of XAI techniques attempt to bridge the gap between FIA and CX, by introducing hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of both methods. These include LIME and SHAP, which we will briefly introduce below.  

## 2.3 Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) 
Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) is a fast and scalable algorithm designed specifically for XAI tasks. LIME produces detailed local explanations by generating perturbation samples around a given instance and feeding them into the trained model. Lime selects only the top K features deemed most relevant by the model, applies perturbation on those features individually, measures the change in the output caused by each feature change, and returns a set of explanations representing the relative importance of each selected feature. LIME uses linear regression as the underlying model to estimate feature importance scores, making it computationally efficient and easy to implement. Moreover, LIME can handle multiclass problems and categorical variables without requiring any special treatment.

## 2.4 SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)
Shapley value-based explanations (SHAP) is another promising technique for XAI tasks. Unlike LIME, SHAP generates global explanations by computing Shapley values, a game-theoretic approach that assigns credit to players in a coalition when selecting items. The goal of the game is to maximize total reward obtained from coalitions, subject to constraints imposed by external factors such as group size or fairness criteria. Each player contributes a value proportional to his contribution to the overall score, giving rise to the SHAP value estimator. Moreover, SHAP handles interaction effects by considering the joint distribution of feature combinations, allowing it to better represent complex relationships between features. To compute SHAP values efficiently, SHAP approximates the original model’s predictions using a simpler and faster model called a surrogate model. As a result, SHAP provides accurate and reliable explanations for various types of ML models, including deep neural networks and tree-based models.

Therefore, in summary, FIA and CX play essential roles in XAI, but are limited by their lack of direct mapping between inputs and outputs. On the contrary, LIME and SHAP provide powerful ways to extract local and global explanations from black box models. Although LIME requires explicit specification of the number of features to consider, SHAP estimates the importance of features automatically, yet gives more fine-grained control to the user. Overall, combining the strengths of both methods allows us to achieve precise and robust explanations, especially suited for real-world applications.
