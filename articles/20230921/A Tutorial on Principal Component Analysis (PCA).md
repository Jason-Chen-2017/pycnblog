# 1.简介
  

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used technique for data preprocessing in various fields such as machine learning and pattern recognition. It is often used to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional data by selecting only those components that contribute most significantly to variance within the dataset. By reducing the number of dimensions, we can obtain a more compact representation of the original data while preserving its most important features. PCA has many practical applications, including image compression, text clustering, and financial portfolio optimization. In this tutorial, I will provide an overview of PCA from basic concepts and terminology through advanced topics like kernel methods and non-linear PCA.

In summary, the main objectives of this article are:

1. To introduce readers to the field of principal component analysis and explain key terms and concepts.

2. To present the mathematical foundations behind PCA, including eigendecomposition, singular value decomposition, and matrix operations.

3. To demonstrate how PCA works using Python code examples.

4. To explore recent advances and challenges in applying PCA to real-world problems.

5. To offer guidance on choosing the appropriate application scenario, algorithm parameters, and evaluation metrics.

## 2.1 数据集
A dataset is a collection of observations or samples arranged in rows and columns. The rows represent individual entities or instances, while the columns contain attributes or features about each entity. For example, consider a dataset consisting of employee records with attributes such as age, gender, salary, job title, education level, and experience. Each row represents an individual employee, and the columns capture their demographics, job history, performance ratings, etc. Datasets can be divided into two main types depending on whether they have continuous or categorical variables: 

1. Continuous datasets: These consist of numerical values without any discrete categories. Examples include stock prices, temperature measurements, and survey responses.

2. Categorical datasets: These consist of discrete variables where each variable takes one of a limited set of possible values. Examples include customer satisfaction ratings, diagnosis codes, and movie genres. 

## 2.2 模型
The goal of principal component analysis (PCA) is to find a low-dimensional representation of a high-dimensional dataset that retains most of the information in the dataset while minimizing redundancy. We assume that there exists a linear mapping function between the input and output spaces, which maps each point in the input space onto a point in the output space. Mathematically, the problem can be formulated as follows: given a set of $n$ observed points $\mathbf{X}=\{\mathbf{x}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{x}_n\}$, let $\mathbf{Z}$ be an unknown transformation of these points defined by some matrix $\mathbf{W}\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$. Our task is to identify the optimal transformation matrix $\mathbf{W}$ that maximizes the variance of the transformed data $\mathbf{Z}$. This means finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the transformed data, and then selecting the $k$-eigenvectors corresponding to the largest $k$ eigenvalues to define our new feature subspace $\mathcal{Z}_k$. Here, $\mathcal{Z}_k$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^m$, and it consists of the top-$k$ eigenvectors of the transformed data along their associated eigenvalues.

To understand what PCA is doing, let's start with a simple example. Consider the following three-dimensional dataset:

$$\mathbf{X}=
\begin{bmatrix}
  x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\
  x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \\
  \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
  x_{1000} & y_{1000} & z_{1000}
\end{bmatrix}$$

Suppose we want to transform this dataset into a lower-dimensional space without losing much of the information. One approach could be to simply select the first two principal components ($k=2$) and discard the third dimension:

$$\begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{Z}&=\mathbf{X}\mathbf{W}\\
        &=\begin{bmatrix}
          x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\
          x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \\
          \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
          x_{1000} & y_{1000} & z_{1000}
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
          w_{11} & w_{12} \\
          w_{21} & w_{22} \\
          \vdots & \vdots \\
          w_{m1} & w_{m2}
        \end{bmatrix}\\
        &=\begin{bmatrix}
          z_{11} & z_{12} \\
          z_{21} & z_{22} \\
          \vdots & \vdots \\
          z_{1001} & z_{1002}
        \end{bmatrix},
\end{aligned}$$

where $\mathbf{W}\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ is a $(m\times n)$-matrix of eigenvectors corresponding to the highest two eigenvalues of the sample covariances $\Sigma = (\frac{1}{N-1}\mathbf{X}^\top\mathbf{X})^{-1/2}$. Note that the resulting $\mathbf{Z}$ now has only two columns, representing the projection of the original data into the new feature space spanned by the first two principal components.

In general, we seek to choose the best rank-$k$ approximation of the data $\{\mathbf{z}_{i}: i=1,\ldots,n\}$ to minimize the reconstruction error:

$$\|\mathbf{X}-\mathbf{ZW}\|^2_{\text{F}}=\sum_{i=1}^n \left(\left(x_i-\sum_{j=1}^m w_{ij}z_{ij}\right)^2+\left(y_i-\sum_{j=1}^m w_{ij+m}z_{ij}\right)^2+\left(z_i-\sum_{j=1}^m w_{ij+(m-1)m}z_{ij}\right)^2\right),$$

where $\|\cdot\|_{\text{F}}$ denotes the Frobenius norm of a vector, and the sums run over all $m+1$ entries in each row of $\mathbf{W}$. When $m=n$, this reduces to ordinary least squares regression. However, when $m<n$, the solution may not exist since there may not be enough degrees of freedom to recover all $n$ unobserved inputs. Thus, we typically require additional constraints on $\mathbf{W}$ such as sparsity and nonnegativity.
