## 2.1 Types of FDI Techniques
FDI techiques can be classified broadly into two categories - traditional methods and deep learning-based approaches. Traditional methods involve computer vision techniques such as edge detection, template matching, and color histograms while deep learning-based approaches leverage artificial neural networks (ANN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and recurrent neural networks (RNN). Traditional approaches have gained popularity due to their simplicity and efficiency, while deep learning-based approaches offer state-of-the-art performance with less computational complexity. 

### Traditional Methods
Traditional FDI techniques include simple but effective image processing techniques such as edge detection, feature extraction, and object recognition. These techniques work best under ideal conditions where lighting is uniform, background scenes are clear, and facial structures do not move significantly. However, they may fail under diverse scenarios where different types of illumination, reflective surfaces, occlusions, and motion blur occur. Therefore, advanced image processing techniques like deep learning should be considered if high accuracy is required.

### Deep Learning Approaches
Deep learning-based FDI involves training ANNs, CNNs, and RNNs on large amounts of labeled data that includes multiple attributes such as face shape, pose, and expression. The models learn to extract meaningful features from these inputs that can be used for face recognition tasks. There are several deep learning architectures that can be employed for FDI tasks including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). CNNs are widely used for image classification tasks, while RNNs are commonly used for natural language processing and time series prediction. GANs are becoming increasingly popular for generating realistic synthetic faces. Although recent advancements in deep learning-based FDI techniques demonstrate impressive results, the main challenge still remains in terms of scalability, robustness, and interpretability. 

## 2.2 History of FDI Techniques
In the early days of FDI, human faces were detected using handcrafted detectors based on properties such as nose length and jaw width. Over time, computers started incorporating computer vision algorithms to improve the accuracy of FDI techniques. In the mid-90's, researchers began developing deep learning-based algorithms that could accurately identify human faces in images at scale. By the end of the 21st century, the most accurate FDI techniques available are those built upon deep learning. Despite the improvements made over the past decades, there are still significant limitations in FDI technology, especially when it comes to practical deployment of FDI systems in real world environments. Nevertheless, the advantages of deep learning in FDI offers promising avenues for its continued growth and application in various domains. 

# 3.Key Algorithms for Detecting and Identifying Faces
## 3.1 Haar Cascades
Haar cascades are a well-known algorithmic approach for face detection that uses mathematical formulas to create a cascade of simple classifiers for each region of interest within an image. Each classifier evaluates whether a particular pixel meets certain criteria, indicating whether it belongs to a specific area of interest. The result is a binary output indicating whether a given region is likely to contain a face or not. The basic idea behind Haar cascades is to train a cascade of simple classifiers by feeding them positive examples (i.e., photos containing faces) and negative examples (i.e., photos without faces). As the network learns to discriminate between the two classes, it becomes increasingly confident about areas that look like faces. Eventually, the entire image can be scanned by the cascade and any regions deemed to contain faces are labeled accordingly. 

The Haar wavelet transform is also a common technique used in conjunction with Haar cascades for face detection. It reduces the input image size by effectively breaking down the image into smaller blocks and extracting local features using filters. The resulting subimages are passed through the Haar cascade for evaluation. To achieve good accuracy, tuning the filter parameters and adjusting the number of cascades is crucial. Additionally, filtering out non-face areas of the image before applying the Haar cascade can reduce false positives and enhance overall performance. 

However, Haar cascades have some drawbacks compared to other face detection techniques. They require specialized hardware and are limited to small, fixed sized objects (i.e., faces). Additionally, Haar cascades suffer from low precision and recall rates because the spatial constraints placed on individual features prevent the creation of highly complex models capable of representing fine detail in an image. Nonetheless, Haar cascades are widely used in the field of computer vision due to their simplicity and speed. 

## 3.2 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are one type of deep learning architecture that are specifically designed for image analysis tasks. Unlike traditional ANN models, which typically consist of fully connected layers, CNNs use pooling layers to gradually reduce the spatial dimensions of the input image. This allows the model to focus on global features rather than local ones, reducing computational costs. CNNs are often trained on large datasets with hundreds of thousands of images per category, allowing them to generalize better to new situations. One of the most successful applications of CNNs for face detection is Google’s Facenet project. Facenet is a convolutional neural network developed by Google Research that has achieved very high accuracy on the ILSVRC 2013 competition.

Another advantage of CNNs is their ability to adapt to variations in lighting, pose, and expression, making them suitable for handling real-world challenges such as cross-view expressions and viewpoint changes.

However, CNNs have some shortcomings compared to traditional methods for face detection. For instance, CNNs are generally slower and more memory intensive than traditional methods, requiring GPU acceleration or optimized implementations on specialized hardware. Furthermore, even slight movements or orientation changes in the face will cause the network to struggle to recognize the correct face, leading to false negatives. Moreover, CNNs are sensitive to partial occlusion and missing parts of the face, potentially leading to misclassifications. Consequently, additional post-processing steps like merging overlapping predictions can help improve the accuracy of face detection.

## 3.3 Local Binary Patterns (LBP)
Local Binary Patterns (LBP) is another traditional method for face detection that employs a sliding window approach to identify features in images. LBP works by computing the gradient magnitude and direction of pixels surrounding a central point, then comparing these values against predetermined threshold values to produce binary outputs. Specifically, LBP defines four adjacent pixels around a central point and assigns a binary value to each according to whether they are brighter or darker relative to the center pixel. An extension of LBP called Multi-scale LBP (M-LBP) combines local binary patterns generated at different scales to capture both edges and corners in addition to sharp transitions. M-LBP can greatly increase the sensitivity of the detector and handle more difficult cases such as glasses or reflections caused by imperfections in the optics. 

While LBP does perform well in practice, it requires extensive parameter tuning and preprocessing steps to achieve high accuracy. Additionally, the gradients computed by the algorithm are relatively coarse, limiting the amount of information captured. Another limitation is that LBP cannot distinguish between frontal and profile faces, necessitating a second stage of verification using a face landmark detector or pattern recognition. Overall, although LBP has become outdated due to its low precision and recall rates, it remains useful for benchmarking and prototyping purposes.
