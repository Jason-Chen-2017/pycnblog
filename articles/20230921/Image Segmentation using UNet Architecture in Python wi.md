Image segmentation is a fundamental problem in computer vision that involves dividing an image into multiple regions or segments based on some semantic characteristics such as color, texture, shape, and content of the objects within them. This can be used for various applications including object recognition, video analysis, medical diagnosis, and augmented reality. In this article, we will implement the popular U-Net architecture in Python using TensorFlow and Keras to segment images into different regions of interest. We will also discuss about how to train our model and apply it to new data sets. Finally, we will test our algorithm on real world datasets to see its performance.

Before going forward let's quickly understand what is Image Segmentation? It is the process of partitioning an image into disjoint and non-overlapping regions, called segments or superpixels, which represent different classes or functions in the original image. These segments are useful in many computer vision tasks such as object detection, tracking, and depth estimation. The goal is to identify these segments automatically without manual intervention by applying appropriate clustering techniques like K-means or agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms. Once we have identified the segments, we can perform various image processing operations such as classification, edge detection, and morphological transformations. By understanding the basic concept behind image segmentation, we will then move on to explore the core algorithm U-Net and its implementation in Python using TensorFlow and Keras.
