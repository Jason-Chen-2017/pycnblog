Factor Analysis (FA) is a statistical technique used to model multivariate data by unifying the variation among multiple variables into common factors. It's commonly applied in various fields such as marketing, finance, healthcare, social sciences, biology, and other scientific disciplines. However, there are several advantages and limitations of FA that make it an important tool for analyzing complex data sets. In this article, we will explore the main ideas behind factor analysis and present its applications in different contexts. We will also go through the basic theory behind FA and summarize some key properties that distinguishes it from other techniques like principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, we'll discuss the challenges associated with using FA in practical settings and suggest ways to overcome these obstacles.

In summary, the purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of factor analysis including the reasons why it has been widely adopted despite its shortcomings compared to PCA. The author will describe both the theoretical underpinnings of FA as well as its application in real-world scenarios. This will help readers understand how the method works and when it may be suitable for their specific problems. Additionally, the reader will gain insights on potential pitfalls and limitations of FA, which they can use to identify areas where further research is needed before applying it to new data. Within each section, the author will explain step-by-step what needs to be done to perform various tasks, such as data preparation or variable selection, and illustrate with examples and diagrams to demonstrate how the methods work. By the end of the article, the author will have an understanding of the fundamental principles underlying factor analysis and be able to apply them effectively to solve a wide range of problems in practice.

# 2. Basic Concepts
## 2.1 Introduction to Factor Analysis
Factor Analysis is a statistical method developed by Karl Pearson that aims to extract the most meaningful patterns or factors that govern a set of observed variables. This involves identifying groups of related observations based on shared characteristics that are confounded due to measurement errors or latent variables. These groups are then referred to as “factors”. The process of finding factors helps to uncover hidden relationships within the dataset while accounting for noise and making inferences about population parameters. 

## 2.2 Principle Components Analysis (PCA) vs. Factor Analysis
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is another statistical technique that accomplishes similar goals to factor analysis but at a higher level of abstraction. Here’s a brief comparison:

1. Similarity between variables: Both PCA and FA involve extracting information from a matrix of observed variables by decomposing it into linear combinations of its constituent components. However, the core idea behind both techniques is quite different. While PCA is focused on explaining the variance explained by each component, FA focuses more on capturing the intrinsic interrelationships between the original variables. For example, if two variables are highly correlated together, PCA may only capture one of those effects. On the other hand, FA would consider both directions of correlation and extract the joint effect. 

2. Objective function: While both methods attempt to extract a low-dimensional representation of the original variables, they differ in terms of their optimization objective. PCA seeks to maximize the total variance in the resulting decomposition, while FA tries to find a lower-dimensional structure that explains the maximum amount of variance possible across all extracted factors. 

3. Assumptions: In addition to similarity between variables and optimization objective, PCA assumes that the variables are normally distributed, which simplifies the problem of estimating the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. Further, PCA requires manual feature selection prior to running the algorithm, which limits its flexibility. Therefore, PCA often outperforms FA in terms of interpretability and accuracy for certain types of datasets.

## 2.3 Main Ideas Behind Factor Analysis
Factor Analysis involves a three-step procedure:
1. Find a set of unobserved latent variables that best explain the variation in the observed variables. 
2. Use this set of factors to transform the observed variables into a reduced-dimensionality space. 
3. Determine the optimal number of factors to retain based on the desired tradeoff between explained variance and number of factors.

The first step involves modeling the variations among the observed variables as a mixture of independent latent factors, typically represented by means and variances. Typically, the factors are interpreted as dimensions of variation that cannot be directly observed. The second step involves projecting the observed variables onto a reduced-dimensionality subspace defined by the selected factors, and represents the data in a compressed form that captures the essential features of the original data without revealing any individual detail. The third step involves choosing the optimal number of factors to keep based on the tradeoff between explained variance and redundancy. One approach is to select the number of factors that corresponds to a cumulative threshold of significant eigenvalues, after sorting the corresponding eigenvectors by their magnitude in descending order.

## 2.4 Properties of Factor Analysis
One critical property of Factor Analysis is that it identifies latent factors that are common to many variables rather than simply capturing random variations. Moreover, factor analysis uses Bayesian inference to estimate the parameters of the model automatically and provides a probabilistic interpretation of the discovered factors. Together, these properties allow factor analysis to handle high-dimensional data efficiently and accurately. Some additional benefits include:
- Factors estimated by FA capture the covariance structure of the observed variables and do not rely on explicit feature selection procedures. 
- The identified factors capture the underlying causal relationships between the variables and hence enable interpretations beyond their isolated effects.
- FA enables efficient estimation of the factors and supports inference and prediction capabilities.
- Many important statistical tests, including hypothesis testing, likelihood ratio tests, and regression analysis, can be performed easily on the estimated factors.
