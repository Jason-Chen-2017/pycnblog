Artificial Intelligence (AI) is playing a significant role in today’s society and has many applications in various fields such as finance, healthcare, transportation, e-commerce, banking, marketing, retail etc., but it also brings challenges to organizations or individuals that are using AI for decision-making. 

In this blog post I would like to explore the use of artificial intelligence by social managers who are working in various industries across different countries. The article will provide a comprehensive review of four important modes that have emerged in recent years: 

1. Robotic Process Automation (RPA): This is an advanced technology which enables non-technical staff to automate repetitive tasks without any human intervention. It can be used for managing day-to-day operations like data entry, sales execution, order processing, customer service support, accounting, project management etc.

2. Conversational AI: Conversational AI refers to natural language understanding capabilities that allow machines to understand what people say through text inputs and generate appropriate responses on their behalf. These abilities enable chatbots and virtual assistants to interact with users via speech, text, and visual interfaces.

3. Intelligent Decision Making Framework (IDMF): IDMF is a set of tools, frameworks, and technologies designed to optimize business processes based on AI algorithms and insights derived from big data analysis.

4. Data Science & Analytics: Data science involves developing methods and models to analyze large amounts of complex data sets to gain insight into patterns, trends, and relationships. Big data analytics helps organizations make more efficient decisions by analyzing large volumes of unstructured data, generating actionable insights, identifying new opportunities, and improving existing processes.

Based on my personal experience as an AI practitioner and a co-founder of an AI start-up company, these four modes offer exciting possibilities for businesses to revolutionize how they work, collaborate, and communicate with customers. In conclusion, the advancement of these four modes are driving the future of AI in business, particularly for organizations involved in high-stakes decision-making and crucial activities such as supply chain management, payment systems, fraud detection, and risk management. 

This article presents a systematic and rigorous overview of the essential concepts, techniques, and architectures required for implementing each of the above mentioned modes effectively and efficiently. It provides practical examples and best practices to help readers understand the potential benefits of adopting one mode over another, and identifies critical considerations when implementing these modes within organizational cultures and ecosystems.

Overall, I hope this article will serve as a useful resource for researchers, policymakers, designers, developers, and other stakeholders interested in advancing the state-of-the-art in artificial intelligence applied to social management. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or concerns about the content or format of the article. 

Thank You!  





# Introduction 

The growing need for automation and decision-making has led to an explosion in the number of AI tools, services, platforms, and products being developed every year. Despite its widespread usage, little attention has been paid to the impact that AI could bring to organizations across multiple sectors. Artificial Intelligence (AI), also known as machine learning (ML), is defined as “a computer program that learns and improves through experience.” One aspect of AI that plays a crucial role in social management is robotic process automation (RPA). RPA uses software bots or virtual assistants to complete repetitive tasks without the involvement of a human operator, making it a powerful tool for streamlining processes and automating workflows. However, the implementation of RPA solutions can pose unique challenges due to the complexity of real-world problems encountered in the field of Social Work. 

Conversational AI builds on top of natural language understanding (NLU) technologies to create chatbots and virtual assistants that can understand spoken phrases, intentions, contexts, and emotions of humans. These AI agents can respond in person, online, or both depending on the context of conversation. Chatbots can increase efficiency, improve customer engagement, and reduce operational costs while enabling employees to focus on higher-level, strategic tasks. Furthermore, companies that invest in building conversational AI solutions can derive tangible benefits like increased brand loyalty, improved user satisfaction, and reduced training costs compared to traditional approaches. 

Intelligent Decision Making Framework (IDMF) is a framework that aims at optimizing business processes based on AI algorithms and insights derived from big data analysis. The core principles behind IDMF include leveraging structured data, integrating diverse sources of information, and applying advanced statistical and mathematical methods to derive valuable insights from large datasets. By creating value streams that emphasize self-service, continuous improvement, and effective collaboration between subject matter experts (SMEs) and IT teams, businesses can benefit from improved decision-making and better outcomes.

Data Science & Analytics involves developing methods and models to analyze large amounts of complex data sets to gain insight into patterns, trends, and relationships. Big data analytics allows organizations to make more efficient decisions by analyzing large volumes of unstructured data, generating actionable insights, identifying new opportunities, and improving existing processes. With the advent of cloud computing and mobile devices, businesses can now access vast amounts of unstructured data stored on the internet, which requires novel methods and technologies to extract meaningful insights and drive innovation. Thus, organizations can take advantage of Data Science & Analytics to deliver exceptional outcomes that exceed expectations.  

To summarize, RPA, Conversational AI, IDMF, and Data Science & Analytics represent four critical modes that leverage AI to enhance social work functions. Implementing these modes successfully can lead to significant improvements in business performance, positive externalities, and economic returns for SMEs and IT teams alike.
