One of the most exciting things about working in open source software is being able to contribute your skills and knowledge to a project that is widely used by millions of people every day. However, it can also be challenging if you don’t have enough time or energy to keep up with all the changes that are happening at the same time. 

To help stay on top of these changes and make sure you do not fall behind, one way to manage your free time while working on an open-source project is to take some time each week to review what has been happening recently within the community. Here's how you can make this process easier and more effective:


# 2.Open Source Software Community vs. Professional Development Community
It's important to understand the difference between the two types of communities when evaluating whether or not a contribution would benefit your career and development as an individual contributor. In both cases, you need to approach different parts of the community and gain their feedback and input to improve yourself. 


In terms of the **open source software community**, you will interact with other developers who share your interests and hobbies, such as sharing your thoughts and ideas on technical topics related to programming languages, frameworks, tools, and projects. You may also meet fellow developers who want to work together on a specific issue or bug, or participate in online forums where you can learn from others' experiences and insights. These interactions are essential for building new relationships and learning from experts in the field. On the flip side, there are often limited resources available for paid positions in the open source world, so keeping up with changes and keeping pace with industry trends is essential. 


In contrast, the **professional development community** offers structured programmes designed specifically for professional development, including courses, seminars, certifications, and conferences. These events provide practical training in areas like leadership, management, communication, teamwork, coding, problem-solving, and mentoring. The focus is less on creating value for the community but rather on gaining skills that are necessary to become successful professionals. This type of community typically includes experienced individuals who have gone through rigorous training programs and know best practices for developing high-quality software products. 


By understanding the differences between these two types of communities, you'll be better equipped to evaluate potential contributions and choose which ones suit your personal needs and goals. Ultimately, it comes down to empathy and curiosity - the ability to connect with others, listen carefully to feedback, and engage in thoughtful conversations about challenges and solutions.

# 3.Managing Your Free Time
When managing your free time, it's crucial to prioritize tasks that require attention and dedication. Taking care of family responsibilities, working out regularly, and maintaining healthy habits (e.g., exercise) can all help you get the most out of your time while working on open-source projects. To ensure that you're spending quality time on open-source contributions, here are some recommendations:



## 3.1 Schedule Recurring Contributions
Taking part in recurring activities, such as writing blog posts, answering questions on StackOverflow, reviewing pull requests, responding to issues, or speaking at meetups, can help you build a reputation for contributing to open-source projects and create a positive impression in your local community. If you schedule regular contributions, consider taking breaks during the day to give yourself time to focus on your work without distractions.


## 3.2 Set Goals and Track Progress
Setting clear goals can help you stay on track and motivate yourself to stay committed to your open-source contributions. It can also serve as a reference point to see how well you've achieved them over time. Comfortable with disappointing results? Take action to improve your strategy or approach to encourage success.


## 3.3 Set Expectations High and Be Realistic
You should set realistic expectations for how long it might take to complete a particular task, especially if you plan to make multiple small contributions throughout the course of the year. Keep in mind that nobody is going to ask you to write code on Fridays or Saturdays, so it's worth considering ways to adjust your plans accordingly. Similarly, if you find yourself falling behind, try to let your boss, colleagues, or manager know why you might be slowing down, even if they don't agree with your progress.
