# 1.简介
  

Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a pre-trained model on a large dataset (e.g., ImageNet) is used to solve new tasks that are similar or related to the original task at hand. In this paper we will talk about transfer learning for computer vision tasks and specifically focus on fine-tuning a pretrained neural network using PyTorch library in Python language. We will also cover topics like data augmentation techniques, loss functions, hyperparameter tuning, feature extraction techniques etc., which are commonly required in computer vision problems. Finally, we will discuss how to use transfer learning effectively and guide you through an example problem of image classification with CIFAR-10 dataset. 

# 2.背景介绍
Computer vision has been one of the most popular fields in recent years due to its high impact in various applications such as self-driving cars, surveillance systems, robotics, and autonomous vehicles. In these applications, we need to detect objects, recognize actions performed by humans, identify faces and so on. However, building models from scratch can be time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, transfer learning is widely adopted in computer vision research and industry because it allows us to train models on large datasets and then apply them to smaller but related tasks.

In general, transfer learning involves three main steps: 

1. Feature Extraction: Extract features from the pre-trained model based on specific layers or channels. For instance, VGG-19 and ResNet architectures both have convolutional layers that learn abstract representations of visual images such as edges, textures, shapes, colors, and objects.

2. Fine-tune Model: Use the extracted features to train a small fully connected layer added to the end of the pre-trained model. This step consists of unfreezing some of the earlier layers of the pre-trained model, training them alongside the newly added layer, and updating their weights during each iteration.

3. Test/Deploy Model: Once the fine-tuned model achieves good performance on the target task, deploy it in real-time application to handle new inputs.

In our article, we will only focus on fine-tuning a pre-trained neural network on a different dataset, hence focusing on step 2 above. Additionally, we will explore several important concepts associated with transfer learning, including data augmentation, loss functions, hyperparameter tuning, and feature extraction techniques. These aspects help improve the performance of finetuned models on a variety of computer vision tasks.

We will implement two key algorithms involved in fine-tuning a pre-trained neural network using PyTorch library in Python language. The first algorithm is called "Data Augmentation". It refers to adding artificial variations to the input images to increase the diversity of the dataset and reduce overfitting. The second algorithm is called "Loss Function" and refers to the optimization function used to minimize the difference between predicted output and actual label. Here's a summary of what we will do:

1. Introduction

Before diving into detailed explanation, let’s start with a brief introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs).

  - What are CNNs?

  - How they work?

  - Types of CNN Architectures

    - VGG
    - AlexNet
    - GoogLeNet
    - ResNet
    - DenseNet


To fine-tune a pre-trained CNN architecture, we need to extract its learned features from different layers and then add a few more layers to form a customized classifier. We typically freeze the weights of all the layers except the last few ones (which contain the classification blocks), retrain those last few layers with a new dataset, and then test the resulting model on the target task. To achieve better accuracy, we adjust the hyperparameters of the model using techniques like dropout regularization and early stopping. During fine-tuning, we may also want to experiment with different activation functions, filter sizes, strides, pooling size, batch normalization, weight initialization schemes, and other hyperparameters.

The following subsections explain the basic terms and operations involved in implementing transfer learning for object detection, face recognition, and image classification tasks using CNNs.  

## Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs)

### What are CNNs?
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of deep neural network designed to process and analyze raw image data. A CNN consists of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, with the goal of learning complex patterns and relationships present in the input data. Each node takes input from a local region of the input image, applies a set of filters, and outputs a transformed signal. As the network processes the image data, it builds up a representation of the underlying structure and semantics. Different types of neural networks exist, including convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and long short-term memory networks, among others.

Convolutional layers in a CNN take inspiration from the visual cortex, which performs spatial filtering of visual stimuli. In each layer, the neurons project incoming features onto lower dimensional representations, thereby reducing the dimensionality of the input. The number of filters applied to the input signals controls the degree of complexity captured by the network. The pooling layers in a CNN downsample the output of previous layers to reduce computational load and limit overfitting. Dropout regularization and max-norm constraints further prevent overfitting.

### How they work?

Convolutional neural networks consist of layers of feature detectors arranged in sequences, followed by pooling layers. Each feature detector learns a set of filters that activate when it encounters particular types of visual features, thus creating a hierarchical pattern recognition system. The final stage of the CNN contains a fully connected layer, which uses the activations of the previous layers to compute scores for each class label or pixel location. The ability to capture multi-scale contextual information and make robust predictions makes CNNs well suited for natural language processing, speech recognition, and medical diagnosis. 

For our purposes, understanding how CNNs work under the hood is not necessary since we can simply use pre-built libraries like Keras and TensorFlow to build our own models. Nevertheless, here's a simple walkthrough of how to create a CNN using Keras library in Python:

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Activation

model = Sequential() # initialize sequential model 
model.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3,3), padding='same', activation='relu', input_shape=(224,224,3))) # Add first conv layer
model.add(MaxPooling2D((2,2))) # Add pooling layer
model.add(Flatten()) # flatten output for dense layer
model.add(Dense(units=1024)) # Add dense layer
model.add(Activation('relu')) # ReLU activation
model.add(Dropout(0.5)) # Add dropout layer
model.add(Dense(units=num_classes, activation='softmax')) # Add output layer with softmax activation

# Compile model with categorical crossentropy loss function and adam optimizer
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

This code initializes a sequential model, adds four layers to it, compiles it with categorical cross entropy loss function and Adam optimizer, and sets its initial configuration. The model starts with a convolutional layer of 32 filters with a 3x3 kernel size and same zero padding, followed by a relu activation and max pooling layer. Afterwards, the output is flattened for feeding it into the next dense layer, which acts as a hidden layer. Another dense layer of 1024 units and a relu activation follow, before applying a dropout layer to randomly drop out some neurons during training to prevent overfitting. Finally, an output layer with softmax activation is added to predict the probabilities of each class label. Compiling the model ensures that the loss is calculated correctly while updating the parameters of the model using backpropagation.

Now that we've covered the basics behind CNNs, we can move forward to discussing transfer learning methods and how to use them to enhance the performance of our models on different computer vision tasks.
