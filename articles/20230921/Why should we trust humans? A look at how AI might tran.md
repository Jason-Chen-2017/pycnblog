With the advancement of technology over the past decade, our lives have become increasingly interconnected with machines and artificial intelligence (AI). We have become dependent on these technologies to accomplish tasks that were previously thought impossible or even unimaginable. This trend has also created a new form of media that is heavily influenced by automation and virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa and Cortana. As a result, people are becoming increasingly technophobic and fearful of using human-like interfaces for most tasks. In this article, I will explore what it means to trust humans in a world where AI takes control of every aspect of life.

## 2.1 What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?  
  
  
Artificial Intelligence refers to any system that exhibits consciousness, intelligent behavior, reasoning, problem solving, learning abilities, and general intelligence. It can be defined as “the ability of a machine to simulate human cognitive processes”[1]. This definition includes several other features such as language comprehension, perception, planning, decision making, etc., which makes it more comprehensive than simply computational power alone. Therefore, when talking about Artificial Intelligence, one needs to understand its scope beyond just computational power.  

One way to categorize AI systems is based on their architecture, which defines how they process information and make decisions. There are four main categories of AI: Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Robotics. 

### Machine Learning
  
Machine Learning algorithms use statistical models to learn from data and improve performance over time without being explicitly programmed. The core idea behind machine learning is to build programs that can identify patterns in data and then apply those patterns to solve problems automatically. Popular examples of machine learning applications include spam filtering, image recognition, speech recognition, fraud detection, natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and recommendation engines.  

In recent years, many researchers have proposed different types of machine learning methods, including neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees, clustering, and reinforcement learning. These techniques enable machines to recognize complex relationships between inputs and outputs, often through large amounts of labeled training data. Researchers are also working to develop advanced deep learning architectures capable of handling very high-dimensional input datasets, with millions of parameters. 


### Natural Language Processing 
  
Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves the ability of machines to understand and manipulate human languages. NLP is widely used in chatbots, text analytics, sentiment analysis, and knowledge base construction. The goal of NLP is to analyze unstructured textual data and extract relevant insights, providing valuable information to users and businesses. Some popular tools used for NLP include NLTK (Python library), spaCy (open-source tool), Stanford CoreNLP, and Apache OpenNLP. 

To perform well in natural language understanding tasks, machines need to possess the ability to reason, synthesize, and integrate various linguistic concepts. To do so, machines typically use techniques such as part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, named entity recognition, and topic modeling. For instance, given an email written in English, a machine may need to classify the message into a set of predefined categories, such as personal emails, job application, financial transactions, and marketing campaigns. 


### Computer Vision
  
Computer vision involves the ability of machines to interpret visual images and capture meaningful representations. Applications of computer vision include object detection, face recognition, autonomous driving, surveillance, and medical imaging. Machines rely heavily on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and object detection. CNNs work by scanning through parts of the image sequentially, applying filters, and aggregating results to produce a final output. Convolutional layers allow CNNs to detect spatial relationships between pixels, while pooling layers reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps and preserve important features. Other advances in computer vision include self-supervised pretraining, few-shot learning, and adversarial attacks. 


### Robotics
  
Robotics involves the design, development, testing, and operation of robots that can sense, act, communicate, and interact with the real world. Examples of current uses of robotics include industrial automation, healthcare delivery, manufacturing, and entertainment. Unmanned vehicles (UVs), drones, and quadcopters are some notable robotic platforms. Traditional robotics involves task-specific motion primitives that move robots to specific locations, avoid obstacles, pick up objects, and deliver products. With advances in machine learning and computer vision, robotics will continue to evolve towards a hybrid approach that combines multiple techniques to achieve higher levels of accuracy and efficiency. 



## 2.2 How does AI affect culture and society?

The term "artificial intelligence" was coined in 1956 by American psychologist Geoffrey R. Farkas as a response to the limitations of human brains. However, throughout the last two decades, AI has been rapidly growing in importance and usage within various fields and industries. Here are five major areas where AI affects culture and society:



1. **Education**

   Artificial intelligence has revolutionized education through automated grading systems, virtual tutoring software, and adaptive assessment tools. Virtual teachers can provide students with individualized feedback on their assignments, enabling them to practice critical thinking skills before moving on to the next assignment. Moreover, computers are able to read and analyze student essays quickly, improving grades and reducing workload for teachers. Ultimately, this shift toward AI-powered education is expected to transform classrooms and schools into more collaborative spaces where students engage in less structured study sessions, communicating ideas and answering questions in real-time.

2. **Healthcare**
  
   Advances in medicine have led to the rise of artificial intelligence in the field of healthcare. Machines can diagnose diseases faster and more accurately, leading to significant improvements in patient care. AI-powered diagnostic tools can evaluate patients’ symptoms and collect relevant test results, significantly reducing costs and errors associated with traditional medical procedures. Furthermore, machines can take advantage of vast amounts of clinical data to make predictions and recommend potential treatments, optimizing treatment options for each individual patient. Finally, AI can contribute to early identification and management of disease before it becomes aggressive or fatal, ensuring greater safety and quality of life for everyone involved.

3. **Government**
  
   Artificial intelligence is increasingly being integrated into government operations. This shift enables governments to automate routine processes and streamline decision-making. Governments are leveraging AI to enhance public services, improving transparency, efficiency, and customer satisfaction. A typical example of how governments are using AI is with facial recognition technology used during election season to ensure fair voting rights and prevent corruption. While this technology is still in its infancy, it represents a significant step forward in improving democracy across the country.

4. **Social Media**
  
   Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter are evolving rapidly due to the emergence of artificial intelligence-powered bots. Bots are responsible for interacting with users via online chats, sharing posts, and replying to comments, among other functions. Many social media platforms claim to have developed their own versions of bots, but this comes with risks since bots may behave maliciously or purposefully distract away from real conversations. Nonetheless, bot development offers opportunities for governments, organizations, and companies to leverage AI for good. For instance, Facebook has recently started experimenting with automated advertising to encourage political engagement. Similarly, Google has partnered with several companies to create self-driving cars powered by AI. Overall, the impact of AI on social media platforms will depend on how these platforms change their content moderation policies and user interface design.

5. **Economy**
   
   Although there is no single cause of economic growth, modern day economies are clearly shaped by AI. AI-powered applications like Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri facilitate convenient shopping, voice assistance, and weather forecasting. The rise of digital payments and wireless banking has also driven the demand for improved payment processing speeds. This push for increased efficiency and speed has allowed banks to invest in enhanced security measures and upgraded infrastructure to handle the massive volumes of transactions occurring today. By combining AI-powered technologies with big data collection and analysis, economic growth can be accelerated exponentially.
   
However, all of these factors come with challenges. The spread of misinformation, rising concerns around privacy, and concerns regarding ethics and bias are particularly problematic for artificial intelligence and its applications across these domains. The regulatory environment must continuously monitor and update AI strategies to ensure they remain beneficial, safe, and appropriate. Despite these challenges, the prospect of better living through artificial intelligence presents an exciting opportunity for individuals and organizations alike.
