Nanostructured materials (NSMs) have emerged as an essential technology in the acceleration of advanced energy devices such as superconductors, magnets, and neutron sources. They are characterized by high electrical conductivity, low density and mass, and very thin structures that can be formed by a variety of techniques such as growing on single crystals or layered arrays. This makes NSMs ideal candidates for accelerating electronics with high power densities and large fields of view, such as those required for fusion energy applications. However, due to their extremely thin structure, they present unique challenges in handling, fabricating, operating and maintaining them reliably. In this article we will explore the use of nanostructured materials for accelerator structures and devices, highlighting the different types of nanostructures and how they impact device performance, safety, design, and manufacturing aspects. 

In addition, this article presents several novel methods for forming nanowires and dielectrics from NSM coatings using traditional physical principles, as well as theoretical modeling approaches that can help guide experimental researchers towards more efficient and reliable device development. We also discuss the potential role of smart materials technologies in these applications and suggest future directions for advancements in this area.

## 3.1 Nanostructure Definition
A nanostructure is a self-assembled and oriented stack of two or more type-matched unit cells. The elements within each unit cell are interconnected through interface regions that define the boundaries between them. A nanostructure can be composed of individual atoms or molecules, or it may be constructed out of macroscopic patterns of multiple atoms or molecules arranged in specific configurations. Common examples include metamaterials made of polymeric chains linked together along braided bonds, soft solids formed by patterned arrays of van der Waals atoms, heterogeneous multilayer networks composed of graphene sheets or graphene lattices embedded in silicon wafers, etc. Each class of nanostructure has its own distinctive properties that make them particularly suitable for certain application areas. Some common classes of nanostructures include: 

1. Metallic Nanomaterials: These are semiconductor-based systems consisting primarily of metallic nanoparticles that interact electrically and magnetically. Examples include wire-wound alloys such as multiferroic films, MnSb and SnS nanowires, ZnO nanorods, and AgCu/AgAu slab nanocomposites.

2. Polymer Based Multilayers: These are nanostructured materials consisting of polyelectrolytes (PEG), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAs). PEG multilayers consist of long chain hydrocarbons that are chained together at interfaces where they bond to form parallel planes of material. PTFE multilayers are similar but consists of a thick sheet of fluorene particles with overlapping ends that act like spacings. PVAs are made up of vinyl groups attached to an amorphous scaffold that forms layers above and below it. These multilayers can be used to construct electronic devices such as solar panels, photovoltaic cells, graphite-based composites, and microfluidic channels.

3. Layered Heterojunction Composites: These are hierarchical composite structures consisting of alternating phases of bulk and nano-sized films. Each phase is surrounded by a porous structure that allows air flow to pass freely throughout. Examples include cathode coated TiN/SiC heterojunctions, perovskite/chromium oxide composite membranes, MoS2/MoSe2 SQJTs, graphene based biomedical sensors, and layered zinc oxide oxides.

4. Patterned Multifilaments: These are nanostructures formed by repeated layers of highly ordered segments such as DNA. They typically exhibit nanoindentation effects, which occur when small sections of a substrate undergo a change in shape during growth. Examples include gold nanobeads, silver nitride surfaces, and platinum nanochannels.

Each category has various degrees of complexity ranging from simple repeating units to complex multiscale multilayers and even tensile engineered geometries. As mentioned earlier, the goal of any nanostructure is to achieve high electrical conductivity, low density and mass, and effective manipulation of light and matter. It is important to note that some materials may not perform optimally without proper processing steps, temperature control, and maintenance.

## 3.2 Types of Coatings
The fundamental characteristic of all nanostructured materials is their ability to bind other materials or molecules together through interfacial reactions. Coatings are one means of introducing nanostructural features into a substrate. There are three main types of coatings: 

1. Direct Coating: A direct coating involves adsorption of the coating onto the surface of a host material followed by reaction of the reactive species inside the surface with the functional groups in the coating. For example, gold nanobeads can be directly deposited on a substrate by immersing the substance into a solution of Gold (111) sulfide and KOH. Alternatively, direct organic coatings can be applied to build up biofunctional shells around the target objectives. The advantage of direct coatings over semi-direct mechanisms is that they allow greater control of the process parameters, including pH, moisture content, and chemical composition. Additionally, direct coatings may have lower costs than indirect ones because fewer chemicals need to be added to the system.

2. Semi-Direct Mechanisms: Another way to introduce nanostructural features into a substrate is through the use of semi-direct mechanisms such as spray painting or inkjet printing. These processes rely on specialized paints or printing agents that can modify the underlying surface chemistry before binding with the nanostructure. For instance, a UV resin can be injected into a photoresist layer and then reacted with the active site of a polymer to provide both thermal stability and selectivity. Other technologies such as miniaturized inkjet printers can print submicron scale features with finer resolution and greater flexibility compared to conventional photolithography techniques.

3. Surface Engineering Methods: Finally, there are many other ways to apply nanostructured materials to surfaces, including injection molding, etching, sputtering, and gradual curing. These methods involve techniques such as slow feedrate extrusion or rolling bed flattening to deposit the desired nanostructures. Depending on the method chosen, the final product can be quite versatile, from a nanospheroidal particle array to a synthetic gap that encapsulates a material to create a transparent insulating layer. Additionally, surface engineering methods may offer better compatibility with existing optoelectronic and optical components while still retaining strength and durability advantages. Overall, the choice of coating technique will depend on factors such as the nature of the nanostructure being employed, the intended application, and personal preferences.
