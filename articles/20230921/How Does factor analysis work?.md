The Factor Analysis (FA) is a statistical technique that analyzes the relationship between multiple variables and identifies the underlying structure or patterns in those data. The goal of FA is to find linear combinations of observed variables such that these combinations explain most of the variation in the observed data while minimizing any redundancy among them. In other words, factors capture the common components of the observed variables that may not be easily identified from the original data directly. This process provides an alternative way to analyze complex datasets and identify hidden relationships within them. 

Factor analysis is often used for multivariate analysis in various fields such as engineering, biology, psychology, finance, marketing, etc. It has many applications across different industries like healthcare, social sciences, industry research, transportation planning, design, etc. In this article, we will focus on how FA works with simple examples. We will use Python programming language to implement basic steps of FA algorithm.

3. Algorithm Steps - Discuss important points related to FA algorithm including steps involved in loading data, computing covariances and correlations, calculating principal components using SVD decomposition, choosing number of principal components, interpreting results and visualizing data.

# 2.Basic Concepts
Before diving into the details of FA algorithm let’s understand some fundamental concepts associated with it.<|im_sep|>
## Variance & Covariance Matrix
Variance measures the degree of spread of values around the mean of a set of numbers. It can be calculated by finding the average distance between each point in the set and the mean value. Higher variance indicates that the distribution is more spread out. A high variance means that the values vary widely, whereas low variance means they are tightly clustered around the mean value. Mathematically, variance is defined as follows:<|im_sep|>

$Var(X)=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n{(x_i-\mu)^2}}{n}$ where $n$ is the number of observations and $\mu$ is the population mean. 

Covariance describes the degree of similarity or dissimilarity between two variables. When two variables tend to move together, their covariance is positive; when they tend to move apart, their covariance is negative. If one variable increases without affecting the other, their covariance becomes zero. The covariance matrix represents all pairwise variances between all variables in a dataset. Mathematically, covariance matrix C is given as:<|im_sep|>

$\text{Cov}(X,Y) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i-\bar x)(y_i-\bar y)}}{n-1}$ where X and Y are random variables and n is the sample size.

Based on above definitions, we have the following properties for variance and covariance matrix:
* Var($a$) + Var($b$) ≥ Var($a+b$)
* Var($ax$) ≤ E(a^2)Var(x)
* if X and Y are independent then Cov($X$, $Y$) = 0

## Eigendecomposition of a Covariance Matrix
Eigendecomposition refers to decomposing a square matrix into a product of matrices consisting of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. An eigenvector of a square matrix is a non-zero vector that satisfies the equation AX = λX, where X is an eigenvector, A is the original matrix, λ is the corresponding eigenvalue. The corresponding eigenvalue gives information about the nature of the eigenvector and whether it is positive, negative, or zero. On the other hand, an eigenvalue tells us something about the length of the eigenvector. Eigendecomposition allows us to reduce the dimensionality of our dataset by only keeping the eigenvectors whose corresponding eigenvalues satisfy certain criteria. For example, we could discard small or negative eigenvalues because they do not contribute much to the overall shape of the dataset.<|im_sep|>

To perform eigendecomposition of a covariance matrix, we first calculate its centralized form which involves subtracting the mean of each column from the respective columns. Next, we compute the correlation matrix by dividing the centered matrix by its standard deviation along the diagonal.<|im_sep|>

If M is symmetric and positive definite, then there exists a unique real-valued diagonal matrix D such that MD = AM. Here, D is called the “diagonal matrix” of M, and A is called the “eigenvector matrix” of M. The rows of A are called eigenvectors of M and correspond to the positive eigenvalues of MD. The absolute values of these eigenvalues give us information about the contribution of each eigenvector to the variations in the data. Moreover, the eigenvectors are unit vectors, meaning their lengths are equal to one. Finally, we can sort the eigenvectors by descending order of their corresponding eigenvalues to select the k largest ones.<|im_sep|>

Here is a Python implementation of covariance matrix calculation and eigendecomposition based on numpy library:<|im_sep|>

```python
import numpy as np

# Generate random data
data = np.random.rand(10, 2)

# Calculate covariance matrix
cov_mat = np.cov(data, rowvar=False)
print("Covariance matrix:\n", cov_mat)

# Perform eigendecomposition
eigenvals, eigenvects = np.linalg.eig(cov_mat)
idx = eigenvals.argsort()[::-1]    # Sort indices in descending order
eigenvals = eigenvals[idx]         # Sort eigenvalues in descending order
eigenvects = eigenvects[:, idx]     # Sort eigenvectors according to sorted indices

print("\nEigenvalues:", eigenvals)

for i in range(len(eigenvals)):
    print("Eigenvector {}:".format(i+1), eigenvects[:, i])
```
