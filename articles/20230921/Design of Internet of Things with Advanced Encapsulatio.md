The emergence of the internet of things (IoT) has led to an explosion in various applications and services that are able to connect devices together and exchange data through networks. However, designing such a system requires careful consideration of security and privacy issues. This article discusses several advanced encapsulation technologies, including Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), Firewalls, and Network Address Translation (NAT). By leveraging these technologies, it is possible to create secure and private IoT systems while minimizing overhead and management complexity. 

Encapsulation refers to the process of wrapping or encrypting network packets so that they can be transmitted over the public internet without being easily intercepted by malicious parties. The basic idea behind any encapsulation technique is to use encryption algorithms to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access. In this context, encapsulation techniques play a crucial role in ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between IoT devices and cloud servers. 

In this article, we will discuss the following aspects:

1. VPNs - A VPN is a secure tunnel created using IPSec protocol that connects two endpoints over an encrypted channel. It provides strong authentication and prevents eavesdropping and tampering of communication. VPNs can also be used to provide greater bandwidth compared to standard connections over the public internet.
2. Firewalls - A firewall is a layer of software running on a computer network device that filters incoming traffic based on predetermined rules. It can block certain types of traffic, monitor activity and enforce policies for users. Firewalls can help prevent intrusions into the network and maintain security measures. 
3. NAT - Network address translation (NAT) is a method of mapping multiple addresses to a single internal address. It allows multiple devices to share one external IP address and hide the real IP addresses of those devices. Additionally, NAT enables different devices on the same local network to communicate with each other without requiring their direct connection.

We will then demonstrate how these three technologies can be combined to build a robust and scalable IoT architecture that ensures high-level security and privacy guarantees. We will conclude with future research directions and challenges related to IoT security and privacy.

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs):

A VPN is a secure tunnel created using IPSec protocol that connects two endpoints over an encrypted channel. It provides strong authentication and prevents eavesdropping and tampering of communication. VPNs can also be used to provide greater bandwidth compared to standard connections over the public internet.

Firewalls:

A firewall is a layer of software running on a computer network device that filters incoming traffic based on predetermined rules. It can block certain types of traffic, monitor activity and enforce policies for users. Firewalls can help prevent intrusions into the network and maintain security measures.

Network Address Translation (NAT):

Network address translation (NAT) is a method of mapping multiple addresses to a single internal address. It allows multiple devices to share one external IP address and hide the real IP addresses of those devices. Additionally, NAT enables different devices on the same local network to communicate with each other without requiring their direct connection.

VPN Terminology:

Endpoint - One side of the VPN tunnel connecting two devices.

Gateway - The central node of the VPN, responsible for forwarding and routing packets between the endpoints.

Encryption - Encryption is the process of converting plain text data into secret code before sending over the internet. Decryption happens when receiving data back from the sender.

Cryptographic Authentication Algorithms:

There are many cryptographic authentication algorithms available today that ensure the integrity and authenticity of data transferred over a network. Some popular ones include:

1. Message Digest 5 (MD5) Algorithm
2. Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA1)
3. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Cipher
4. Data Encryption Standard (DES) Cipher
5. Triple DES (Triple-DESP) Cipher

VPN Security Measures:

Strong Authentication:

One of the main advantages of using VPNs is its ability to provide strong authentication mechanisms. These mechanisms rely on digital certificates issued by trusted certificate authorities (CA) to verify the identity of both ends of the VPN tunnel. They add another level of protection against hackers attempting to sniff or manipulate communications.

Traffic Inspection:

Another important feature of a VPN is its ability to inspect all traffic passing through the tunnel to detect any suspicious activities or attacks. Intrusion detection tools and alerts can be configured to notify administrators about any potential threats.

Bandwidth Management:

When building larger scale enterprise-class IoT solutions, VPNs offer significant benefits in managing bandwidth usage. This can significantly reduce costs associated with data transfer as well as improve overall performance of the solution.

Firewalls:

Firewalls act as a barrier between the outside world and the inside network. They filter and redirect traffic according to predefined rules. There are different types of firewalls, but common features include functionality like rate limiting, logging, content filtering and blocking malware.

Security Measurements:

Firewalls can be used to measure the security posture of a network. Common measurements include packet loss, throughput, DNS requests, HTTP requests etc. This information can be useful for identifying areas where security measures need to be improved. For example, if there is a large increase in packet loss at a particular location, admins might want to investigate why this is happening.

Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Support:

To support IPv6 devices, modern firewalls must implement IPv6 support. Many commercial vendors have implemented IPv6 support nowadays, making it easier than ever to deploy IPv6-based IoT infrastructure.

NAT:

Network address translation (NAT) is a method of mapping multiple addresses to a single internal address. It allows multiple devices to share one external IP address and hide the real IP addresses of those devices. Additionally, NAT enables different devices on the same local network to communicate with each other without requiring their direct connection.

NAT Types:

1. Static NAT - In static NAT, every device on the network gets assigned an IP address from the NAT gateway. All outgoing traffic from devices uses this fixed IP address to reach the Internet. When responding to incoming traffic, the gateway translates the source IP address to the original device's IP address.

2. Dynamic NAT - In dynamic NAT, each device chooses which port it listens on and forwards all traffic coming from that port to a specific destination IP address/port combination. Since multiple devices may use the same port number, dynamic NAT assigns unique ports dynamically for each device. This makes it harder for attackers to trace individual devices across the network since they don't know the actual source IP address. However, due to random assignment of port numbers, some devices may not always receive responses to their outbound traffic.

3. PAT (Port Address Translation) - Similar to dynamic NAT, PAT involves choosing a fixed port number for each device and translating it to a new unique port number for each outbound connection. Unlike traditional NAT, PAT assigns multiple devices' port numbers to the same translated port, resulting in less network utilization and increased efficiency.

Design Considerations:

1. Scalability - To handle increasing traffic loads, IT organizations should consider deploying redundant gateways and load balancers within the VPN infrastructure. As more devices connect, additional resources can be allocated accordingly to distribute the workload effectively.

2. High Availability - As mentioned earlier, VPNs are designed to remain accessible even in case of failures. Therefore, it is essential to plan for failover scenarios during off-peak hours. Furthermore, operational procedures should be developed to document and track incident reports, escalate issues, and perform regular maintenance checks.

3. Device Management - Managing hundreds or thousands of devices connected over a virtual private network becomes difficult quickly. It would make sense to develop efficient methods for monitoring and controlling device connectivity status and security settings.

4. Compliance Requirements - Many governance and compliance frameworks require strict controls around network access, threat prevention, and auditing. VPNs can serve as a platform for enforcing consistent security practices throughout the organization.
