Phase Separation and Multi-wavelength Electron Microscopy (PSMEM) is an imaging technique that allows us to study different phases of a material at different wavelengths by using multiple electron diffraction patterns with distinct interference fields created by atomic molecules within the sample. By combining PSMEM techniques, we can accurately determine the size, shape, and chemical composition of materials in vivo.
In this paper, we present a novel method for characterizing metals, alloys, and complex porous structures through phase separation and multi-wavelength electron microscopy (PSMEM). We use a unique combination of sterile martensitic alloy (SmA) films with a patterned polyimide layer on top as our test materials. Our approach involves analyzing each individual film separately and then comparing the results to obtain accurate insights into the physical properties of these materials. In addition, we show how PSMEM can be used to reveal hidden structural features such as pore structure or disordered regions, and provide insight into mechanical and thermal response to stress and temperature changes. Finally, we discuss future directions for research in this field and highlight applications of this technology.

2.背景介绍
Phase Separation and Multi-wavelength Electron Microscopy (PSMEM), also known as Strehl ratio analysis or refractive index mapping, has been gaining increasing attention recently due to its ability to study several aspects of metallic and polymer systems in real time without need for any external equipment beyond a camera lens and collimator. The primary advantage of PSMEM lies in its high degree of resolution and selectivity, allowing us to visualize fine details and small crystallographic elements at multiple wavelengths simultaneously. It provides immediate access to the fundamental physics behind optoelectronics principles, making it particularly useful for studying multifunctional materials like metals, polymers, and composite materials formed from those components. However, there are still many challenges associated with PSMEM, including the complexity of sample preparation, data processing, image interpretation, and statistical analysis required to extract meaningful information from the images. To address these issues, numerous advanced tools have been developed to automate parts of the process, but they still require human oversight and expertise to handle the wide range of samples and conditions encountered in real world scenarios. This requires continuous advancement in both hardware and software technologies to meet the ever-increasing demand for fast and cost-effective solutions. 

3.基本概念术语说明
The following sections will briefly describe the basic concepts, terminology, and methods involved in PSMEM. 

## Atomic Scale Model
To understand the basics of PSMEM, let's first go over some common terms and ideas related to atoms and atomistic models:

### Atom
An atom is the smallest unit of matter consisting of a nucleus surrounded by zero or more electrons orbiting around it. An atom consists of three main sub-units, namely protons, neutrons, and electrons. Proton is the positive charge carrier, while neutron is the neutral particle responsible for maintaining equilibrium, and electron is the negative charge carrier that attracts and repels other electrons within the same molecule. Each proton possesses two spin quantum numbers, $I$ and $\theta$, where I denotes the principal quantum number and $\theta$ represents the azimuthal angle between the projection of the proton on the x axis and the line connecting the nucleus and the center of mass of the electron cloud. Neutron has only one quantum number, called the neutron quantum number ($m_n$), which determines whether it interacts with another neutron or an electron. Electrons orbit around the nucleus and are typically classified into either valence or free electron clouds depending on their electrically negativity. Valence electrons occupy the lowest energy levels and play essential roles in bonding molecules together. Free electron clouds, on the other hand, exist below the highest occupied energy level and allow the nucleus to become unpaired with the rest of the electron cloud. During the ionisation process, electrons undergo a series of transitions between valence and free state and generate new electrons until all available electrons have been used up.

### Atomistic Models
Atomistic models are mathematical representations of atoms, molecules, and solids based on discrete mathematical formulas involving mathematical operations such as addition, multiplication, and differential equations. These models predict various properties of materials such as elasticity, thermal conductivity, magnetic permeability, optical absorption, etc., but they suffer from several limitations. First, they do not capture the dynamic nature of reality, leading to erroneous predictions about the macroscopic behavior of the system. Second, they are limited in their spatial resolution since they represent the system at a single point in space at a given moment in time. Third, they cannot account for variations in interatomic interactions that occur during the course of a material’s lifetime. For example, when a metal is exposed to radiation, its local density of states becomes distorted resulting in shifts in the band gap, consequently changing the effective mass of the metal. Although there are ongoing efforts to develop improved computational methods to simulate atomistic models, they still remain very complex and computationally intensive, requiring specialized hardware and expensive simulations to be performed for complex systems.

### Computation
Computation refers to the process of converting input data into output data through algorithms. It involves several stages, including algorithm design, implementation, testing, debugging, optimization, integration, deployment, and maintenance. The key component of computation in PSMEM is the computer program or code that performs the image reconstruction, data analysis, and visualization tasks. There are several programming languages and frameworks available for developing image reconstruction codes, ranging from low-level numerical libraries to high-level scientific computing environments like MATLAB and Python. Popular image reconstruction packages include ALS, SIRT, CCPi-Regularisation Toolkit (C-RTK), and VASP. Numerical libraries like Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and OpenCV are often used for postprocessing and visualization tasks. Post-processing includes calculating statistics, filtering out noise, and segmenting objects. Segmentation algorithms include thresholding, clustering, and texture modeling techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNN). Statistical analysis includes statistical tests like t-tests, ANOVAs, and Kolmogorov Smirnov tests. Visualization tools include plotting libraries like Matplotlib and D3.js, and interactive web-based visualisations like WebGL and Three.js.

## Optical Engineering Principles
Optical engineering principles describe important concepts, processes, and laws that apply to optical devices, components, and systems. They cover topics such as light propagation, wavefront characteristics, lenses, focusing mechanisms, and imaging systems. Here are a few examples:

### Light Propagation
Light propagates through space as waves. Each wave carries a beam of electromagnetic radiation, whose intensity varies with direction, wavelength, and frequency. The speed of light depends on the nature of the medium being traveled through and is usually expressed in meters per second (m/s). When a beam passes through a distance of $d$, the total energy carried by the beam decreases linearly according to the formula

$$\Delta E = \frac{h}{2}c^2 d,$$

where c is the speed of light, h is the Planck constant, and $\Delta E$ is the amount of energy lost along the path.

The most important type of light is visible light, which consists of wavelengths in the range of 400 nm to 700 nm. The intensity of visible light falls off exponentially with wavelength, meaning that as we move away from the sun’s surface, the brightness reduces gradually. Visible light enters the eyes after passing through layers of cells called retina, which filter the radiation and convert it into a signal that can be interpreted by the brain. Retinal photoreceptors, nerve fibres, and blood vessels act as filters and pass on only the desired signals to the central nervous system. The central nervous system sends electrical impulses to muscles, glands, and tissues throughout the body, modulating their functions according to the incoming stimulus. Different types of cells respond differently to light, creating a variety of illuminations that can be studied using PSMEM.

### Wavefront Characteristics
A thin and flat surface can cause light to bend around itself. This effect is referred to as diffraction, causing spots of light to appear focused at specific angles relative to the surface normal. Since diffraction is caused by rapidly varying planar wavefronts, we call them interferometric radiographs. Interferometry enables us to examine the interaction of light waves with surfaces other than the imaging plane. Two waves of opposite polarities that come from separate sources interfere with each other as they propagate towards the detector, producing waves that overlap, displace, or cancel each other, resulting in complex wavefronts. Pattern recognition algorithms can be applied to identify and isolate these patterns.

Diffraction gratings are commonly used in optical microscopy because they produce uniformly illuminated interferograms, allowing us to resolve subtle differences in structure and orientation without damage to the specimen. Among other things, they help to increase the depth of field, enable nondestructive imaging, and reduce artifacts due to speckle. Gratings can also control the illumination power and focus of the objective lens, enabling us to precisely align and manipulate objects under investigation. Optically shaped lenses, such as spherical mirrors and conjugate parabolas, can create highly aberrated waves that obscure diffraction patterns and lead to poor contrast. Furthermore, it may be difficult to remove small particles from the specimen using traditional imaging techniques due to the presence of blurriness and scattering effects introduced by the lens.

### Lenses
Lenses are optical devices that change the perspective of an object, causing it to appear larger or smaller than it actually is. The manner in which a lens works is determined by the focal length, the distance between the lens and the front of the lens, and the diameter of the entrance pupil. The focal length determines the magnification factor of an object. As the focal length increases, the apparent size of an object appears larger; however, it is also less focused and therefore more sensitive to deflection. The choice of lens affects the accuracy, reproducibility, and sensitivity of an experiment. Popular lenses include convex lenses, concave lenses, and astigmatic lenses, which vary in their geometry and curvature. Convex lenses converge onto objects near the front edge of the lens, while concave lenses diverge from them. Astigmatic lenses exhibit pronounced ellipticity and unevenness in their cross-section, resulting in an astigmatism that deforms lines of parallelism or antiparallelism in an image.

### Focusing Mechanisms
Focusing mechanisms are designed to adjust the position of an optical system so that the beam of light is directed toward the desired region of interest. Common focusing mechanisms include piezoelectric crystals, magnetic lenses, and slit lamps. Piezoelectric crystals use permanent magnets embedded in a crystal matrix to vibrate slightly, generating a voltage that moves the crystal tip away from or towards the focus of the lens. Magnetic lenses depend on a magnetic field generated by a coil inserted into the eyepiece to maintain the correct angular focus. Slit lamps rely on a slits placed above or below the lens to direct the light beam toward the desired area. All focusing mechanisms affect the final image quality and reproducibility of an experiment, but certain combinations of choices can limit the possible areas of focus and introduce errors.

### Imaging Systems
Imaging systems combine various components, such as lenses, lasers, filters, viewscreens, detectors, amplifiers, and others, to produce an image of a sample under study. Components such as filters and viewscreens can improve the visibility of bright spots, dim features, and other irregularities in the sample. Viewscreens can be composed of glass, plastic, or organic materials and can incorporate colored fluorescent dyes or transparent covers. Filters optimize the sensitivity of the imaging system by blocking unwanted frequencies or selecting only the desired ones. Amplifiers convert the analogue signal produced by the imaging device into a digital signal that can be processed by computers or stored digitally. Different combinations of components yield unique imaging capabilities and can enhance the performance of an experiment.
