Support vector machines (SVM) are a popular machine learning technique used for classification and regression problems. Despite their popularity, many developers still struggle to choose between linear and non-linear SVMs when building an AI application. This article aims at providing an in-depth explanation of how to decide whether to use linear vs non-linear SVMs based on various factors such as data complexity, decision boundary shape, feature engineering requirements, etc., and why it is important to consider both techniques when building complex systems using deep neural networks. 

In this blog post, we will be discussing several key concepts related to support vector machines, including the basic theory behind them, their working principles, and their practical implementation. We will also discuss different ways to handle nonlinearity issues that can arise due to non-linear relationships between features and the target variable, along with the role of the kernel trick. Finally, we will conclude with an example scenario wherein we use SVMs to classify images into categories and analyze their effectiveness compared to other techniques such as logistic regression, random forests, and deep neural networks. By the end of this article, readers will have a clear understanding of how to select appropriate algorithms for solving real world problems, and they will also gain insights into some of the challenges faced by developers while implementing these techniques. 

This blog post assumes intermediate knowledge of machine learning, statistics, and computer science. It is recommended that readers who are less experienced with these fields refer to external resources like Coursera courses, textbooks, and online tutorials before proceeding with the reading material below. 


# 2.基本概念术语说明
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are supervised machine learning models designed to separate data points into distinct classes or regions. The goal of the algorithm is to find the best hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the two classes. Two well known versions of SVMs are linear and non-linear. In this section, we will briefly explain the basics of each type of SVM and provide some terminology that may not be familiar to every reader.


## 2.1 Linear SVMs
Linear SVMs are simple yet powerful tools for binary classification tasks. They involve finding the hyperplane that maximizes the distance between the separating line and the nearest training examples from either class. Here's how it works:

1. Take input features X and label Y. Each sample point belongs to one of two possible classes, denoted as +1 or -1.
2. Construct a hyperplane passing through the origin and perpendicular to the maximum margin between the classes. Mathematically, let's call this hyperplane H.
3. For each sample x, assign its predicted label y = sign(x.H). If x lies outside of the margin region, then we predict its actual label directly since there is no risk of misclassification.

The optimization objective of linear SVMs is to maximize the margin width, which is defined as the minimum distance between any two samples that lie within the same class. Intuitively, if the margin is wider than necessary, it means that the model has more flexibility to fit the training data and thus could potentially overfit the data. On the other hand, if the margin is narrower than necessary, it means that the model is too constrained and cannot generalize well to new unseen data. To balance these tradeoffs, a regularization term is often added to penalize large margins. 

Linear SVMs work well under certain assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data, namely that the data can be separated linearly. However, the performance of linear SVMs degrades significantly if the distribution becomes more complex, such as curved boundaries or overlapping clusters. Therefore, linear SVMs are commonly replaced by more advanced variants called radial basis functions (RBF) SVMs. 

Some of the common terms used in describing SVMs include:

**Hyperplane**: A hyperplane is a flat surface that passes through the origin. In the context of SVMs, the hyperplane represents the decision boundary, i.e., the line separating the two classes. Common types of hyperplanes include linear planes and higher dimensional spaces.

**Margin**: The gap between the hyperplane and the closest training instances, i.e., the smallest distance between a test instance and the hyperplane. Margin plays a crucial role in determining the ability of the classifier to correctly classify new observations. If the margin is too small, the hyperplane may be too flexible and may not capture all the relevant patterns in the data; if the margin is too large, the hyperplane may miss some critical features that distinguish the two classes.

**Support vectors**: These are the training instances that define the decision boundary. The support vectors are those instances whose margins are maximized during the training process. By definition, only the support vectors can influence the final solution.

**Dual formulation**: The dual formulation allows us to solve the original optimization problem subject to a simpler constraint. Specifically, we want to minimize the cost function C by taking the following steps:

  1. Find a weight vector w* s.t. dot(w*, xi) >= 1 for all i=1 to n_samples (positive weights)
  2. Find a weight vector w* s.t. dot(w*, xi) <= 1 for all i=1 to n_samples (negative weights)
  
   Dot product corresponds to the scalar products in the Euclidean space R^n. Thus, this formula defines a convex quadratic program (QP), which can be solved efficiently by standard QP solvers.

## 2.2 Non-linear SVMs
Non-linear SVMs differ from linear SVMs because they allow for the presence of more complex decision boundaries. One way to achieve this is by adding a so-called kernel transformation to map the inputs into a high-dimensional space where they become linearly separable. There are several kernel functions available, such as Gaussian, polynomial, and sigmoid kernels.

Here's how a non-linear SVM works:

1. Choose a kernel function k(x, z) that maps pairs of inputs into a higher-dimensional space where they are linearly separable.
2. Calculate the inner product of the mapped features K(X, Z) with a weight vector W to obtain the transformed features KW.
3. Train a linear SVM on the transformed features KW instead of the raw features X.

As mentioned earlier, the choice of kernel function determines the degree of nonlinearity allowed in the decision boundary. Some popular choices are the radial basis function (RBF) kernel and the sigmoid kernel. The advantage of RBF kernel is that it implicitly encodes the geometry of the data into the similarity measure. The disadvantage of RBF kernel is that it requires the specification of a bandwidth parameter that balances bias and variance. 

In contrast, the sigmoid kernel uses a smooth and monotonic transformation of the input values to encode nonlinearity. Its primary disadvantage is that it does not give rise to sparse solutions, making it harder to learn complex decision boundaries that depend on local structure.

A further variant of non-linear SVMs called support vector regression (SVR) applies to regression tasks where the output variable takes continuous values rather than discrete labels (+1/-1). SVR finds the hyperplane that minimizes the squared error between the predictions and the true outputs. While SVR shares many similarities with SVMs, it differs in that it involves modeling the output variables as being distributed according to a normal distribution rather than just a piecewise constant function.

One potential issue with using non-linear SVMs is that they can suffer from the "kernel trap", which refers to the phenomenon where the decision boundary learned by the algorithm fails to generalize well to new datasets that exhibit high degrees of correlation. The kernel trick addresses this issue by transforming the data into a higher-dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable without actually computing the transformation explicitly. Instead, it relies on the kernel function to perform the mapping implicitly. This avoids the need to store and maintain a separate copy of the transformed data, reducing memory usage and computational overhead.

## 2.3 The Kernel Trick
The kernel trick is a mathematical technique that provides a simplified view of the computation involved in applying a non-linear transformation to high-dimensional data. The idea is to replace the explicit transformation matrix $K$ with a corresponding kernel function $k$, such that $Kx=\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\phi(Kx)$. Intuitively, the kernel function computes a similarity metric between any pair of input vectors, while the transformation matrix expresses the dependency between the original dimensions. The importance of the kernel trick is that it enables us to apply a wide range of non-linear transformations to the data without having to derive and implement specific algorithms for each case. The key property of a valid kernel function is that it should satisfy the homogeneous polynomial identity:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(\sum_{j=1}^{m} a_{ij} x_j^{q_i}\right)^2 \leq \sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{m}|x_i||x_j|^{q+2}$$

where $a_{ij}$ are elements of a positive semidefinite matrix $A$, $x_j$ and $y_j$ are two input vectors, and $q_i>0$ controls the level of smoothness or curvature. The identity states that any weighted sum of squares of a set of features from a kernel space can be bounded above by a factor proportional to the volume spanned by a sphere of radius equal to the largest L2 norm of the features. Hence, if our kernel satisfies this property, we can assume that any projection of the data onto another subspace that preserves the kernel density will preserve the relative distances among the samples.
