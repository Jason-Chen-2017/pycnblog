# 1.简介
  

Exception handling is a crucial aspect of any programming language that enables the program to handle errors and unexpected situations gracefully without crashing or producing unpredictable results. In this article, we will discuss two approaches for exception handling in Python - try-except block and context managers with their advantages and disadvantages respectively. We will also provide examples of using each approach to illustrate its use case and common exceptions raised during coding. 

In summary, the main points covered are as follows:

1) The basics of exception handling in Python including syntax, hierarchy, built-in exceptions, custom exceptions, raising an exception, catching an exception and finally blocks. 

2) Different ways to implement exception handling using try-except block and context manager, along with pros and cons of each method.

3) Examples of implementing different scenarios using both methods, such as network connectivity issues, file operations, database connections, etc., showing how to handle various types of exceptions thrown by these scenarios.

## 2.1 Exceptions
Exceptions are events or occurrences that occur during the execution of a program that interrupt its normal flow of control. When an exception occurs in a Python program, it causes the current process to terminate abnormally (known as "raising" an exception). When an exception is not handled properly, the program may terminate prematurely and produce unexpected results or crashes. It is essential to write code that handles all possible exceptions and takes appropriate actions to avoid them.

Python provides a built-in mechanism called `try` - `except` block to handle exceptions. This block consists of three parts:
* `try`: This part contains the statements that might raise an exception. If an exception is raised within this part, then the corresponding except clause is executed. Otherwise, the statements after the try block are executed normally.
* `except [exception_type]`: One or more clauses that specify what kind of exception should be caught if it occurs inside the try block. Optionally, you can include another statement which executes when no exception is raised inside the try block.
* `else`: An optional clause that specifies statements to execute if there were no exceptions raised inside the try block.
* `finally`: An optional clause that always executes regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.

A Context Manager is a design pattern used in Python that allows objects like files, sockets, threads, locks, and databases to be used easily in a `with` block. These objects need to implement certain methods to define their behavior. They usually have `__enter__()` and `__exit__()` methods which are used to acquire resources and release them at the end of the `with` block, respectively. By using context managers, your code becomes much simpler and easier to maintain. Here's an example of a context manager in action:
```python
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    contents = f.read()
    print(contents)
```
Here, the `open()` function returns an object that implements the context manager protocol, allowing us to use it in a `with` block to automatically close the file after we're done working with it.

In general, it's recommended to choose either the `try`-`except` block or the context manager depending on the specific requirements of your project and the type of exception being handled. Let's take a look at some other terms and concepts related to exception handling in Python.

### Syntax Error
Syntax error occurs when the parser detects an incorrect statement structure or invalid syntax while parsing a program. For instance, if we forget to add a colon at the end of a line, Python will raise a syntax error saying `"unexpected indent"`. Similarly, if we accidentally pass too many arguments into a function call or reference a variable before assigning it a value, Python will also raise a syntax error. These syntax errors prevent our program from running and must be fixed before we run it again.

To fix syntax errors, check the indentation of the lines of code and ensure that they match the correct syntax. Check for missing commas between list items, parentheses after function calls, quotation marks around strings, brackets for indexing lists, etc.

Common syntax errors include:
* Missing parenthesis after function call. Example: `print("Hello World")` instead of `print("Hello World())`
* Missing colon at the end of a class definition. Example: `class Person` instead of `class Person:`
* Using multiple assignment with tuples but forgetting the comma separator. Example: `(x y z)` instead of `(x,y,z)`
* Indentation errors due to improper spacing or wrong number of tabs/spaces.
