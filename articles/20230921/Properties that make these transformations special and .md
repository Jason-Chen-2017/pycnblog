Modern-day data is often heterogeneous with different types of attributes such as textual, numerical or categorical ones. This raises a number of challenges to the development of efficient algorithms for processing this type of data, which are common across various domains including natural language processing (NLP), social network analysis, image and video processing, bioinformatics and many others. The goal of these techniques is to extract valuable insights from large amounts of unstructured data by analyzing patterns, correlations, relationships among them, identifying outliers etc. These insights can help businesses, researchers, decision makers, policy makers, and even citizens make more-informed decisions. However, it requires a deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, optimization strategies, and software architectures necessary for building efficient, scalable, and accurate systems. In this article, we will discuss some properties of transformations on heterogeneous datasets that are important for designing effective algorithms for processing this type of data. Specifically, we will focus on two key transformations: feature selection and dimensionality reduction. We will start by describing their basic concepts, terminologies, and how they relate to other transformation methods such as normalization, imputation, and discretization. Next, we will explain the underlying mathematical theory behind these transformations along with concrete examples and implementations. Finally, we will conclude by discussing potential benefits and drawbacks of using each transformation method when applied to specific problems.
# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Feature Selection
Feature selection refers to the process of selecting relevant features that are most informative about the target variable. It helps reduce overfitting, improve model accuracy, speed up training time, and promote interpretability of the resulting models. One way to select relevant features is through statistical measures like mutual information, correlation coefficient, or chi-squared test. Other approaches include wrapper methods such as recursive feature elimination or forward selection, where selected features are added one at a time until performance criteria are met. A good balance between these two approaches is typically achieved by combining them together through ensemble methods such as bagging or boosting. 

Dimensionality Reduction
Dimensionality reduction involves reducing the number of dimensions in the dataset while preserving its structure. Common methods include principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). PCA finds the directions that maximize variance in the data, and LDA tries to find a set of axes that maximizes class separability within the data. Once transformed into fewer dimensions, these representations provide a concise summary of the original data space. Some popular applications of dimensionality reduction include visualization, clustering, and pattern recognition tasks. Dimensionality reduction can also be used to reduce the computational cost of machine learning algorithms by compressing high-dimensional input spaces into low-dimensional ones.


Normalization
Normalization is the process of scaling values within a given range to a standardized form, so that all variables have an equal contribution. Normalization can be done using several techniques such as min-max scaling, mean centering/zero-centering, or Gaussian scaling. Min-max scaling scales values between 0 and 1, whereas mean centering shifts the distribution mean towards zero. Zero-centering scales the minimum value of the distribution to zero, followed by mean centering. For continuous distributions, Gaussian scaling normalizes values to unit variance and zero mean. 


Discretization
Discretization refers to the process of converting continuous variables into discrete ones by assigning each unique interval a distinct label. Discretization techniques can be based on frequency counts, entropy, or distance-based partitioning. Frequency counts bin the data points into contiguous intervals according to their frequencies of occurrence, whereas entropy-based methods divide the continuous space into regions based on their local complexity. Distance-based partitioning partitions the data space into k clusters using density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, where k represents the desired number of clusters. 


Imputation
Imputation refers to filling missing or incomplete data values with estimated estimates, usually either mean, median, mode, or predicted values based on other available data. Imputation plays a crucial role in making predictions on new data samples since it addresses the uncertainty associated with incomplete or noisy data. Several methods exist to perform imputation including regression, interpolation, and nearest neighbor imputation. Regression imputation fits a linear regression model between observed and missing values to predict missing values based on non-missing variables, while interpolation imputes missing values by estimating them based on neighboring observations. Nearest neighbor imputation assigns missing values to the observation(s) with the closest available neighbors based on Euclidean distances.

## Feature Selection Methods
### Mutual Information
Mutual information measures the degree of dependency between two random variables X and Y. Formally, it quantifies the amount of information shared by X and Y, after observing all possible joint distributions of X and Y. Higher MI scores correspond to better representations of both X and Y. Mutual information has been shown to be very effective in feature selection due to its ability to capture complex interdependencies and redundancy between features. Popular feature selection methods based on mutual information include: 1) Filter methods such as information gain, relief, and wrapper; 2) Wrapper methods such as sequential backward selection and RFECV; and 3) Ensemble methods such as RF, GBDT, and SVM-RFE. 

The following formula describes the mutual information between X and Y assuming a bivariate probability distribution p(x,y): 

I(X;Y) = −∑p(x)log(p(x)) + ∑p(y)log(p(y)) - ∑p(xy)log(p(xy))

where I(X;Y) denotes the mutual information between X and Y, and log() denotes the base e logarithm function. Given a collection of n independent variables {X1, X2,..., Xn} and a binary target variable y, the mutual information measure provides a powerful tool to identify the subset of features that contribute most significantly to the classification task.

### Correlation Coefficient
Correlation coefficients measure the linear relationship between two variables X and Y, where positive values indicate a strong positive relationship, negative values indicate a strong negative relationship, and zero indicates no relationship. Popular correlation coefficient measures include Pearson’s r, spearman's rho, and kendall tau rank correlation coefficient. Popular feature selection methods based on correlation coefficients include filter methods such as ANOVA F-test, reliefF, and mutual information; wrapper methods such as Sequential Forward Selection, SBS, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE); and ensemble methods such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), and ExtraTrees.

The following formulas describe the correlation coefficients between X and Y depending on whether they are centered or not: 

For centered data:

r=E[(X − μ_X)(Y − μ_Y)] / √Var[X]∙Var[Y]  

For uncentered data:

r=E[(X − E[X])(Y − E[Y])] / √Var[X]∙Var[Y]  ,    Var[X]=E[(X − E[X])²]   

where r denotes the Pearson's r correlation coefficient between X and Y, μ_X and μ_Y denote the sample means of X and Y respectively, and Var[] denotes the population variance. When r is close to zero, there is no significant linear relationship between X and Y, while when r is close to one, X and Y are perfectly positively related. 

### Chi-Squared Test
Chi-squared tests assess the dependence between two categorical variables X and Y. It compares the observed frequencies of the variables to expected frequencies based on the overall frequencies of the categories. More specifically, if the observed frequencies are higher than expected frequencies under the null hypothesis, then the alternative hypothesis is accepted and X and Y are dependent. Popular chi-squared test measures include fisher exact test, Kruskal-Wallis H-test, and Mann-Whitney U-test. Popular feature selection methods based on chi-squared tests include filter methods such as ANOVA, chi-square, and Gini index; wrapper methods such as RIPPER and CART; and ensemble methods such as Bagging, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting.

The following formula describes the likelihood ratio test statistic for testing the dependence between X and Y:

LR=(observed_freqs - expected_freqs)^2/(expected_freqs * (1-expected_freqs)), 

where LR denotes the likelihood ratio test statistic, observed_freqs denotes the actual frequencies of X and Y, and expected_freqs denotes the theoretical frequencies under the null hypothesis. The larger the value of LR, the more likely it is that X and Y are dependent, and vice versa. Popular threshold values for accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis are 5% or 1%.

## Dimensionality Reduction Methods
### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Principal component analysis (PCA) transforms the data into a lower-dimensional space while retaining the maximum information content. The first principal component (PC1) explains the largest proportion of the variability in the data, and each subsequent PC explains additional variances in decreasing order. The direction of the PC corresponds to the eigenvector of the covariance matrix corresponding to the largest eigenvalue. The magnitude of the PC corresponds to the square root of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. By projecting the data onto the first few PCs, we can visualize the data in a compressed form without losing any of the essential features. Popular feature selection methods based on PCA include filter methods such as explained variance, scree plots, and t-tests; wrapper methods such as CUR, BIFS, and ARD; and ensemble methods such as PCA-Forests, Incremental PCA, and Kernel PCA.

The following equation summarizes the PCA procedure:

Z = W^T*X

where Z is the projection of the data onto the reduced space, X is the original data, and W is the rotation matrix obtained by computing the top K eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. The number of components chosen is determined by evaluating the rate of decrease of explained variance vs. number of components included, commonly referred to as the “elbow” rule.

### Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) aims to separate the data into classes while trying to minimize the intra-class scatter and maximize the inter-class separation. The objective is to maximize the difference between the means of each class and minimizing the variance among groups. The direction of the axis that best separates the data into two or more classes is called the discriminant axis. If there are multiple discriminant axes that satisfy the above constraints, then LDA selects the one that results in the smallest difference between the means of the two or more classes. Popular feature selection methods based on LDA include filter methods such as information gain ratios, f score, and chi-squared statistics; wrapper methods such as RDA, QDA, and GDA; and ensemble methods such as Multiple Classifier Systems (MCS) and Maximum Margin Classifiers (MMC).

The following equations summarize the LDA procedure:

μ_j = Σk (Σi=1 -> n x_ik y_ik / Σi=1 -> n y_ik)*y_ij   // Mean vector of class j

Sw = Σk (Σi=1 -> n x_ik x_ik / Σi=1 -> n)*(Σi=1 -> n x_ik y_ik / Σi=1 -> n)*y_ij - Σk (Σi=1 -> n x_ik / Σi=1 -> n)*μ_j*(Σi=1 -> n x_ik y_ik / Σi=1 -> n) -...

Sb = Σk (Σi=1 -> n x_ik x_ik / Σi=1 -> n)*(Σi=1 -> n x_ik y_ik / Σi=1 -> n)*y_ij - Σk (Σi=1 -> n x_ik / Σi=1 -> n)*μ_j*(Σi=1 -> n x_ik y_ik / Σi=1 -> n) -...

Ws = Sw / Sb      // Projection matrix

Wz = Ws*X        // Transformed data

where X is the original data, Wz is the projected data, Ws is the projection matrix, y_ij is the response variable indicating the class membership of the i th observation, and n is the total number of observations. The parameter matrices Sw and Sb are computed from the principle components of the empirical covariance matrix of the original data multiplied by the corresponding linear transformations.
