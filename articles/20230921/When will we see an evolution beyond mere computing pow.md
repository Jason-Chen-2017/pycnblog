Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a hot topic in recent years due to its potential for transforming many industries including healthcare, finance, transportation, energy, etc., but it is still undergoing rapid growth and development. This has led to some misconceptions about AI's capabilities and limitations. In this article, I will argue that we are not yet ready to adopt or embrace artificial intelligence technologies completely until we have seen an evolution beyond mere "computing power," such as full-blown artificial consciousness. 

In order to fully understand what comes next after we have achieved our current levels of capability with AI systems, we need to look beyond traditional computing power into other dimensions of human cognition, such as creativity, reasoning, empathy, social interactions, etc. These characteristics of human intelligence are important in achieving true Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which enables machines to achieve tasks similar to humans while also understanding contextual information and adapting quickly to new situations. Therefore, we cannot ignore these aspects of AGI research as they will play a crucial role in designing robust and comprehensive artificial intelligent systems capable of tackling complex problems and making smarter decisions than ever before. 

The field of artificial intelligence needs to be treated with caution and ethical values because there is no perfect system and each one is designed to solve specific types of problems. Nevertheless, it is essential that we do our best to provide safeguards against exploitation by humans through responsible use of technology, ensuring data security, transparency, accountability, and legal compliance. As technological advancements continue, more and more people will become involved in AI-driven decision-making processes, and it is essential that we create environments where users feel comfortable and supported to exercise their autonomy and judgment. 

As AI becomes increasingly pervasive in our lives and workplaces, critical conversations must be held regarding ethics, fairness, privacy, safety, and responsibility, all of which contribute to improving overall quality of life for billions of people around the world. Whether we are talking about developing or utilizing artificial intelligence in various contexts, it is essential that we treat it with the utmost respect, acknowledging its limitations, rather than using it as a tool for unethical behavior. However, it is never too late to act. We need to continue investing in AI research and education so that we can develop systems that are ethically and socially responsible and can truly help make the world a better place. Together, we can build on our collective experiences and knowledge towards creating a more beneficial future for everyone. 

This article serves as a starting point for further explorations in artificial intelligence. It outlines key concepts, algorithms, technical details, code examples, and insights into the nature of future progress. Its goal is to inspire leaders, policymakers, educators, developers, researchers, and scientists to start thinking critically about the challenges ahead and begin taking action now to address them. Please share your thoughts on how we can meet the challenge of reaching full-blown artificial consciousness within the coming decades and foster responsible and ethical use of AI technologies!
