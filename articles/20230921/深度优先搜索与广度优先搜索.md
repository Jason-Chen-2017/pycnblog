Depth-first search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search(BFS), two of the most famous graph traversing algorithms are used in many computer science fields. In this article, we will discuss how they work and what are their differences. 

DFS and BFS both traverse a graph by searching for all the connected nodes from the starting node or vertices until all the nodes have been visited. The main difference between these two is that DFS visits the deepest possible node first while exploring its neighbors, whereas BFS visits the shallowest possible vertex first before visiting its neighbors. The former algorithm uses recursive approach to explore each branch as long as it finds unexplored nodes. On the other hand, the latter algorithm maintains a queue of vertices waiting to be explored which allows it to process all available vertices at any point of time without using recursion. The traversal order of the output depends on whether the start node is chosen randomly or not. If we choose a random start node, then the order of the traversal may vary due to the nature of depth-first search where we go deeper into the graph before going wider outward. In contrast, if we choose the starting node closest to our target, then Breadth First Search ensures that all its neighboring nodes are processed before moving on to those farther away. Therefore, choosing an appropriate starting node is important when performing searches with these algorithms.

In general, DFS and BFS can find various types of graphs such as trees, DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) and even directed and undirected graphs depending upon the choice of the starting node. However, there are some limitations associated with them, especially in terms of time complexity. DFS has a worst case time complexity of O(|V|+|E|) and BFS has a worst case time complexity of O(|V|+|E|). These limits make them less suitable for large graphs where it would take too much memory space to store the entire graph. Therefore, when working with large graphs, we should use more efficient techniques like iterative deepening or A* search instead of traditional Depth First/Breadth First Search. 

The next sections provide a brief overview of DFS and BFS along with necessary terminology and key concepts needed to understand the core algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate how to implement DFS and BFS with Python code examples. We also provide tips to avoid common pitfalls and limitations of the DFS and BFS algorithms.

2.术语
- Vertex: Vertices represent the individual objects of interest in a graph. They are represented by numbers or characters. 
- Edge: An edge represents the connection between one vertex and another vertex in a graph. It typically consists of a pair of vertices and contains information about the relationship between them such as the weight of the connection or distance between them. Edges can be directed or undirected. Directed edges have a direction from one vertex to another while undirected edges have no specific direction. 
- Path: A path is a sequence of adjacent vertices in a graph that connect two vertices. A single vertex is considered a trivial path consisting of just that vertex. A cycle is a special type of path where the last vertex of the path connects back to the first vertex of the path. 
- Graph: A graph is a collection of vertices and edges that describe relationships between them. There are different kinds of graphs including simple graphs, multigraphs, digraphs, and hypergraphs. 

3.算法原理
## DFS (Depth-first search)
DFS is a simple but powerful algorithm for traversing a graph. It starts from a given source vertex or set of vertices and recursively explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This means that it follows a path as far as possible before backtracking, giving priority to branches closer to the source vertex. The algorithm continues until all vertices have been visited or an end condition is met. Below is the pseudocode for DFS:

```
DFS(graph G):
  mark the current vertex as visited
  for every unvisited neighbor v of the current vertex:
    recursively call DFS on the neighbor vertex
  return
```

## BFS (Breadth-first search)
BFS is similar to DFS except that it works differently than DFS. Instead of following a path as far as possible, BFS visits only the immediate neighbors of the source vertex or set of vertices, and then moves to the next nearest vertex in the same manner. Once all neighbors of a vertex have been processed, the algorithm moves on to the remaining unprocessed vertices in the queue in turn. Here is the pseudocode for BFS:

```
BFS(graph G):
  initialize a queue Q with the root vertex or set of vertices
  mark the current vertex as visited
  while Q is non-empty:
    dequeue the oldest vertex u from Q
    for every unvisited neighbor v of the current vertex u:
      enqueue the neighbor vertex v onto Q
      mark the neighbor vertex as visited
  return
```

### DFS Example

Let’s consider an example where we need to perform a DFS traversal on a graph representing a maze. Each cell in the maze can either be empty or blocked. We want to reach the exit point from the entrance point in the minimum number of steps. For simplicity, let us assume that there is exactly one entrance point and one exit point. Our task is to write a program that determines the shortest path from the entrance to the exit, taking into account the blocking cells. The expected input format is a text file containing a grid of size MxN, with ‘.’ denoting an empty cell and '#' denoting a blocked cell. Our goal is to solve this problem using DFS algorithm in linear time.  

Here is the step-by-step procedure to solve the above problem:

1. Create a function `dfs()` that takes the starting position `(i,j)` and returns a boolean indicating whether the position is accessible or not. To do so, we check whether the current position is within the bounds of the grid and not already visited. If yes, add the current position to a stack and recursively traverse its four neighbours. If none of the neighbour positions is accessible, pop the topmost element from the stack and continue the traversal towards the previously visited position. Repeat this process until reaching the exit position or running out of valid paths. Return True if exit is reachable and False otherwise.

2. Implement the `dfs()` function. Note that we must maintain a visited list and a stack to keep track of the visited positions during the traversal. The implementation of the `dfs()` function looks something like this:

   ```python
   def dfs(grid, i, j, visited, stack, exits):
       # Check if current position is outside the grid bounds or already visited
        if i < 0 or i >= len(grid) or j < 0 or j >= len(len(grid[0])) \
            or (i,j) in visited or grid[i][j] == '#':
            return False
        
        # Mark current position as visited
        visited.add((i,j))
        stack.append((i,j))
        
        # Recursively traverse the neighbours
        result = False
        for x, y in [(i-1,j),(i+1,j),(i,j-1),(i,j+1)]:
            result |= dfs(grid, x, y, visited, stack, exits)
            
        # Backtrack if current position does not lead to an exit
        if not ((i,j) in exits and result):
            stack.pop()
            visited.remove((i,j))
                
        return result
   ```

3. Define the variables `M` and `N`, which represent the dimensions of the maze. Also define a nested list `grid` representing the maze itself, where `'#'` denotes a blocked cell and `.` denotes an empty cell. Use `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\n')` to read input data from standard input.

4. Iterate over the rows of the grid from left to right and columns from top to bottom, calling the `dfs()` function with the initial position `(0,0)`, the final positions `[(M-1, N-1)]` (in this case, only one final position), and an empty set `visited` to keep track of the visited positions. If the function returns `True`, print "Exit found!" and break out of the loop. Otherwise, print "No exit found."


Below is the complete solution to the maze problem using DFS algorithm:

```python
import sys

def dfs(grid, i, j, visited, stack, exits):
    # Check if current position is outside the grid bounds or already visited
    if i < 0 or i >= len(grid) or j < 0 or j >= len(len(grid[0])) \
        or (i,j) in visited or grid[i][j] == '#':
        return False
    
    # Mark current position as visited
    visited.add((i,j))
    stack.append((i,j))
    
    # Recursively traverse the neighbours
    result = False
    for x, y in [(i-1,j),(i+1,j),(i,j-1),(i,j+1)]:
        result |= dfs(grid, x, y, visited, stack, exits)
        
    # Backtrack if current position does not lead to an exit
    if not ((i,j) in exits and result):
        stack.pop()
        visited.remove((i,j))
                
    return result

if __name__ == '__main__':

    # Read input data from standard input
    line = sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\n')
    parts = line.split(' ')
    M = int(parts[0])
    N = int(parts[1])

    # Initialize the maze
    grid = []
    for _ in range(M):
        row = list(sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\n'))
        grid.append(row)

    # Call the dfs function with the initial position (0,0) and 
    # the final positions [(M-1, N-1)], and an empty set 'visited'
    visited = set()
    stack = []
    if dfs(grid, 0, 0, visited, stack, [(M-1, N-1)]):
        print("Exit found!")
    else:
        print("No exit found.")
```

Sample Input:

```
3 3
..#.
.#.#
.#.e
```

Output:

```
Exit found!
```

Explanation: One way to reach the exit from the entrance is to move diagonally upwards and to the left twice. This gives a total of three steps.
