# 1.简介
  

Dynamic programming (DP) is a technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and building up solutions to those subproblems recursively. The solution to the original problem depends on the solutions of its subproblems, but not explicitly stated in advance. 

Greedy algorithms are also known as "divide-and-conquer" or "exploration-exploitation" strategies, where we choose locally optimal choices at each step based on our current knowledge about the problem space. They tend to be efficient when applied iteratively, making it easy to reason about their correctness and completeness. However, they may lead to suboptimal solutions that can be very far from optimal. 

In this article, I will introduce dynamic programming and greedy algorithms through detailed explanations with examples and applications. I hope my writing style enables you to understand these powerful algorithmic techniques better. 

Before diving deep into DP and greedy algorithms, let me first define two terms:

 - Optimal Substructure: An optimization problem has an optimal solution if there exists a subset of the input variables whose value achieves the maximum possible result. In other words, there is no other set of values which results in higher performance than the given set.

 - Overlapping Subproblems: If multiple computations have to be performed for different parts of the same problem instance, then the same subproblem occurs repeatedly, resulting in overlapping subproblems.

Next, I'll discuss some basic concepts such as mathematical formulas, time complexity analysis, etc., before moving onto the core ideas behind both approaches. Let's get started! 

 # 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
  ## 2.1 Mathematical Formulas
  One fundamental concept used in computer science and mathematics is Big O notation, often abbreviated as O(n). It describes the upper bound of the growth rate of an algorithm as the input size increases. For example, the time required to perform n operations grows linearly with n. This means that as the input size increases, the running time of the algorithm also increases linearly proportionally. 

  Another important concept is that of recursion. Recursion is a process where a function calls itself until it reaches a base case. A base case refers to the simplest version of the problem, while the recursive call involves reducing the size of the input problem until it becomes trivial. Recursive functions can make the code more concise and easier to read, especially when dealing with complex data structures like trees and graphs.

  We use the following mathematical formulas to describe the behavior of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms:

  1. The Knapsack Problem: Given a set of items with weights w and values v, determine the maximum total value that can be obtained by choosing a subset of the items without exceeding a certain capacity C. This problem can be solved using dynamic programming by creating an array dp[i][j], where i represents the number of items and j represents the knapsack capacity, initialized to zero. At each iteration i, iterate over all remaining items from index 0 to i-1, calculate the weight wi and value vi of each item, and check whether adding the item would cause the knapsack to exceed its capacity. If it does not, add the item to the knapsack and update dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], vi + dp[i-1][j-wi]), otherwise leave it out. Finally, return dp[N][C].

  2. Traveling Salesman Problem: Given a list of cities and distances between every pair of cities, find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point. This problem can be solved using dynamic programming by creating an array dp[V][V], where V represents the number of vertices in the graph, initialized to infinity except for dp[i][i] = 0 because the distance from any vertex to itself is always zero. Iterate over all pairs of distinct vertices i and j, calculate the distance d between them using dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + w[i][j], where k runs from 0 to i-1 and contains all previously visited vertices. Update dp[i][j] if d < dp[i][j]. Once dp[V][V] is calculated, the answer is dp[0][V]-w[0][V]+dp[V][0], since we need to visit each vertex one time and come back to the origin, hence dp[V][0] gives us the sum of distances between each vertex and the origin plus the length of the route from the last vertex to the destination. 

  3. Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm: Given a connected undirected graph with edge costs c, find a spanning tree T that connects all vertices together with minimum total cost. This problem can be solved using dynamic programming by creating an array dp[V], where V represents the number of vertices in the graph, initialized to infinity except for dp[src]=0. While there are unvisited vertices left, select the unvisited vertex u with lowest dp[u], and mark it as visited. Then, iterate over all neighbors v of u with edges e with cost c, and update dp[v] = min(dp[v], dp[u]+c). Continue selecting vertices and updating dp until all vertices are marked as visited. Finally, build the MST from the selected vertices by connecting all vertices with the smallest dp difference among adjacent edges. 

  4. Huffman Coding: Assign variable lengths to symbols based on their frequency in a message or text. This problem can be solved using a priority queue implemented using binary heaps, where each node stores a symbol along with its frequency count. Initialize a heap of leaf nodes corresponding to unique symbols in the message, and merge the nodes with lowest frequencies until there is only one root node. Encode the message using the assigned codes for each symbol, which corresponds to traversing the path from the root node to the leaf node corresponding to the symbol. 

  5. Maximum Subarray Sum: Find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional integer array of numbers which has the largest sum. This problem can be solved using divide-and-conquer approach by finding the maximum subarray sum ending at position i and maximum subarray sum including position i. Return the maximum of the two sums.

  ## 2.2 Time Complexity Analysis 
  There are several ways to analyze the time complexity of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms. Here are three common methods:

  1. Brute Force Method: Simply enumerate all possibilities and solve each subproblem independently, taking the best solution found so far. Tournament games are commonly used for brute force method, where two players compete to find the winner by playing against each other. The player who finds a winning strategy wins the tournament. However, it takes exponential time to search all possibilities, leading to long computation times for large inputs. 

  2. Master Method: Split the problem into small subproblems, approximate the solution to each subproblem, and combine the answers to obtain the final solution. Typically, master theorem states that the time taken to compute a polynomial-time approximation of a recurrence relation decreases exponentially with the degree of the recursion. Therefore, by applying master theorem to subproblems, we can reduce the overall runtime by a significant amount. 

  3. Polynomial-Time Reductions: Use mathematical identities and properties of arithmetic to simplify expressions and identify equivalent subproblems. Examples include matrix multiplication, Fibonacci sequence, recurrences involving convolution, polygon clipping. These reductions allow us to derive lower bounds on the time complexity, allowing us to compare different algorithms and choose the most appropriate ones. 

The choice of the right approach will depend on the specific nature of the problem and the constraints involved, but I encourage readers to experiment with different approaches and see what works best for their particular situation.
