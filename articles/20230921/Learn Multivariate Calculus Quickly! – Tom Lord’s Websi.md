# 1.简介
  

Multivariate calculus is a subfield of mathematics that deals with functions and vector spaces in multiple dimensions. It plays an important role in applied mathematics, such as data analysis, optimization problems, signal processing, image processing, etc., where there are many variables involved. In this article, we will discuss some basic concepts in multivariate calculus including the definition of vectors, linear equations, matrices, determinants, eigenvalues and eigenvectors. We will then apply these concepts to practical calculations using Python programming language. Finally, we will touch upon other advanced topics such as Fourier series and differential equations. Overall, this article aims to provide a comprehensive guide for learners who want to gain fundamental knowledge about multivariate calculus quickly without spending too much time on detailed theory or mathematical formulas.

Before we begin our discussion, it would be helpful if you have a good understanding of some relevant concepts and terminology:

1) Vector Space: A vector space V over a field F consists of a set of vectors (or scalars), denoted by v = (v1,..., vn) ∈ V, which satisfy two properties: 

(i) Linearity: For any pair of vectors u and v in V, their sum u + v can also be expressed as a single vector w = (w1,..., wp). That is, u + v = (u1 + v1,..., un + vp). 
(ii) Homogeneity: All elements of V belong to a field F, so scalar multiplication s*v for a scalar s and vector v in V can also be expressed as a new vector sv = (sv1,..., svp). That is, s * v = (s * v1,..., s * vp). 

2) Matrix: An m × n matrix M is a rectangular table of numbers, arranged in rows and columns, called its entries, with m rows and n columns. The i-th row of a matrix is identified by the lowercase letters i, while the j-th column is represented by the uppercase letter j. If k refers to the element in the i-th row and the j-th column of a matrix M, we write k = M[i][j]. Mathematically, the entries of a matrix must be real numbers. 

3) Determinant: Let M be an mxn matrix. The determinant of M, denoted det(M), is a scalar value that satisfies three properties:

(a) Properties of determinants: 
(i) det(k*I) = k^m, where I is the identity matrix with dimension m x m, and k is a nonzero constant.
(ii) If u and v are vectors in R^m, then det(uv) = |det(u) * det(v)| and uv^T = vu. 
(iii) If M is invertible, then det(M)!= 0. 

For a square matrix M, the determinant can be computed by expanding along both major diagonals, obtaining a polynomial equation P whose roots give all possible values of the determinant. 

4) Eigenvalue and Eigenvector: Given a square matrix M, let λ be a scalar value and let v be a corresponding eigenvector of M. Then:

λv ≡ ev, where e is the unit vector having 1 at position i and 0 elsewhere. 

5) Fourier Series: A Fourier series is a series of periodic functions of one variable, usually parameterized by an angle, with a fixed amplitude and periodicity, typically written as a sum of cosine terms and sine terms. Its general form is: 

f(x) = c_0/2 + Sum_(n=1)^∞ [c_n * cos(n*π*x)] + Sum_(n=1)^∞ [c_n * sin(n*π*x)]. 

6) Differential Equations: A differential equation is an equation that involves the differentiation of a function with respect to another independent variable, resulting in a function expressible as a partial derivative of order zero. Examples include ODE's like the heat equation, d^2y/dx^2 = p(x) where y represents temperature, and PDE's like the wave equation, du/dt = f(x,t)*du/dx + g(x,t)*du/dy. 


In summary, we need to understand some basic ideas and definitions related to vector spaces, matrices, determinants, eigenvalues and eigenvectors before moving forward into the main topic of this blog post - calculating multivariate integrals and derivatives in Python.
