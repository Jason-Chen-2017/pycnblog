Gauge confinement refers to the situation where a quantum system experiences slow deviations in its phase due to external influences such as gravity or magnetic fields. In this case, the evolution of the system can be described using gauge theory and gauge transformation operators. This paper presents an approach that addresses two important questions related to the effect of momentum transfer on the properties of one-dimensional quantum systems undergoing highly nonlinear dynamics. The first question is how the momentum transfer affect the characterization of quasiperiodic oscillations. We address this by introducing a new class of non-Markovian models called long-range bosons. The second question concerns how the momentum transfer affects finite temperature effects in nonlocal Hamiltonians, including those with macroscopic couplings to the bath degrees of freedom. To answer these questions we develop a general method based on Langevin equations that incorporates the effects of both vibrational and diffusive contributions to the dynamical correlations. Moreover, we present numerical simulations of two examples: a driven harmonic potential and the motion of a coherent state. Our results demonstrate that the methods presented here provide accurate descriptions of the evolution of these systems even when they experience strong fluctuations caused by high-frequency noise. Additionally, our analysis provides insights into the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of nonlocal systems such as entanglement and transport in realistic scenarios. These results have implications for understanding the nature of collective behavior, interactions between different components of the physical system, and the use of advanced technology for addressing various practical problems involving nanoelectronic devices and quantum computing.

In this work, we study the nonlinear dynamics of a one-dimensional quantum system subjected to low frequency and stochastic fluctuations due to its interaction with an environment. Among other applications, this could arise from interference between two weakly interacting particles or their interaction with a strong electromagnetic field. It is well known that distortions in the system's phase are the primary cause of many interesting phenomena in physics such as topological defects in solid surfaces, spatiotemporal chirping in particle accelerators, and wave optics in optical fibers. However, it has been shown recently that the exact mechanism behind the observed effects is still not completely understood. In particular, there exists evidence suggesting that the origin of these effects may involve dissipative processes rather than wave-like motion alone.

One way to better understand the role played by momenta transfer is to consider the problem of describing the evolution of a quantum system undergoing a highly non-linear dynamical regime. Here, we focus on two main aspects: i) how does the momentum transfer affect the shape of quasiperiodic oscillations? ii) what happens to the statistics of finite temperature effects when macroscopic degrees of freedom enter the picture?. For this purpose, we derive rigorous expressions for several key quantities related to the three-point function expansion of the slow-roll equation obtained through perturbation theory. We then apply these tools to analyze the time dependence of slow-roll solutions obtained from a variety of dynamical models such as driven harmonic potentials, open quantum systems and realistic nonequilibrium situations such as a coherent state.

We start by reviewing some basic concepts and techniques used in the literature. Then, we proceed to describe a specific family of models that includes long-range bosons, which offer a natural framework for treating the quantum systems undergoing highly non-linear dynamics. Next, we review existing approaches for analyzing the effect of momentum transfer on quasiperiodic oscillations. Finally, we discuss a brief overview of recent studies that consider finite temperature effects in nonlocal Hamiltonians, specifically considering situations with macroscopic couplings to bath degrees of freedom.
