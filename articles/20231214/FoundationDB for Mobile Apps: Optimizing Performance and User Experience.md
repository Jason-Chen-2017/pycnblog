The FoundationDB client library provides a set of APIs that allow you to interact with the database. This library is available for a variety of programming languages, including C, C++, Java, Python, and Ruby.

### 4.2 FoundationDB Query Example

FoundationDB is a distributed database management system that provides a high-performance, scalable, and reliable solution for mobile apps. It is designed to handle large amounts of data and provide low-latency access to that data. In this article, we will explore the benefits of using FoundationDB for mobile apps and how it can optimize performance and user experience.

Here is an example of a FoundationDB query using FQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE name = 'John';
```

This query selects all rows from the table `my_table` where the `name` column is equal to 'John'.

### 4.3 FoundationDB Replication Example

FoundationDB is a distributed database management system that provides a high-performance, scalable, and reliable solution for mobile apps. It is designed to handle large amounts of data and provide low-latency access to that data. In this article, we will explore the benefits of using FoundationDB for mobile apps and how it can optimize performance and user experience.

```json
{
  "replication": {
    "mode": "sync",
    "sync_peers": [
      {
        "address": "127.0.0.1:3000",
        "priority": 1
      },
      {
        "address": "127.0.0.1:3001",
        "priority": 0
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This configuration specifies that the database should use synchronous replication, and it specifies two replication peers. The first peer has a higher priority than the second peer, which means that it will be used as the primary replication peer.
