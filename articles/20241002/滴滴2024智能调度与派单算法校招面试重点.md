## Mathematical Models and Formulas

### 1. User Demand Prediction Model

**Model Explanation:**
The user demand prediction model is based on a time-series forecasting approach using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models.

**Equation:**
$$
\Delta Y_t = c + a_1 \Delta Y_{t-1} + a_2 \Delta Y_{t-2} + \ldots + a_p \Delta Y_{t-p} + \epsilon_t
$$

**Parameters:**
- \( \Delta Y_t \): Difference between current and previous values.
- \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_p \): Autoregressive coefficients.
- \( c \): Constant term.
- \( \epsilon_t \): Random error term.

**Example:**
Consider a dataset of daily user demand over a month. By training an ARIMA model, we can predict the demand for the next day.

### 2. Path Planning Model

**Model Explanation:**
The path planning model utilizes the A* algorithm to find the optimal route. The algorithm uses a heuristic function to estimate the distance from the current node to the target node.

**Equation:**
$$
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
$$

**Parameters:**
- \( g(n) \): Cost from the start node to the current node.
- \( h(n) \): Estimated cost from the current node to the target node.
- \( f(n) \): Total cost from the start node to the target node through node \( n \).

**Example:**
Suppose we have a map with nodes representing intersections. By applying the A* algorithm, we can find the shortest path from a starting point to a destination.

### 3. Driver Matching Model

**Model Explanation:**
The driver matching model is based on a multi-criteria decision-making approach. It assigns a score to each driver based on various factors and selects the driver with the highest score.

**Equation:**
$$
S_d = w_1 \cdot P_d + w_2 \cdot R_d + w_3 \cdot A_d
$$

**Parameters:**
- \( S_d \): Score assigned to driver \( d \).
- \( P_d \): Proximity score.
- \( R_d \): Rating score.
- \( A_d \): Availability score.
- \( w_1, w_2, w_3 \): Weighting factors.

**Example:**
Assume we have three drivers, and we want to select the best one. By calculating the score for each driver using the above equation, we can choose the driver with the highest score.

### Detailed Explanation and Examples

#### User Demand Prediction Model

**Example:**
Let's say we have the following daily user demand data for a week:

| Day | User Demand |
| --- | --- |
| Mon | 150 |
| Tue | 180 |
| Wed | 160 |
| Thu | 190 |
| Fri | 200 |
| Sat | 220 |
| Sun | 210 |

By training an ARIMA model, we can predict the demand for the next day.

**Step 1:** Calculate the differences:

| Day | User Demand | Difference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mon | 150 | - |
| Tue | 180 | 30 |
| Wed | 160 | -20 |
| Thu | 190 | 30 |
| Fri | 200 | 10 |
| Sat | 220 | 20 |
| Sun | 210 | -10 |

**Step 2:** Calculate the autoregressive coefficients:

\( a_1 = 0.5 \)
\( a_2 = -0.2 \)

**Step 3:** Predict the demand for the next day:

$$
\Delta Y_{8} = 0.5 \cdot \Delta Y_{7} - 0.2 \cdot \Delta Y_{6}
$$

$$
\Delta Y_{8} = 0.5 \cdot (-10) - 0.2 \cdot (-20) = 5
$$

$$
Y_{8} = Y_{7} + \Delta Y_{8} = 210 + 5 = 215
$$

Thus, the predicted user demand for the next day is 215.

## Code Analysis and Performance Evaluation

### 1. Performance Analysis

The implemented code provides a functional framework for the intelligent dispatching and dispatching algorithms used by DiDi in 2024. However, several performance aspects require attention.

**User Demand Prediction:**
The random forest regressor used for demand prediction is a powerful model, but its performance heavily depends on the quality and quantity of the training data. Additionally, the model may overfit the training data if the dataset is small or the feature set is not diverse enough.

**Path Planning:**
The A* algorithm is efficient for path planning, but it assumes that the graph is static. In a real-world scenario, traffic conditions and road closures can change dynamically. To address this, a more robust path planning algorithm that can adapt to real-time changes is necessary.

**Driver Matching:**
The driver matching algorithm prioritizes drivers based on proximity, rating, and availability. However, this approach may not always result in the best match. For example, a highly-rated driver with low availability may be chosen over a nearby driver with a slightly lower rating but higher availability. Introducing more advanced matching strategies, such as a weighted scoring system, can improve the overall matching quality.

**Dispatching:**
The dispatching algorithm integrates the outputs of the demand prediction, path planning, and driver matching modules to optimize the dispatching process. However, the algorithm's performance can be affected by the order in which tasks are processed. Implementing a priority queue to handle high-priority passengers and requests can improve the overall efficiency.

### 2. Potential Optimizations

**Data Quality and Preprocessing:**
Improving the quality and preprocessing of the input data can significantly enhance the performance of the algorithms. Techniques such as data cleaning, feature scaling, and feature engineering can help the models generalize better and reduce overfitting.

**Real-Time Path Planning:**
Integrating real-time traffic data into the path planning algorithm can improve route accuracy and responsiveness. Utilizing advanced algorithms such as genetic algorithms or reinforcement learning can provide more adaptive and efficient path planning capabilities.

**Driver Matching Optimization:**
Enhancing the driver matching algorithm with a weighted scoring system can improve the matching quality. Additionally, incorporating driver preferences and passenger requirements can further optimize the matching process.

**Dispatching Efficiency:**
Implementing a priority queue can ensure that high-priority passengers and requests are processed first, improving overall dispatching efficiency. Combining multiple dispatching strategies, such as batch processing and real-time dispatching, can further optimize the system's performance.

In the next section, we will explore the real-world applications of the intelligent dispatching and dispatching algorithms used by DiDi in 2024 and discuss the benefits and challenges associated with their implementation.
