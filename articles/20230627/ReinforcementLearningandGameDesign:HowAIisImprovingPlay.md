Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a fundamental technique in machine learning and has been applied in various fields, including gaming. By learning from its environment, an agent (player) can make decisions to maximize its cumulative reward. This process of learning through experience is known asRL, and it has changed the way we design games.

In this article, we will discuss the application of RL in game design and how AI is improving player behavior. We will cover the technical principles, implementation steps, and future trends in this field.
