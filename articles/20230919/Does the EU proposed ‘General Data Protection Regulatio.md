# 1.简介
  

The European Union (EU) is currently negotiating a new privacy regulatory framework called “GDPR” (General Data Protection Regulation). This will come into force on May 25th, 2018. In this blog post we explore what GDPR might imply for individuals' rights in terms of privacy protection and how it could be implemented to protect sensitive personal information from abuse or misuse by businesses and organizations. We also discuss possible future concerns and opportunities that arise as more countries adopt GDPR. Overall, our goal is to provide an overview of what GDPR is, its main features and benefits, as well as some considerations and practical steps to implement GDPR for individuals within each country.

# 2.GDPR概述
GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a new European Union policy designed to strengthen individual rights under data protection laws across Europe. The core principles of GDPR are:

1. Right to access – Everyone should have the right to request their personal data which they have provided to third parties for purposes such as research or marketing, and copies of these data should be provided upon request.
2. Right to rectification – Any person who has inaccurate or incomplete personal data should have the right to have them corrected.
3. Right to erasure/restriction/portability – Individuals should have the right to erase their personal data, restrict processing of their personal data, or receive a copy of their data that can be moved to another controller without discrimination based on protected characteristics like race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or other criteria.
4. Right to object – Any person who feels that their personal data has been processed unfairly may submit a complaint to a supervisory authority.
5. Transparency and accountability – The use of personal data must be made public and accountable for all actions taken with respect to said data. Processes for handling requests, collection, storage, and usage of personal data must be transparent to everyone involved.
6. Lawfulness basis for processing – Personal data collected should only be processed for legitimate reasons and when there is a clear legal basis for doing so.
7. Security measures – Policies and practices to ensure security, including robust technical and administrative measures, are required to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of personal data during processing.

In addition to these basic principles, GDPR provides specific requirements for organizations that collect and process personal data, such as establishing a "data protection officer" and setting up standard contracts between controllers and processors to ensure consistent treatment of personal data and compliance with data protection law. Additional provisions govern certain categories of data, such as healthcare data subject to stricter standards than those applied to other types of personal data. Finally, several optional exemptions permit certain activities related to personal data, such as scientific research and education, that do not constitute a breach of data protection.

Overall, GDPR seeks to ensure that every individual has the right to full transparency about the ways in which their personal data is used and accessed, and that these uses comply with relevant data protection laws and international treaties. By adopting GDPR, companies and organizations need to make significant changes to their internal processes and policies to prepare for the way personal data will be handled moving forward. However, taking action to enforce GDPR effectively requires careful planning and communication with stakeholders at various levels of government and industry.

# 3.权利与义务

Under GDPR, individuals are afforded four key freedoms to protect their personal data:

1. Right to Access - People have the right to obtain confirmation of whether or not they have consented to the processing of their personal data and to obtain access to the personal data that has already been collected. Companies, associations, and civil society organisations must provide individuals with access to their personal data, even if it is being shared anonymously or sold to third parties for commercial purposes. Organizations should set clear guidelines for how consumers can exercise these rights and share their requested information securely using appropriate technology and procedures.

2. Right to Rectification – People have the right to request correction of their personal data where it is inaccurate or incomplete. They must be given enough time to correct the data before it is processed further, unless it is impossible to verify or complete the data due to legal, contractual or organizational obstacles.

3. Right to Erasure/Restriction/Portability – People have the right to demand that their personal data be erased, restricted, or ported away after a specified period of time. This includes direct requests by the affected individual; automated mechanisms such as algorithms or AI-powered tools that decide to block or delete personal data based on predictive analysis or profiling; and whenever the data cannot be deleted directly but needs to be removed from backups or deactivated temporarily while evidence is gathered or reviewed. Portability allows individuals to move their data to another controller, typically outside the EU, as long as necessary safeguards are put in place to preserve their privacy and ensure proper transfer of personal data according to GDPR rules and conditions. Restriction refers to a temporary suspension of processing activity under a specific legal reason until the cause of the restriction no longer exists or is resolved. Restriction does not mean that the affected individual’s personal data won’t be accessible again later, just that additional restrictions on its use are being applied because of the conflict of interest. 

4. Right to Object – People have the right to object to the processing of their personal data where it is contrary to their interests. A detailed explanation of the purpose of the processing is needed in order to give the affected individual the opportunity to challenge it. If the objected party challenges successfully, the data controller must provide sufficient proof to justify the decision. Objections may also result in data being collected, stored, or processed less frequently or not at all, depending on the nature of the objection and the harm caused by noncompliance. 

Given these four freedoms, individuals have the ability to maintain control over their personal data and communicate their preferences accordingly. It's important to remember that exercising these rights requires fair and effective communication with the relevant authorities and representatives at all levels of government and industry, especially where personal data is shared beyond the control of the data subject.  

# 4.实践建议
To implement GDPR, countries need to follow a number of steps:

1. Publish and adhere to data protection laws and regulations. Before implementing GDPR, countries must publish and officially adopt comprehensive data protection laws and regulations covering business transactions, consumer behavior, and online services. These laws should include explicit guidelines on the scope and type of personal data collected, the purpose(s) for which it is used, and how it is shared with third parties. Controllers and processors must work together to align their respective data protection obligations and responsibilities with those of the national legislation and national policies. This step ensures that companies and organizations understand what data they own and how it will be used, and that they have a roadmap to comply with new data protection laws and regulations.

2. Collect and manage personal data. Most countries today require data subjects to provide their personal data voluntarily through a variety of forms such as surveys, questionnaires, and agreements. Businesses must create clear and easy-to-understand data sharing agreements and processes that detail exactly what information is collected, why it is collected, and how it will be used. Customers must be given choices regarding the collection, management, and sharing of their personal data. Organizations must establish strong ethical frameworks and conduct thorough due diligence to validate the trustworthiness and reliability of third-party service providers. Additionally, businesses must track individual visitors and customers, providing notice of the data collection and usage policies alongside cookies and tracking technologies.

3. Implement technological solutions. Countries must invest in building robust technical and administrative infrastructure to support data protection best practices. New technologies, such as encryption, access controls, and payment systems, must be deployed throughout the organization to help keep personal data secure. Prevention programs must be established to identify and prevent data breaches and cybersecurity threats that could potentially jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal data. Continuously monitoring the effectiveness of data protection measures and regularly reviewing audit reports are essential components of good data protection hygiene. 

4. Strengthen internal policies and procedures. Countries must continue to develop internal policies and procedures for collecting, managing, storing, and sharing personal data. These policies should aim to promote positive outcomes for both individuals and organizations, fostering collaboration and cooperation, and encouraging ethical behaviour and compliance. Policy development should take into consideration the interplay between data ownership, risk assessment, and data protection obligations. For example, a company may have more incentives to limit or terminate data sharing when it becomes apparent that the benefit outweighs the risk, or where the risks increase with increased transparency. Internal communications and engagement efforts should focus on informing citizens and businesses of data protection best practices and reporting mechanisms. 

5. Encourage external involvement. Moreover, countries must encourage foreign investment, such as technology startups and global corporations, to join the effort. Foreign institutions should partner with local entities to collaborate on data protection issues, educate citizens, and build awareness amongst employees and communities. Public officials must support initiatives such as the Right to Information Act (RTIA), which enables individuals to seek clarification or receive additional information about their personal data that has been collected by an organization. Finally, participatory democracies must drive conversation and deliberation around data protection topics by bringing together experts and policymakers from different sectors and cultures to enhance collective understanding and accountability. 

Despite the complexities of GDPR implementation, there are many concrete steps that can be taken to improve the overall quality of life and privacy for individuals. Within each country, economic, political, and social factors still shape the feasibility of achieving true data protection reform, but improvements in knowledge and understanding of GDPR and how it applies to individuals can help pave the path towards reconciliation.
