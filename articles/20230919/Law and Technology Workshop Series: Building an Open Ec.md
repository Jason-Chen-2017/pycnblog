# Our World in Data (OWD) is a massive repository of data about the world that enables researchers to analyze it and make sense of it. As a result, OWD has become one of the most essential resources available on topics related to economics, politics, social sciences, health, education, culture, media, and more.

At the same time, law and technology have also come together to form unique partnerships across many fields such as AI, cybersecurity, blockchain, big data, and so on. These advancements have led to new opportunities and challenges for both sides. However, this complex relationship between law and technology brings with it some risks. One important challenge concerns the ethical, legal, and societal implications of these relationships. Moreover, there is no established framework or structure for promoting knowledge exchange between law and technologists. This hindered progress towards creating a balanced and effective ecosystem for researchers working in the field of law and technology.

In response to this challenge, we propose building an open ecosystem for law and technology researchers by organizing annual workshops focused on advancing research collaborations across disciplines, establishing shared resources for learning and sharing expertise, and supporting career development programs and mentorship programs. We call this initiative the Law and Technology Workshop series. In this article, we will introduce our plan and outline its key components, which include how we can leverage the existing OWD platform to support the workshop series and help connect law and technology experts from various backgrounds and institutions. By doing so, we aim to create a common space where researchers can share ideas, learn from each other, and build upon their collective experiences to advance the state of the art in law and technology.  

This blog post is written for law professors, graduate students, junior faculty members, and experienced practitioners interested in leveraging the power of digital technologies to enhance the role of law and technology in our society. We hope that you find this proposal interesting and useful! We look forward to hearing your thoughts and comments below.


# 2.	Basic Concepts & Terminology

Before diving into the technical details of our proposed initiative, let's first briefly go over some basic concepts and terminology used in law and technology research. 

- **Economic Development:** Economic development refers to policies, programs, and measures designed to promote economic growth through employment creation, job creation, higher wages, tax cuts, reform of credit systems, infrastructure investment, and more.

- **Technology Transfer:** Technology transfer refers to the use of new technologies to improve processes or products, automate jobs, increase efficiency, reduce costs, or make better decisions. The goal is to transform industries by adopting new technologies and using them to streamline business processes or create new markets.

- **Digital Divide:** The digital divide refers to a widespread gap between those who are afforded access to internet-based services and those who do not have the necessary skills, tools, or understanding. This gap is often due to socioeconomic factors like income, educational level, geographical location, race, gender, and class. 

- **Gender Equality:** Gender equality refers to efforts made by governments, organizations, businesses, and individuals to ensure equal opportunities for women and men in all aspects of life, including employment, housing, healthcare, education, and more.

- **Privacy Policy:** A privacy policy outlines what information a company collects and why they need it. It includes terms such as “collection”, “use”, “disclosure”, “storage”, “deletion”, and “sharing”. It describes how a person’s personal information may be collected, used, accessed, and protected by the organization collecting it.

- **Data Breach:** A data breach occurs when a sensitive personal or financial information belonging to an individual is unintentionally released without proper authorization. It can result in significant harm to an individual’s personal or financial security, identity, and property.

- **Lawyer/Engineer Collaboration:** Lawyers and engineers work closely together to develop strategies, procedures, protocols, templates, and guidelines that are crucial in ensuring compliance with legal requirements. They must work together to identify areas of conflict, seek solutions, and apply best practices to resolve issues. 

- **Regulatory Authority:** A regulatory authority is a government agency responsible for enforcing laws and policies within a particular area or industry. An example could be the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is responsible for securities laws in the US.

- **Public Relations:** Public relations involves influencing public opinion and informing people about companies, events, and policies. It typically focuses on increasing awareness of the company’s mission, engagement with customers, addressing issues and providing feedback to employees.

- **Intellectual Property Rights:** Intellectual property rights refer to all ownership interests in creative works such as literature, film, music, design, software, and trademarks. These rights protect the value of ideas and prevent others from violating the copyrights. 

We should note here that the list above is far from exhaustive and only provides a general overview of some of the key concepts and terminology used in law and technology research. There are several other concepts and terminology worth mentioning, but they would distract from the core idea of the law and technology workshops. 


# 3.Core Algorithm and Operations Steps 
The objective of the Law and Technology Workshop series is to provide a common space for exploring ways in which law and technology researchers can collaborate, communicate, and share their findings. Here are the high-level steps involved in setting up the initial meeting:

1. Identify a relevant topic or problem: During the early stages, participants will select a specific topic or problem related to law and technology research, such as privacy, data breaches, liability, and intellectual property. 

2. Define objectives: After selecting a topic, participants will define clear objectives for the workshop, identifying the specific questions they want answered, insights they wish to gain, and goals they want to achieve.

3. Select experts and stakeholders: Participants will then select experts and stakeholders from different disciplines to contribute to the discussion. Experts will present case studies, research papers, or surveys that address a specific aspect of the problem being studied. Stakeholders will be invited to attend meetings to discuss the project and give input on future directions.

4. Plan a timeline: Based on the needs identified during the initial discussions, participants will set a date and time for the next meeting, and refine the schedule based on availability.

5. Conduct the meeting: Once the initial meeting is complete, participants will split into smaller groups to focus on developing a shared vision for the project. Each group will choose a specific research question and present a presentation highlighting the latest advances and lessons learned.

Here are some examples of possible activities that could be undertaken in each meeting:

1. Case study analysis: One possible activity could involve analyzing a real-world case study to understand the context and motivations behind the decision to implement the solution described in the paper. This might involve looking at the scope and limitations of the original solution, reviewing evidence of success, and identifying any potential pitfalls.

2. Presentation Q&A session: Another activity could involve hosting a roundtable discussion where experts answer questions posed by participants and stakeholders. This could serve as an opportunity for participants to exchange opinions and learn from each other, while still allowing stakeholders to remain confident that their views are being heard and taken into account.

3. Networking event: Participants might also decide to host networking events at regular intervals throughout the year, bringing together experts from various disciplines to further explore the problems being studied and learn from each other. For instance, participating lawyers and engineers might gather to discuss current trends, competing priorities, and seeking collaboration opportunities.

Once participants reach a consensus on the approach and direction for the project, they will move onto planning and executing the full program. At this point, they will start by compiling a detailed agenda for the next few months, making sure to include logistics such as venues, catering, and accommodation.

Finally, they will start coordinating a team of dedicated volunteers to manage the program, covering tasks such as selecting speakers, arranging rooms, holding regular check-ins, and monitoring the quality of communication. Additionally, they will consult with colleagues across law school departments to identify additional opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration, scholarships, and professional development.

Overall, the Law and Technology Workshop series aims to foster cross-sector collaboration by providing a venue for lawyers, engineers, scientists, and technologists to exchange ideas and learn from each other. By encouraging institutions around the country to partner with leading tech companies and public interest organizations, we can build capacity and influence in the legal sector to push forward meaningful change in the way we conduct business and interact with the public.
