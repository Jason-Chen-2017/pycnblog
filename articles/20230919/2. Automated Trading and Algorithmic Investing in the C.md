## 1.1 大规模区块链技术的兴起
随着金融科技行业的蓬勃发展，以及社会对数字货币、加密货币的极大追捧，各国政府和商界开始逐步将自己所知甚至所做的一些业务的关键元素迁移到区块链上来。作为这一进程的重要里程碑事件之一，2017年底，比特币价格突破1000美元/枚。截止到2019年初，全球已有超过十亿人拥有比特币，而且由于其独有的分布式账本和去中心化的特性，使得其成为一项具有巨大价值的新型支付工具和储存媒介。
然而，随着区块链技术的日益普及，各大互联网公司也纷纷将自己的服务或产品迁移到区块链上来，如GitHub、Amazon Web Services (AWS)、Google Cloud Platform (GCP)。基于这一趋势，越来越多的人开始关注到区块链的机遇与挑战。尤其是近年来，中国互联网巨头腾讯通过建立公共区块链——腾讯链，已经引起了社会的广泛关注。
## 1.2 回顾人工智能（AI）时代
在过去的两千多年里，人类已经探索并开发出了大量的工具、方法、手段用于解决各种各样的问题。其中包括数学、科学、工程、艺术、历史、语言等领域。到了二十一世纪初，随着信息技术的飞速发展和计算能力的提高，人们开始着力于利用计算机来实现这些工具的自动化。
深刻的改变便出现在2012年阿尔法狗，它是一个利用强化学习和人工生命系统（ALife）进行自动交易的智能机器人。从此之后，人工智能（AI）进入了一个全新的时代，带来了诸如AlphaGo、苹果的Siri、微软的Cortana、谷歌助手、亚马逊Alexa、Facebook Messenger等一系列的应用。到目前为止，人工智能已经影响着几乎所有事物，帮助我们完成从制造产品到解决问题的一切工作。
## 2.金融科技的革命性转变
随着区块链技术的兴起，人工智能技术也渐渐地被重视起来。区块链不仅提供了一种公开透明的记录方式，而且它的分布式网络结构使得多个节点可以同时验证每一个交易，保证了整个系统的可信度。此外，区块链还能够提供足够的安全保障，让用户的资产更加安全。基于以上原因，很多投资者开始利用人工智能技术来进行自动化交易。
人工智能（AI）在金融市场的应用主要分为以下两个方向：
- 趋势跟踪（Trend Tracking）:根据市场变化及其预测，选择买入卖出的时机。
- 套利（Arbitrage）：通过分析两个市场间的价格差异，达到交易获利的目的。
此外，还有许多领域都在使用人工智能技术，例如自动驾驶汽车、疫情防控、健康管理、食品监控、法律分析等。

# 2. AUTOMATED TRADING AND ALGORITHMIC INVESTING IN THE CONTEXT OF BIG TECH'S SHIFT TO BLOCKCHAIN
## 3. INTRODUCTION  
The shift towards using blockchain technology as a platform for financial transactions has been a significant change in recent years with major players like Alibaba Group China's QLBlockchain shifting their entire trading infrastructure onto Bitcoin blockchain. In addition to this, various startups have started building blockchains for different applications such as cryptocurrency exchange, healthcare, insurance, food tracking etc. This has triggered an interest among traders who are eager to use these technologies in their day-to-day operations. However, most of them still remain reluctant to adopt the new technology as it is quite complex and requires advanced technical skills that they may not possess at this point in time. Therefore, we will talk about automated trading and algorithmic investing which can be used by those who want to implement these techniques successfully on their portfolio.

In traditional finance, algorithms play an important role in generating buy and sell signals based on historical data. On the other hand, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically deep learning, opens up entirely new possibilities for making money without relying solely on human decision-making. The rise of AI algorithms has driven the stock market indices, leading to the development of high-frequency trading strategies and predictive models. As the buzzwords like "algorithmic trading" or "financial machine learning" become more commonplace, people are starting to look into how these techniques can work for themselves and ultimately automate their portfolios. 

Regarding the importance of this technology, there are several reasons why it has gained immense popularity over the last decade. Firstly, it provides transparency in the marketplaces because every transaction is publicly recorded on the chain. Secondly, it offers security because nodes on the network validate each transaction before it takes place. Thirdly, the distributed nature of the system allows multiple parties to participate simultaneously providing better liquidity than any single entity could provide alone. Additionally, all these factors combine together to make Bitcoin one of the most secure and reliable digital currencies available today. With so many advantages, this seems like a logical choice for anyone looking to trade securities digitally.

Therefore, in conclusion, while blockchain technology has come a long way from its infancy, the investment process utilizing AI and automation remains very much viable. It is essential for traders to understand the fundamentals of blockchain technology and leverage its strengths in order to thrive in the era of big tech.
