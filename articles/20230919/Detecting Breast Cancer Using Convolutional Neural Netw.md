# 1.简介
  

Breast cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the lining of the male breast. It mainly affects women and usually manifests as a dark sclerotic pattern. The early detection of breast cancer can prevent its harmful effects and reduce the risk of further complications such as cystitis, ulcers or blood clots. Therefore, accurate diagnosis of breast cancer at an early stage could lead to improved survival rate and improve life quality of patients.
In this article, we will use deep learning algorithms with convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify whether a human has breast cancer or not based on various features such as skin pixels, nipple size, and cell shape. We will also explore how CNN works under the hood by visualizing the filters learned by the model during training. Finally, we will evaluate our models using different evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, AUC score and confusion matrix.
Before diving into the detailed explanation of each step, let's briefly review some concepts and terminology used in image recognition:

1. Pixel: Each pixel represents one individual pixel within an image, which consists of three color values for red, green, and blue channels representing the amount of light emitted by the light source. 

2. Image resolution: The number of pixels along both width and height dimensions defines the resolution of an image. 

3. Feature map: The output of a layer in a CNN is called feature map. It captures high-level representations of the input image at different spatial scales. For example, when a CNN is trained to identify objects from images, it may start with low-level features like edges or colors and gradually learn higher-level abstractions like shapes and textures. 

4. Filter: Filters are small matrices of weights that are convolved over the input data to extract specific features. During training, these filters are adjusted automatically to minimize the loss function that measures their ability to recognize patterns in the input data. 

5. Pooling layer: Another important operation performed by CNN layers is pooling. This operation reduces the dimensionality of the feature maps produced by previous layers, resulting in smaller but more abstracted outputs. 

6. Fully connected layer: After several convolutional and pooling layers, the final output of the CNN is passed through fully connected layers where the raw features are combined into a single prediction value. 

Now that you have a basic understanding of image recognition terms, let’s move forward to the main topic of this article – detecting breast cancer using CNNs in Python with Keras. 

# 2. Concepts & Terminologies

We will be building a binary classifier to predict if a person has breast cancer or not based on multiple features such as skin pixels, nipple size, and cell shape. Here are some additional terms and definitions that might come up while reading this article:

1. Breast Cancer Malignant vs Benign: Malignant means cancerous cells that spread to nearby tissue while benign refers to non-cancerous cells. 

2. Biopsy: Consists of surgical removal of a portion of the breast tissue to study the cancerous cells present inside it.

3. Risk Factor Analysis: An analysis carried out to determine the chances of developing breast cancer in individuals based on factors such as age, sex, family history, BMI, obesity level, alcohol consumption, etc.


# 3. Algorithm Description
The algorithm we will be using is called a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It is a type of artificial neural network inspired by the structure and function of the human visual cortex. It uses a series of convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers to process inputs. The first few layers extract local features such as edges and colors that later layers combine them into more complex features. These layers help the CNN capture complex relationships between adjacent pixels that cannot easily be expressed using traditional linear methods. 

Here are the steps involved in building our CNN for breast cancer detection:

1. Load the dataset: Our dataset contains pixel information about skin of people who either have or do not have breast cancer.

2. Preprocess the dataset: We need to normalize the pixel intensities so that they fall between 0 and 1, resize all images to the same size, and split the dataset into train and test sets.

3. Build the CNN architecture: We create a sequential model consisting of several convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. Each layer takes in an input tensor and applies transformations to it before passing it on to the next layer. We add dropout layers after every dense layer to avoid overfitting and increase generalization performance.

4. Train the model: We compile the model and specify the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metric. Then we fit the model on the training set and evaluate it on the validation set. If the validation loss continues to decrease, we save the model checkpoint and stop training.

5. Test the model: Once we have selected the best performing model, we load the saved checkpoint and apply it to the test set. We calculate various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, AUC score and confusion matrix to measure the performance of our model. 


## Step 1 - Load Dataset 
Our dataset consists of PNG files containing the pixel intensity values of the skin area taken from biopsied breast cancer patients. Since there are no labels associated with each file, we'll create a new column 'label' indicating if a patient has breast cancer or not based on certain criteria. Let's say we consider someone diagnosed with breast cancer if their nipple size is greater than or equal to 3mm or if they have any white adenomas detected using histopathological stainings. Below is the code to read the data and create the 'label' column accordingly:

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
from PIL import Image

# Read CSV file containing metadata for each image
df = pd.read_csv('data/breast_cancer_metadata.csv')

# Define threshold for nipple size for label assignment
nipple_threshold = 3 # mm

# Iterate over each file in directory and assign labels based on criteria above
for filename in df['filename']:
    filepath = f'data/{filename}'
    img = np.array(Image.open(filepath))
    
    niples = [img[x][y] for x in range(len(img)) for y in range(len(img[0])) if img[x][y] == [255, 255, 255]]
    num_niples = len(niples) / (len(img)*len(img[0])) * 1000 # Convert to millimeters
    
    if num_niples >= nipple_threshold:
        df.loc[df['filename'] == filename, 'label'] = 1
        
# Remove unnecessary columns
del df['path']
del df['Unnamed: 0']
```

## Step 2 - Preprocessing 
Next, we preprocess the dataset by normalizing the pixel intensities between 0 and 1, resizing all images to a common size (we chose 75x75), and splitting the data into train and test sets. To normalize the pixel intensities, we divide each pixel intensity by 255 since the maximum value for each channel (red, green, and blue) is 255. Resizing all images ensures that all images have the same number of pixels regardless of their original size, making it easier for us to compare them against each other. Splitting the dataset into train and test sets helps us evaluate the performance of our model without allowing our model to peek at the test data during training.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Resize all images to 75x75
newsize = (75,75)
X = np.zeros((df.shape[0],)+newsize+(3,))

for i,row in enumerate(df.iterrows()):
    imfile = row[1]['filename']
    X[i] = np.asarray(Image.open(f'data/{imfile}').resize(newsize))/255
    
# Create target variable 'label'
Y = df['label'].values

# Split data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

## Step 3 - Building the Architecture 
We build our CNN architecture using the Sequential API provided by Keras. We begin with two Conv2D layers with ReLU activation functions and max pooling layers with pool sizes of 2x2. The first convolutional layer has 32 filters and a kernel size of 3x3; the second convolutional layer has 64 filters and a kernel size of 3x3. We then flatten the output of the last convolutional layer and pass it through two Dense layers with 128 neurons and ReLU activations. We also add a Dropout layer with a rate of 0.5 after the first Dense layer to reduce overfitting. Next, we add another Dense layer with one output node corresponding to our binary classification task and sigmoid activation function to produce probabilities for the positive class. Lastly, we compile the model using categorical crossentropy loss and Adam optimizer.

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout

# Initialize model
model = Sequential()

# Add first convolutional layer with 32 filters and 3x3 kernel size
model.add(Conv2D(filters=32,kernel_size=(3,3),activation='relu',input_shape=(75,75,3)))
model.add(MaxPooling2D())

# Add second convolutional layer with 64 filters and 3x3 kernel size
model.add(Conv2D(filters=64,kernel_size=(3,3),activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D())

# Flatten output of last convolutional layer and connect to hidden layers
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(units=128,activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(rate=0.5))
model.add(Dense(units=1,activation='sigmoid'))

# Compile model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',loss='binary_crossentropy',metrics=['accuracy'])
```

## Step 4 - Training the Model 
Finally, we train the model on our preprocessed data using batch size of 32 and epochs of 10. We also track the validation loss and save checkpoints whenever the validation loss stops improving. If the validation loss starts increasing again, we stop training and choose the best performing model based on the validation loss and evaluation metric chosen earlier.

```python
from keras.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint

# Set callback for saving checkpoints
checkpoint = ModelCheckpoint('weights.best.hdf5', monitor='val_loss', verbose=1, save_best_only=True, mode='min')

# Fit model on training set
history = model.fit(X_train, Y_train, validation_data=(X_test, Y_test), batch_size=32, epochs=10, callbacks=[checkpoint])

# Load best model
model.load_weights('weights.best.hdf5')
```

## Step 5 - Testing the Model 
After selecting the best performing model, we evaluate it on our test set using various evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, AUC score and confusion matrix. We use these metrics to understand how well our model performs on unseen data.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, auc, accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, confusion_matrix

# Generate predictions on test set
preds = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate evaluation metrics
fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(Y_test, preds)
auc_score = auc(fpr, tpr)
acc = accuracy_score(np.round(preds), Y_test)
prec = precision_score(np.round(preds), Y_test)
rec = recall_score(np.round(preds), Y_test)
f1 = f1_score(np.round(preds), Y_test)
cm = confusion_matrix(np.round(preds), Y_test)

print(f'Accuracy: {acc:.4f}\nPrecision: {prec:.4f}\nRecall: {rec:.4f}\nF1 Score: {f1:.4f}\nAuc Score: {auc_score:.4f}')
print('\nConfusion Matrix:\n', cm)
```
