## 人机交互系统（HCI）
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is an interdisciplinary field of study that focuses on designing and developing interactive systems to enable people to interact with machines and other devices in a natural and humanistic way. It involves researchers working across fields including cognitive science, computer science, engineering, psychology, economics, and others to create products and services that are intuitive, accessible, and useful. While HCI has been gaining importance recently due to the advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), it also offers a unique perspective on how humans can connect to machines and technologies more naturally by creating effective interfaces between them. The goal of this article is to explore the potential biases that exist within current machine learning algorithms, as well as discuss how these implications for social change can be explored.
## 概览
Machine learning models have become increasingly popular over the last few years, enabling technology companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft to provide personalized recommendations, autonomous driving cars, search engines, and so much more. However, as artificial intelligence becomes increasingly sophisticated, they often produce unfair or discriminatory results. This phenomenon is known as algorithmic bias, which occurs when an AI system's decision process does not accurately reflect its input data, leading to biased outcomes or negative consequences for certain demographics or groups.

For instance, consider a case where we use machine learning algorithms to predict whether a person will default on a mortgage loan based on their income and history. A model might learn from past examples of defaulters who were likely to repay the money but mistakenly flagged nondefaulters as being at higher risk because of low incomes. As a result, these predictions may lead to increased financial losses for individuals with lower incomes, even though those same individuals would be better off if they had waited until the high risk group repaid the loans before taking action.

In order to address algorithmic bias and promote fairness in machine learning applications, various techniques have been developed, such as collecting diverse datasets, training on multiple metrics, using regularization methods, and ensuring that the training data represents a wide range of contexts. However, there is no single recipe for solving all possible cases of algorithmic bias and achieving robust performance while still protecting user privacy and security. Research continues to identify new avenues for exploring algorithmic bias and promoting social equity.

## 目标
The primary objective of this paper is to explore and evaluate the potential biases that exist within currently available machine learning algorithms, both historical and modern. Specifically, this work seeks to answer two key questions:
1. What types of biases exist within current machine learning algorithms? How could they impact different demographic groups and under what conditions?
2. To what extent do these biases impact existing technology platforms and businesses, and what factors could contribute towards mitigating these effects? Can they be addressed through policy changes or improved processes, or should we abandon altogether our technological endeavors to focus on creating technology that serves everyone equitably?

We hope that by analyzing the root causes of algorithmic bias, we can inspire further exploration into improving machine learning systems that serve human needs without compromising individual privacy and safety. We also aim to raise awareness among practitioners, policymakers, and consumers about the limitations of current machine learning approaches, and suggest ways forward to develop more inclusive and just AI systems that empower all. Finally, we want to demonstrate the utility of this research by highlighting real-world challenges and opportunities for progress in addressing these issues in future research. Our contributions include a thorough review of existing literature, technical evaluation of relevant algorithms, and experimental analysis of alternative methodologies for mitigation and improvement of bias in machine learning systems.
