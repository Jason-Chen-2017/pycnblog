Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning that provides an agent with the ability to learn from its interaction with an environment by trial and error. The goal of RL is to maximize cumulative rewards achieved over time. It learns by taking actions in the environment based on observations and rewarding or punishing them accordingly. Reinforcement learning algorithms can be classified into two main categories: model-based and model-free methods. Model-based methods use a theoretical framework for planning and decision making while model-free methods use empirical methods such as Q-learning, SARSA, etc., which do not assume any particular structure or dynamics of the world. 

In this article, we will introduce basic concepts, terminology and mathematical definitions related to Reinforcement Learning. We will then discuss the core algorithmic principles behind various RL techniques and explain their working mechanism through specific examples. Finally, we will cover some practical aspects of applying RL in industry applications along with possible future directions and challenges. This article assumes readers are familiar with basic machine learning concepts such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, optimization and probability theory.


# 2. Basic Concepts

## Markov Decision Process (MDP)
An MDP is a tuple $(S, A, R, T, \gamma)$ where 
- $S$ represents a set of states,
- $A(s)$ represents the action space at state s, i.e., all possible actions that an agent can take at state $s$,
- $R(s,a,s')$ is the expected immediate reward obtained when executing action $a$ in state $s$ and transitioning to state $s'$,
- $T(s,a,s')$ specifies the probability of transitioning from state $s$ to state $s'$ due to action $a$. In other words, it tells us how likely the agent is to get to state $s'$ if they choose action $a$ in state $s$, and $\sum_{s'} T(s,a,s') = 1$ for all $s\in S$.
- $\gamma$ is a discount factor that determines the importance of future rewards versus current ones. If $\gamma=1$, the agent only cares about immediate rewards; if $\gamma<1$, it also values long-term rewards highly.

The problem of finding the optimal policy for an MDP can be formulated as follows: given initial state $s_0$, find the best sequence of actions $a^*(t), t=1,...,T$ that maximizes the expected sum of discounted rewards up to time step $T$:

$$Q^{\pi}(s_0, a^*):=\sum_{s'\in S} \gamma^{t-1}\left[R(s_t,a_t,s_t+1)+\mathbb{E}_{s'\sim P(.|s_t)}[V^{\pi}(s')] \right]$$

where $\pi$ is the optimal policy and $V^{\pi}(s)=\max_{\pi}{Q^{\pi}(s,a)}$ is the value function for state $s$. Thus, the optimal policy $\pi*$ is defined as:

$$\pi^*(s):=\arg\max_a {Q^{\pi}(s,a)}$$

## Value Function Approximation
One way to solve MDPs is to use dynamic programming, which involves solving Bellman equations iteratively using the available information (i.e., current state, action, next state). However, there might be many states and/or actions, which makes exact solutions computationally expensive and impractical. Therefore, researchers have proposed several approximate methods for approximating the value function based on samples. These include linear function approximation, nonlinear regression models, kernel-based methods, and neural networks. For example, in nonparametric regression approaches like linear regression, one takes a fixed number of basis functions and fit them to the observed data points. Then, at each point in time, the predicted value is calculated by evaluating these basis functions at the corresponding input. Kernel-based methods involve constructing a functional basis that maps inputs directly to values, without the need for explicit construction of basis functions. Neural networks can be trained end-to-end to map states to values directly without the need for manual feature engineering or parameter selection. 


## Policy Gradient Methods
Policy gradient methods leverage the idea that the optimal action distribution for a given state should be differentiable with respect to the parameters of the policy. Specifically, they update the parameters of the policy so that the ratio of actual returns to expected returns obtained by following the current policy becomes larger under a certain direction. Intuitively, this means that the policy gradients tell us what direction to move the parameters in order to improve performance on average. 

There are several variations of policy gradient methods depending on whether they use stochastic policies or deterministic policies, use value function estimates or sample-based estimates, and employ exploration strategies or pretraining procedures. Popular options include REINFORCE, actor-critic, PPO, TRPO, ACKTR, DDPG, and TD3. 

In summary, RL is a powerful tool for understanding complex sequential decision-making problems by exploiting temporal and contextual relationships between events and agents within environments.
