# 1.简介
  

Artificial Intelligence (AI) projects are essential for industry organizations to revolutionize their business processes and enable them to deliver new products or services faster than ever before. With AI’s ability to automate decision-making tasks, organizations can now use data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing techniques to improve their overall efficiency and effectiveness. Despite this advantage, there is a lack of understanding about how decisions are made and what influences these decisions on different AI projects. This paper attempts to fill this gap by examining the people involved in AI projects as well as the landscape and context surrounding these projects that influence these decisions. We will analyze examples from three popular industries - finance, healthcare, and e-commerce - to understand how AI decisions impact these industories. To do so, we will first discuss the basic concepts and terminology related to AI development. Then, we will explore the various stages involved in an AI project and the stakeholders involved with each stage. Finally, we will look at the factors affecting AI decisions such as data quality, bias, ethics, and privacy. Based on our findings, we hope to provide insights into the interplay between people, landscapes, and contexts surrounding AI projects that influence decision making within different industries.

# 2.Terminology and Concepts
Before diving into the specifics of AI projects, it is important to establish some basic concepts and terms used throughout the field. The following list outlines some commonly encountered terms and concepts when dealing with AI development:

1. Data: Data refers to raw facts or information collected from various sources including structured, unstructured, semi-structured, and encrypted data formats. It includes both primary source data and derived data that has been processed through algorithms. Primary source data comes directly from users while derived data is generated through computations based on primary source data. There are several types of data including text, image, audio, video, and numeric data. 

2. Data Science: Data science is a multi-disciplinary approach to solving complex problems using data. It involves gathering, cleaning, analyzing, transforming, and modeling data to gain meaningful insights and make predictions. Data scientists apply statistical methods, computer programming skills, domain expertise, and mathematical background to extract valuable insights from large datasets. They typically work closely with business owners, product developers, and other subject matter experts to develop sophisticated models that can accurately predict outcomes and drive businesses forward.

3. Machine Learning: Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that enables machines to learn without being explicitly programmed. In simpler words, machine learning is the process of allowing computers to automatically identify patterns and trends in data without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning systems can learn to recognize patterns in data and categorize incoming data into groups based on those patterns. These categories can be further classified into smaller subcategories known as clusters. Machine learning tools include neural networks, support vector machines, random forests, clustering algorithms, and regression algorithms. 

4. Deep Learning: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multiple layers of artificial neurons to create highly complex models that learn complex relationships between inputs and outputs. Deep learning systems have proven to achieve state-of-the-art results in many applications such as object recognition, speech recognition, and image classification. Some notable deep learning libraries include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Apache MXNet. 

5. Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP refers to the technology of enabling machines to interpret human languages. A wide range of NLP technologies exist ranging from sentiment analysis to named entity recognition to topic detection. NLP allows machines to understand and communicate with humans in real-time, which makes it critical for AI solutions that require human interactions. Common NLP libraries include NLTK, spaCy, and Gensim.

6. AI Platform: An AI platform is responsible for managing the entire lifecycle of AI projects from data collection to deployment and operations. It provides infrastructure, tools, and environments needed for building and training AI models. Examples of common AI platforms include AWS SageMaker, Microsoft Azure ML, Google Cloud AutoML, and IBM Watson Studio. 

7. Ethical Considerations: Ethical considerations include social responsibility, fairness, transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness. Each of these aspects contribute towards creating an environment where individuals can freely share ideas, experiences, and views regardless of prejudice. Ensuring that AI systems are ethically designed and implemented ensures they are fair, transparent, accountable, and trustworthy and safeguards against biases and exploitation. 

In conclusion, establishing a strong foundation in the above concepts and terms helps us better understand how AI projects are structured, operated, and driven by people, data, and context.
