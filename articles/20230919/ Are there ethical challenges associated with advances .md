Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning and deep learning techniques have been applied to various fields such as healthcare, finance, security, transportation, etc. In recent years, several developments have greatly enhanced the performance of these technologies. However, one of the main concerns is whether AI will result in a discriminatory impact on society. This article aims at exploring possible ethical challenges associated with advances in AI technology and identifying them for further research. We'll look into six major areas that are particularly critical:

1. Privacy & Security Challenges: The concern arises from the increased use of AI systems in sensitive domains such as healthcare and financial services, where personal information can be subject to serious privacy and security risks if not properly protected. 

2. Human-Centered Design: One core challenge faced by AI is its reliance on data without sufficient human oversight, which may lead to biases and errors. To address this problem, it is essential to conduct human-centered design practices during the development process, including user-centered design, involving people with different backgrounds, cultures, and lifestyles.

3. Societal Impact: Another issue involves social effects of AI, especially in terms of potential unfair or harmful outcomes such as unjustified job assignments, stereotypes being reinforced through algorithmic decision making, and data collection leading to bias and discrimination against certain groups of individuals. 

4. Responsible AI: Artificial Intelligence has the potential to enhance our lives, but we need to take responsibility for developing and using it responsibly. It's crucial to ensure that algorithms and models do not exacerbate existing systemic problems or punish minorities.

5. Ethics Gaps and Disputes: As AI becomes increasingly integrated into every aspect of our daily life, ethical issues related to technology development become more complex. There still remain significant gaps and disputes in defining and addressing these ethical concerns.

6. Public Policy & Government Interventions: Despite recent progress in artificial intelligence, governments and public policy agencies continue to focus primarily on how technology should improve economic growth rather than considering the implications of such advancement on society’s wellbeing and fundamental rights. 

This survey provides an overview of ethical challenges associated with advances in AI technology and identifies some avenues for further research. Within each area, specific examples are provided to illustrate the importance of these challenges and suggest ways to address them. Overall, this paper seeks to bring attention to the ethical aspects of AI development and provide guidance on how to identify, assess, and mitigate ethical risks.

# 2.基本概念术语说明
Privacy and security: Definition of privacy and security risks present in different industries, along with measures taken to protect sensitive data. 

Human centered design: User-centered design refers to a process of creating products and services with users' needs, preferences, and expectations in mind. It includes personas, scenarios, wireframes, prototypes, usability testing, feedback, and continuous improvement cycles. 

Societal impact: Societal impact refers to the negative consequences of any technological advancement, including positive ones like better quality of life, fairness in resource allocation, and improved efficiency. These impacts can range from negative to detrimental. 

Responsible AI: Responsible AI involves ensuring that algorithms and models do not exacerbate existing systemic problems or punish minorities. To achieve this goal, we need to consider factors like transparency, accountability, explainability, and justice.

Ethics gap: An ethics gap occurs when there remains a lack of consensus around ethical standards within a particular field. These differences could stem from conflicting norms, language barriers, or a lack of awareness among stakeholders. 

Public policy and government intervention: Public policy and government interventions often target societal issues related to jobs, education, health care, and housing. They aim to reduce or eliminate economic and social inequality while achieving benefits for majority stakeholders.
