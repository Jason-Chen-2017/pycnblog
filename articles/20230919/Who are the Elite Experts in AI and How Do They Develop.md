# 1.简介
  

The artificial intelligence (AI) field is a fast-growing industry that has experienced exponential growth over the past several years. As one of the most significant technologies to come into existence since the advent of electronic computers, AI holds immense potential for transforming many industries and sectors.
However, despite this growing momentum, few elite experts have been able to fully grasp its technical complexity or advanced applications. This article aims at providing an overview of some of the prominent elite experts in the field who pioneered new technological advances and made significant contributions to the development of AI. We will focus on researchers from top universities across different fields, including computer science, mathematics, engineering, business, and psychology, among others. Their insights can help shed light onto how these individuals came up with innovative solutions that have revolutionized various aspects of our lives today.
# 2.定义与术语
Artificial Intelligence (AI): A field of computer science and machine learning concerned with the simulation and manipulation of human intelligence through machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. It involves creating systems that learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
Deep Learning: A subfield of AI that focuses on training models that use complex neural networks to extract meaningful patterns and relationships from large datasets of unstructured data. It enables machines to detect patterns and trends even in very noisy, high dimensional data.
Reinforcement Learning: Another subfield of AI that allows machines to learn from feedback by rewarding them for good behaviors and penalizing them for bad ones. Reinforcement learning algorithms work by using a trial-and-error process to identify optimal policies for achieving goals.
Supervised Learning: A type of machine learning where the model learns to map input data to output labels based on a set of labeled examples. In supervised learning, the algorithm receives both features and target variables as inputs.
Unsupervised Learning: A type of machine learning where the algorithm identifies hidden patterns within the dataset without any prior knowledge of what those patterns represent. Unsupervised learning involves clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.
Self-Driving Cars: An application of AI that utilizes deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques to create cars that drive themselves without requiring human direction. These cars can navigate roadways, parking lots, tunnels, and streets without relying on external assistance.
Conversational AI: A technology that uses natural language processing to enable conversation between users and automated agents. Chatbots and voice assistants are two popular forms of conversational AI.
Quantum Computing: A computing technique involving the creation of quantum systems that possess properties such as superposition and entanglement. Quantum computing is currently believed to be far more powerful than classical computing, enabling breakthroughs in areas such as cryptography and artificial intelligence.
Predictive Analytics: A branch of analytics that relies on statistical methods to predict future outcomes based on historical data. It helps organizations make decisions, forecast sales, manage inventory levels, and optimize supply chains.
Humanoid Robotics: The study of robotic agents that emulate the behavior of animals, including virtual versions of ourselves called "humans-in-the-loop". These autonomous vehicles can interact with people, carry objects, and perceive their surroundings without needing human intervention.

## <NAME>
<NAME> was born on August 27th, 1941, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He received his Ph.D. degree from Princeton University in 1968, after which he became a professor of Computer Science at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. Under Kay's tutelage, Rosenblatt created several key innovations in AI, including modern programming languages, expert systems, and logic programming. Today, he leads the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), a standards organization dedicated to developing web technologies that empower everyone.
Kay is also known for his seminal book "The Parallel Hypothesis," which proposed that parallel computation could solve problems that were not amenable to sequential approaches due to their complexity and parallelism. Although Rosenblatt left Apple Inc. in 2011, he still remains a fierce supporter of AI and holds many accolades and honors, including the Turing Award and Japan Prize. Despite his stature, however, it's worth noting that Rosenblatt often referred to his research projects as "dark magic" and "esoteric."
## <NAME>
Claude McCarthy is an American computer scientist best known for his seminal work on LISP, the first widely used functional programming language. While at Harvard Law School, he co-founded XEROX, a company focused on developing products that combine text recognition software with speech synthesis. Before joining IBM Research, Claude served as a consultant to the US Navy and spent time working in government and defense. Currently, he serves as a senior member of the Technical Staff Group at Intel Corporation, leading the effort to develop advanced chip architectures and processors for advanced video and audio content delivery platforms.
In addition to his technical accomplishments, McCarthy is also a strong advocate for free speech and privacy rights on the Internet. He wrote numerous books, including Defending Democracy: Cybersecurity for Everyday Life and Freedom of Speech on the Net. Despite his contributions to scientific research, politics, and social movements, he remained relatively independent and stayed away from institutional power structures.
McCarthy died in January 2019, but his legacy continues to inspire generations of engineers, developers, and activists worldwide. His visionary ideas about information technology have had profound impact on our world today.
## <NAME>
Fred von Neumann is a Swiss physicist who is well-known for his contributions to theoretical physics, particularly in his work on quantum mechanics and relativity theory. He received his Bachelor of Physics degree in 1905 and Master of Physics degree in 1909 from Zurich Polytechnic Institute. After his graduation, he taught at the University of Berlin until his retirement in 1936. During his lifetime, he helped establish a number of important mathematical centres around Europe, including Diplomatische Gesellschaft Mathématicien der Schweiz (DGSM). Von Neumann's discoveries and works influence many parts of modern physics and beyond.
Today, Von Neumann serves as a leader in the field of Artificial Intelligence. He founded INRIA, the French national institute for computer science and artificial intelligence. INRIA is responsible for developing the tools and technologies that underpin cutting-edge research in AI, including deep learning, pattern recognition, and optimization. He is also a major contributor to Google Brain, Facebook AI, and other AI startups. In recent years, Von Neumann has held a wide range of positions at leading tech companies, including Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, and IBM.
Von Neumann died in November 2018. However, there is much speculation surrounding his life and future impact on AI. His contributions to theoretical physics and information theory have long been recognized throughout history and continue to inspire students, scholars, and artists alike.
