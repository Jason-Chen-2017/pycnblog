Reinforcement learning (RL), also known as artificial intelligence (AI), is a machine learning technique that enables machines and agents to learn from experience rather than being explicitly programmed. RL involves training an agent using feedback from the environment in real-time to maximize cumulative rewards over time. The goal of reinforcement learning is to find optimal actions through trial and error by interacting with its surroundings and receiving reward or punishment based on its action. This leads to gradually improving decision making ability over time. In this article we will discuss how to design and implement AI systems using Reinforcement Learning techniques. 

In short, RL is a type of Machine Learning algorithm that uses trial and error method to solve complex problems and achieves near-optimal solutions. It learns about its environment through trial and error interactions between the agent and the environment, and then adjusts itself accordingly to improve performance. In RL, the agent interacts with its environment via states, observations, actions, and rewards, which are continuously fed into the agent to make decisions. Based on these inputs, the agent learns to take the best possible action at each point in time to maximize future rewards.

## Markov Decision Process（MDP）
A Markov decision process (MDP) is a mathematical framework used to model decision-making processes in dynamic environments where outcomes depend on previous state and actions taken. MDP consists of four main components:

1. State space: A set of all possible states that can be encountered while navigating the environment.

2. Action space: A set of all possible actions that can be performed during any given state transition. Actions may include moving forward, turning left, taking some other action such as drinking water etc.

3. Reward function: Defines the reward obtained after performing an action within a particular state. It provides the basis for evaluating the agent's performance.

4. Transition probabilities: Determines the probability of transitioning from one state to another state when an action is taken under a particular condition. Probabilities can be learned automatically from experience or they can be assigned manually depending upon the complexity of the problem.

The objective of an MDP is to determine the optimal policy that maximizes the long term reward over time, i.e., it determines what actions should be taken to reach the most rewarding state starting from any given state. Optimal policies do not necessarily exist and many times multiple policies can lead to same outcome, but there exists only one globally optimal policy. To find the optimal policy, we use various algorithms like Dynamic Programming, Monte Carlo Tree Search, Q-Learning, etc. All these algorithms rely on finding value functions and policies. Value function represents the expected discounted return of starting from any given state, whereas Policy defines the sequence of actions to be followed from current state to next state.

We can illustrate the basic working principle of an RL agent using a simple example. Suppose you have started playing a game called "Pong". Players need to move their paddle to hit the ball towards the opponent’s side without getting stuck in the walls. Your task is to keep your paddle inside the frame of the screen so that the ball reaches the opponent’s side before it goes out of bounds. How would you approach this problem? 

One way could be to train an agent to imitate human behavior. You start by giving the agent a brief instruction on how to play the game, say “Move the paddle towards the opponent’s center.” Then, you let the agent go through several trials and record the actions taken by both players along with the immediate rewards received. Once enough data has been collected, you assign different weights to different actions based on the frequency of occurrence and update them until the agent starts picking actions that yield maximum score. By doing this, the agent begins to learn to play the game autonomously. However, since the agent relies solely on training data, it cannot discover new strategies or adapt quickly to changes in the environment. Thus, it may fail to perform well in unforeseen situations. Therefore, more advanced methods such as deep reinforcement learning, Q-learning, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and AlphaGo are often preferred. These approaches allow us to build robust, capable agents that can handle varying levels of difficulty and interact with the environment in real-time.
