With the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies over the years, many businesses are turning to advanced algorithms and computational models to automate processes such as fraud detection, credit scoring, and transaction authorization. As a result, banks have become increasingly dependent on these tools for their day-to-day operations, which raises concerns about security risks associated with the use of artificial intelligence. However, some cybersecurity professionals believe that using AI-powered systems will not pose any significant risk to banking institutions’ data security. In this article, we provide an in-depth analysis of how cybersecurity experts see the potential risks and benefits of utilizing AI for financial transactions and make recommendations for banks and other financial organizations to be cautious when adopting AI technology for these purposes.

# 2.基本概念及术语
Before discussing the potential risks and benefits of utilizing AI for financial transactions, let's first go through some basic concepts and terminology related to AI and finance:

1. Artificial Intelligence (AI): The term "artificial intelligence" refers to machines capable of performing tasks that would usually require human intelligence. These machines can learn from experience, making them more like human beings than actual computers. There are several subcategories of AI, including machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, among others. 

2. Machine Learning: The task of machine learning is to allow machines to learn automatically by feeding them examples of input data and producing outputs similar to those seen during training. It involves teaching machines to recognize patterns in data and make predictions based on new information.

3. Financial Transactions: Financial transactions refer to the process of buying or selling assets. They include stock purchases, mortgage loans, brokerage services, insurance premium payments, deposits, withdrawals, and payroll procedures. Traditionally, financial transactions were conducted manually by people who had knowledge about the market trends, rates of interest, and the financial laws applicable to each type of transaction. With the development of automated transaction systems, companies can now offer personalized products and services to their customers based on their past behavior, preferences, and demographics, leading to enhanced customer engagement and satisfaction.

4. Cybersecurity Expert: A cybersecurity expert is someone involved in information security management, risk assessments, threat modeling, vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, intrusion detection, and post-intrusion activities. He/she typically has extensive experience working in various industries, ranging from telecommunications, government agencies, and financial institutions, to research labs and startups.

Now let's discuss the core algorithm used for fraud detection, credit scoring, and transaction authorization, along with the steps involved in integrating it into the existing system, and how its mathematical formula works.

Fraud Detection Algorithm: This algorithm uses statistical methods to identify suspicious activity within financial transactions. It identifies patterns that are indicative of fraudulent activity, such as repeated purchases or high amounts transferred within a short time period. For example, if a user suddenly makes multiple purchases within a short amount of time, it could potentially indicate a fraudulent transaction. It then analyzes the context surrounding the detected anomaly and attempts to determine whether it was caused by a legitimate user action or a botnet attack.

Credit Scoring Algorithm: The credit scoring algorithm takes into account factors such as the history of past transactions, demographic characteristics, financial status, and location to predict the probability of default or good credit. Banks often use this tool to monitor and manage their client base effectively, identifying defaulters before they cause serious problems for their business. The accuracy of this model varies depending on the size, nature, and quality of the dataset used to train the algorithm.

Transaction Authorization Algorithm: This algorithm allows banks to authorize or decline transactions on behalf of users based on their past transaction history, identity verification, and previous approval ratings. It helps reduce manual intervention required to approve transactions and improve overall efficiency. Additionally, it provides additional confidence to users and reduces transaction fees.

Operational Steps: Integrating the above mentioned AI-based algorithms requires implementing them within the current systems and workflows. Here are the general steps involved:

1. Data Collection: Collect historical transaction data from all sources, including online payment gateways, mobile apps, and third-party processors. Ensure that there is a balance between diversity and quantity of data collected so that the algorithm doesn't suffer from biased outcomes.

2. Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to remove irrelevant details, outliers, and noise. Convert categorical variables into numerical form so that the algorithms can understand them. Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate performance and ensure model robustness.

3. Feature Engineering: Extract features that correlate with the outcome variable (fraud, authorized transaction). Use domain knowledge to create relevant features that complement the available data. Treat missing values and imbalanced classes accordingly while preprocessing the data.

4. Model Training: Train the chosen machine learning algorithm on the preprocessed dataset. Choose appropriate hyperparameters and regularization techniques to optimize performance. Monitor the model's performance and retrain as needed until satisfactory results are obtained.

5. Model Deployment: Once the model has been trained and validated, deploy it in real-time production environments to enable immediate response to incoming fraudulent transactions. Monitor and maintain the system continuously to prevent performance degradation.

6. Continuous Monitoring and Improvements: Continuously monitor the performance of the system and update the models periodically to detect and correct errors. Look for areas where the model isn't meeting expectations and fine-tune the model parameters to address the issues. Eventually, integrate feedback loops across different teams to build better solutions together.

Mathematical Formula: Mathematically speaking, the logistic regression function can be described as follows:

$$P(y=1|x)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0+\beta^Tx)}}$$

where $y$ is either 0 or 1 representing a negative class or positive class respectively; $\beta$ represents the coefficients vector of features x; and $x$ represents the independent variables vector. The sigmoid function maps inputs to probabilities [0,1]. The formula calculates the likelihood of having a positive class given the input feature vector $x$, taking into account the weight vector $\beta$. Intuitively, if the output is close to 1, it means that the probability of being in the positive class is very high. If the output is close to 0, it means that the probability of being in the negative class is very high. Therefore, by adjusting the weights vectors $\beta$, we can increase or decrease the impact of each feature on the decision-making process, leading to improved accuracy.
