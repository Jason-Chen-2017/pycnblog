## 2.1. Deep Learning
Deep learning refers to an AI technique where multiple layers of artificial neurons interconnected by weights are used to recognize patterns within data. Neural networks are constructed using an iterative process that adjusts the connections between nodes according to the result of previous computations. This approach enables machines to learn complex relationships between input data and target outputs, making it particularly suitable for pattern recognition tasks like object detection and segmentation. These systems typically use feedforward neural networks (FNN) consisting of fully connected layers, which are optimized for classification tasks. However, there exist other types of neural networks that differ in architecture, topology, activation functions, regularization mechanisms, etc. Some popular deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Caffe. Together they make up the current dominant paradigm for building deep learning systems.


## 2.2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
A typical structure of a convolutional neural network consists of alternating convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers at the end. Each layer performs operations on its respective inputs to extract features. A convolutional layer applies filters to the input image to extract spatial features, while a pooling layer reduces the dimensionality of the output feature maps by combining adjacent regions. The number of filters applied to each region depends on the depth of the model and can be adjusted to control the complexity of the extracted representation. Similarly, the size of the filter is also hyperparameters that need to be tuned based on the problem at hand. Fully connected layers apply non-linear transformations to the flattened feature vectors obtained after all layers and produce final predictions. The diagram below shows the basic structure of a CNN: 



In order to increase the effectiveness of CNNs in medical imaging applications, they are often augmented with additional layers such as batch normalization, dropout, and residual connections. Batch normalization helps prevent overfitting by normalizing the activations of intermediate layers to zero mean and unit variance during training. Dropout randomly drops some units from the input to reduce overfitting. Residual connections add the input directly to the output of a block of layers instead of passing through additional layers. This allows the model to learn more complex representations by directly minimizing the error compared to the identity function. For instance, the identity mapping x → f(x) + x leads to better generalization compared to just passing through f(x). Overall, CNNs provide powerful tools for extracting visual features from medical images that enable us to build robust and accurate classifiers.


## 2.3. Residual Networks (ResNet)
ResNet was introduced in 2015 by He et al. It offers significant improvements over conventional CNN architectures due to two key properties: skip connections and identity mappings. Skip connections allow a deeper network to quickly converge to higher accuracy by skipping layers that do not contain much trainable parameters. Identity mappings help avoid the vanishing gradient problem when the signal flows backwards from earlier layers. The original ResNet architecture contains three stacked blocks with increasing depth, which together form a deep network that can accurately capture complex functions in noisy environments. The figure below shows the overall architecture of a ResNet model: 


To further improve the performance of ResNet, variants called wide and resizable networks have been proposed. Wide networks apply larger filters than in traditional CNNs, allowing them to learn rich but sparse representations. Resizable networks resize the feature maps by performing global average pooling before computing the classifier output. They trade off computational efficiency for increased representational capacity. 


## 2.4. Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)
Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks were first proposed in 1997 by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber. They offer improved performance over traditional RNNs by addressing the vanishing gradients issue caused by recursive calculations, adding gating mechanisms, and allowing information to persist across time steps. An LSTM cell consists of four gates: forget gate, input gate, output gate, and candidate hidden state. At each time step, the input gate controls whether new values are added to the cell state; the forget gate controls which values to discard; the output gate controls what information to emit; and the candidate hidden state represents the combined input, old state, and bias terms. The output is produced by taking a linear combination of the cell state and a tanh activated output gate. The LSTM cells interact sequentially to preserve relevant information even though the dependencies between samples are typically limited. Since they operate over entire sequences rather than individual elements, LSTMs are well suited for sequence prediction tasks such as natural language processing and speech recognition. 


## 2.5. Transfer Learning
Transfer learning is a fundamental concept in machine learning. It involves transferring knowledge learned from one task to another related task to accelerate training speed and improve model accuracy. Traditional transfer learning techniques involve either full finetuning of the pre-trained model or selectively freezing certain layers and training only a small portion of the network. However, many recent works propose specialized transfer learning strategies that combine ideas from different sources. One promising strategy is domain adaptation, which aims to transfer knowledge acquired from a source domain to a target domain with potentially very different characteristics and distributions. Domain adaptation usually involves training a shared base network on a source dataset while initializing the last few layers with random weights, then fine-tuning the rest of the network on the target dataset using backpropagation. Another strategy is catastrophic forgetting, which involves gradually replacing old memories with new ones as the network adapts to new situations. By storing the most recent versions of the network's weights, catastrophic forgetting helps prevent the network from losing critical information about previous experiences and recovering slowly as new information becomes available. 


## 2.6. Fine-Tuning Strategies
Trained deep neural networks tend to perform well on a particular task given enough training data. However, transfer learning does not guarantee good performance on previously seen test cases since the new task may require slightly different features or labeling scheme. To handle this challenge, there are several fine-tuning strategies that aim to adapt the pre-trained model to the new task:

1. Partial Finetuning: Instead of fine-tuning the whole network, we can only update the last few layers while keeping the early layers fixed. This ensures that the early layers still capture low level features, which are crucial for recognizing simple objects like edges, corners, and textures. 

2. Feature Extractor Training: In addition to updating the last few layers, we can also replace the classifier part of the network with a custom head, effectively turning the pretrained network into a feature extractor. This can be useful if we want to fine-tune the last few layers of a pre-trained model on a different dataset without changing the actual classifier.  

3. Self-Supervised Learning: Instead of relying solely on labeled examples, self-supervised learning uses unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels and incorporate them into the loss function to guide the optimization process. By leveraging prior knowledge about the distribution of data, contrastive divergence can be used to train a shared embedding space that captures semantically similar features regardless of the presence of paired labeled examples. 

4. Knowledge Distillation: Once the pre-trained model is frozen, we can substitute the softmax layer with a lightweight logistic regression layer that predicts the class probabilities directly from the penultimate feature vector. This enables us to leverage the pre-trained model’s ability to discriminate among different classes and implicitly optimize a separate student classifier. Additionally, we can employ temperature scaling to smooth the predicted probability distributions and remove any ambiguity caused by dynamic ranges.  



# 3.核心算法原理及具体操作步骤
## 3.1. Preprocessing Pipeline
Before training the deep learning models, a preprocessing pipeline needs to be implemented to transform raw pixel intensities into appropriate numerical formats. The following steps summarize the necessary steps involved in implementing this pipeline: 

1. Data Augmentation: Generally, it is important to expand the training set by generating new variations of existing data points. This can help the model generalize better to unseen data and counteract the overfitting problem. Various data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, flip, zoom, shifting, noise, color jittering, brightness adjustment, and cropping, can be applied to the training data to create expanded training sets.

2. Normalization: Pixel intensity values vary between different modalities, scales, and acquisition protocols. Therefore, it is essential to normalize the input data to ensure consistent weight updates and reliable convergence. Common normalization techniques include min-max scaling and z-score scaling. Min-max scaling converts the input values to the range [0,1] while z-score scaling subtracts the mean and divides by the standard deviation. 

3. Label Encoding: Categorical variables must be converted into numerical format so that they can be fed into the neural network. Popular encoding schemes include one-hot encoding, ordinal encoding, and hashing trick. One-hot encoding assigns a binary value to each category, whereas ordinal encoding sorts categories into ordered integers. Hashing trick converts categorical variables into unique integer codes. 

4. Data Splitting: The input data needs to be split into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model. Typically, 80% of the data is used for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. It is common practice to shuffle the data randomly before splitting to minimize potential biases.

5. Input Transformation: As mentioned above, the input data must be transformed into appropriate numerical formats for the deep learning models. Most commonly used models include convolutional neural networks (CNN), densely connected networks (DNN), and recurrent neural networks (RNN). DNNs consist of fully connected layers while CNNs consist of convolutional layers followed by pooling layers. RNNs take sequential input sequences and capture temporal dependencies using feedback loops. While DNNs can easily handle variable length input sequences, CNNs are designed specifically for handling gridded inputs and have fewer restrictions on input shape. For example, for CT scans, a 2D slice of the patient's body can be processed as a grayscale image. On the other hand, a series of 2D slices taken along a coronal view could be represented as a volumetric tensor. Thus, CNNs are more efficient for handling medical imaging data and could lead to significant improvements over traditional DNNs. 

6. Oversampling: It is sometimes beneficial to balance the positive and negative class sizes by oversampling the smaller class or undersampling the larger class. Oversampling can be achieved by replicating instances from the underrepresented class or creating synthetic instances via interpolation. Synthetic instances can be created using generative adversarial networks (GANs) that generate fake images that look realistic but are actually generated from a discriminator network. GANs have shown promise for synthesizing medical images and have made strides towards solving the problem of class imbalance in medical imaging tasks. 

After completing the preprocessing pipeline, we can proceed to design the deep learning models that will be used to classify the input data. 

## 3.2. Designing Custom Models
There are several ways to design custom deep learning models for medical imaging applications. Here are some possible approaches:

1. Classification Model: The simplest type of model is a multiclass classification model that takes in raw pixel intensities and produces a single label indicating the class of the input data point. Examples of such models include support vector machines (SVMs), k-nearest neighbors (KNNs), decision trees, and random forests.

2. Segmentation Model: A segmentation model is responsible for producing a mask or polygon that delineates the boundaries of the input data point. Examples of such models include fully convolutional networks (FCNs), U-nets, and dilated convolutional networks (DCNs). FCNs consist of convolutional layers, upsampling layers, and skip connections that connect corresponding encoder and decoder paths. U-nets can be considered as a special case of a skip connection FCN that operates symmetrically on both ends of the U shape. Dilated convolutional networks consist of dilated convolutions that increase the receptive field of the underlying feature detectors, resulting in more precise localization of boundary features.

3. Regression Model: A regression model estimates a continuous quantity associated with the input data point. Examples of such models include multi-task neural networks (MTNNs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), and cycleGANs. MTNNs consist of multiple heads that share the same input feature representation, leading to better generalization ability. VAEs encode the input data into a low dimensional latent space and sample from it to reconstruct the original data. CycleGANs can be used to learn bidirectional relationships between pairs of images by simultaneously training a generator network and a discriminator network. During inference, the generator generates synthetic images that appear similar to the true images but come from a different domain.

4. Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE): An AAE is a hybrid deep learning model that combines autoencoding and adversarial learning techniques. The encoder learns to compress the input data into a compact latent space while the decoder learns to reconstruct the original data. The discriminator network evaluates the quality of the compressed latent space and tries to distinguish between real and fake samples. The goal of the AAE is to jointly optimize the encoder and discriminator networks to minimize the reconstruction error and maximize the discriminator loss, respectively. AAEs have shown impressive performance for denoising, anomaly detection, and synthesis of missing data.

Overall, choosing the right model for your medical imaging application requires careful consideration of the nature of the input data and the desired output. Depending on the complexity of the problem, you might need to experiment with different combinations of models to see which one achieves optimal performance.
