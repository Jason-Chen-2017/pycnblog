Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the way we work with machines, helping us to make decisions that were previously impossible or extremely complex. With its widespread adoption across various fields such as healthcare, finance, transportation, retail, energy, etc., it is becoming increasingly important for businesses to think about how they can use AI effectively and ethically. Moreover, recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to many applications where human decision-making processes are being replaced by machine learning algorithms. However, as AI systems become more integrated into our daily lives, there is an urgent need to ensure their fairness, accountability, and transparency. The aim of this paper is to review existing literature on fairness, accountability, and transparency concerns related to AI-based decision-making processes and propose a systematic approach to audit these considerations from both technical and societal perspectives. In particular, we will provide a clear understanding of current best practices around assessing and mitigating biases in machine learning models and then identify appropriate mechanisms and techniques to implement fairness measures within the context of AI-enabled decision-making processes. We will also discuss approaches towards developing trustworthy AI systems that are capable of adhering to social norms and institutional guidelines and aligning with global standards of transparency, explain why having strong notions of bias and ethics could be critical to successful development of AI-based decision-making processes, and present case studies illustrating the importance of designing transparent, accountable, and fair AI-based decision-making processes. Finally, we will conclude with a discussion of future directions and opportunities for research in this field. This article is based on a thorough reading comprehension exercise by two independent reviewers covering relevant areas of expertise and knowledge. We would like to thank them for their valuable comments and suggestions throughout the process.

## 2.1 Fairness
Fairness refers to a set of principles intended to maintain equal opportunties among different individuals, groups, or items, including race, gender, age, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, disability status, or other protected characteristics. It is essential for any AI algorithm to operate within legal and regulatory constraints on data collection, processing, storage, and distribution to protect individual privacy and promote equity and justice in all aspects of society. While some of these principles may seem intuitive or obvious at first glance, they are rarely explicitly addressed during the evaluation and testing phases of model development. 

In traditional statistical classification problems, fairness concerns involve ensuring that classes are represented fairly when classifying new examples using predictive accuracy metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. In addition to the accuracy metric, several papers have proposed methods to measure unfairness, such as disparate impact analysis and calibration curves. These methods typically require access to sensitive attributes of individuals, which cannot always be collected easily and are often associated with unwarranted risk. To address these issues, recent works have introduced techniques such as resampling, differential fence construction, and demographic parity constraints to evaluate and reduce unfairness in machine learning models. Despite their significant contributions, however, most of these techniques are focused on post-hoc adjustments to improve performance metrics rather than creating fully automated solutions to maintain fairness during training and deployment. Therefore, establishing a complete framework to measure and monitor fairness through continuous monitoring remains a challenging task.  

## 2.2 Accountability
Accountability means knowing who or what made certain decisions and exerted a specific influence on the outcome of a system. Machine learning systems face substantial risks of overfitting or manipulating data to achieve high levels of accuracy. Understanding exactly how each input feature influenced the output prediction requires tracking every step taken by the system alongside the corresponding outputs. Furthermore, since the goal of AI systems is to automate decision making, it becomes crucial to ensure transparency, meaning that people involved in the decision-making process should understand how the final decision was reached and why. One approach to build trust in AI systems involves providing sufficient information and documentation on the architecture, components, and processes used in the model creation, implementation, and operation phase. To further strengthen accountability, it is necessary to establish clear roles and responsibilities for individuals involved in building, maintaining, and operating the models. By documenting provenance and handling errors appropriately, developers can be held accountable for their actions while still promoting transparency.

## 2.3 Transparency
Transparency refers to the degree to which a system makes public its inner workings so that it is possible to inspect, scrutinize, and critique its behavior. Publicizing detailed specifications of the system’s architecture and implementation allows others to verify the accuracy and completeness of the underlying assumptions. Explainable AI systems, for example, rely heavily on interpretable models, which allow users to gain insights into the reasoning behind predictions made by the model. Although such techniques offer benefits such as better user experience and enhanced trust in AI systems, they do come at a cost in terms of increased complexity and time required for debugging and maintenance. To maintain full transparency, companies must clearly communicate the purpose and functions of their AI tools, publish code and datasets, and enable interdisciplinary collaboration between multiple departments. In summary, ensuring transparency and accountability requires careful consideration of the practical implications of the technology and the role of stakeholders in shaping its development and deployment.
