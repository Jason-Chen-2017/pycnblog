# 1.简介
  

Industrial automation has always faced great challenges in achieving sustainable profitability and improving productivity levels. In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based technologies have emerged as a new solution for industry 4.0 revolutionizing the way we work with machines, data, and systems. However, there is still much work to be done before Industrial Automation can fully benefit from this technology. The primary objective of this article is to highlight some of the key research advances that were made by experts within the field of Industrial Automation and Control using AI Techniques. These developments will not only improve performance but also increase flexibility, reliability, robustness, and resilience of an industrial system. 

Industry 4.0 refers to an era where machines and robots are increasingly integrated into complex manufacturing processes requiring intelligent controls. This requires breaking down traditional industrial silos, such as information management, process control, operation, quality assurance, maintenance, and human resources, all of which play important roles in optimizing efficiency, cost reduction, and productivity. Within this context, it becomes essential to leverage powerful AI algorithms to automate decision-making, optimize resource allocation, reduce downtime, manage inventory levels, detect anomalies, etc., resulting in improved accuracy, speed, and precision in tasks critical to meeting today's needs while keeping costs under control.

* **Intelligent Control**: Intelligent control refers to automated decision making mechanisms that use computer models or mathematical formulas to automatically generate optimized control actions. It involves combining sensors, actuators, processors, and other hardware components to achieve desired outcomes through supervisory control loops.
* **Machine Learning** : Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves developing software systems that can learn from experience without being explicitly programmed. By learning, machine learning algorithms build on prior knowledge to make predictions about new situations based on patterns learned from training samples. Machine learning models can learn continuously, making them effective at handling rapidly evolving real-world scenarios. There are several types of machine learning algorithms, including classification, regression, clustering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction.
* **Deep Neural Networks** : A deep neural network is a type of artificial neural network (ANN), consisting of multiple layers of connected nodes. Each node takes inputs, weights, and bias, performs activation functions, and passes its output to the next layer. Deep networks can model complex relationships between variables, enabling them to learn features beyond what was possible with shallower networks.
* **Reinforcement Learning** : Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that learns how to choose actions that maximize rewards over time. It uses a reward function to evaluate the agent’s behavior, incorporating feedback on its actions and receiving immediate reward or punishment. An agent interacts with the environment by taking actions, and receives a scalar reward based on its performance. The goal of reinforcement learning is to find optimal policies that map states to actions in an unknown environment so that the expected long term reward is maximized.
* **Deep Reinforcement Learning** : Deep reinforcement learning combines ideas from both machine learning and deep neural networks to create more complex agents capable of learning complex task policies. While traditional RL relies on handcrafted features extracted from raw observations, DRL exploits the ability of modern neural networks to extract abstract representations of the state space, allowing them to learn rich, high-level policies directly from pixels or other sensor input streams.
* **Convolutional Neural Networks** : Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are deep neural networks specialized for image processing and analysis. They apply filters to the input images to extract relevant features and patterns. CNNs are particularly useful when working with spatial or temporal data, such as videos, which typically consist of multidimensional arrays.
