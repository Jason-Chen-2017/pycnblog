Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized our lives in many ways, such as enabling self-driving cars to navigate through highways without human assistance, providing personalized recommendations on Amazon products, or recommending movies based on your likes and dislikes. However, with the emergence of new technologies like quantum computing and artificial intelligence models that can perform tasks similar to humans but at a much higher level of accuracy, it becomes more important than ever to establish a visionary for this new frontier where AI is developing into a major force driving innovation around us.  

However, despite the tremendous advances being made by researchers across all fields related to AI, including machine learning, deep learning, computer science, mathematics, and engineering, the task of creating a visionary that drives innovation remains a challenging one for most organizations. This article aims to provide an overview of how the field of Artificial Intelligence could benefit from a top-level leader who leads its research efforts in three key areas - packaging, industry, and commercialization. 

In particular, we will highlight how technology development organizations such as Google, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft could leverage their leadership skills and experience as well as collaborations with AI startups and incubators to enable the creation of breakthrough technologies in these domains. Moreover, we will explore various examples of how these companies have used their leadership abilities in order to create breakthrough solutions within each area while also leveraging their relationships with other partners like foundations, universities, and industry players. Finally, we will conclude by outlining several action items that would need to be taken in order to establish a visionary for AI's frontier. 

2.Background Introduction
The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been changing rapidly over the last decade. Among the recent developments, there are two main trends emerging: (i) the rise of deep neural networks (DNNs), which use large amounts of data to train complex mathematical functions, and (ii) the advancement of algorithms and techniques that allow machines to learn effectively in real time using just sparse or noisy input data. The ability to learn and adapt to different environments has made AI systems highly adaptable and capable of solving problems that were once considered impossible. These changes have led to significant improvements in numerous applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, decision making, fraud detection, and recommendation systems. Within this context, the AI frontier consists of three key areas - packaging, industry, and commercialization.

Packaging

One of the critical challenges facing AI today is the need for efficient and practical solutions for developers and engineers working with AI models. At present, packages such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Caffe, Keras, etc., have become the standard way of distributing DNNs for deployment in a wide range of scenarios. Despite the proliferation of packages, they still require expertise in software architecture, distributed system design, and programming languages to integrate them into existing applications and workflows. It is essential to ensure that these packages can efficiently run on edge devices and resource-constrained embedded platforms, especially those involved in mobile, IoT, and automotive applications. To address this challenge, one possible solution could involve the collaboration between hardware vendors, package creators, and AI experts to produce optimized libraries for specific types of devices and use cases. Another approach could involve integrating lightweight DNN inference engines directly into application code to reduce overall memory usage and increase execution speed.

Industry

Another crucial aspect of achieving a successful impact on the world of AI lies in optimizing the business model of companies that build AI applications. Since building AI tools involves iterative cycles of experimentation and testing, companies must invest heavily in quality assurance processes and testing infrastructure in order to identify bugs and issues early on. Additionally, companies must be able to monetize the value generated by their AI tools by selling subscriptions, custom features, or training services to end users. To achieve this goal, businesses may need to partner with industry experts to identify strategies for generating revenue streams from AI applications. Some potential avenues for doing so include offering API access to pre-trained models, promoting awareness about the benefits of AI tools and their role in enhancing customer experiences, and supporting regulatory compliance requirements. Furthermore, businesses should consider expanding their reach beyond traditional retail channels by integrating AI tools into e-commerce platforms, social media platforms, and messaging platforms to enable greater engagement and acquisition of customers.

Commercialization

Finally, the third key area of the AI frontier focuses on ensuring that AI systems are accessible to consumers in a variety of contexts, including telephony, voice assistants, virtual assistants, gaming, entertainment, healthcare, security, transportation, and others. Currently, there are few options available for developers to easily integrate AI models into consumer-facing applications due to legal, technical, and marketing challenges associated with deploying such models. For example, although some companies offer APIs for accessing pre-trained models, they typically do not make them immediately usable in non-cloud settings, leaving developers with limited options for integrating their AI solutions into their own apps. Similarly, marketing departments struggle to communicate the importance of AI to stakeholders and market segments, leading to slow adoption rates and cost overruns. Thus, it is essential for businesses to focus on leveraging AI technologies in combination with traditional marketing approaches to improve consumer engagement and satisfaction levels. One potential strategy could involve combining chatbots with live demonstrations of trained AI models to gain feedback and validate user needs before launching full-fledged solutions.
