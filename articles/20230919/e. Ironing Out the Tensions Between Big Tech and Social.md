Over the past few years, there has been a lot of hype around artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). In particular, large-scale applications such as Google’s self-driving cars have drawn strong reactions from both sides of society: on one hand, AI is becoming increasingly capable of acting autonomously in unexpected ways that could potentially benefit humanity; on the other hand, ML algorithms are responsible for vastly improving our lives by allowing us to automate repetitive tasks, which could lead to increased economic productivity or social wellbeing. Despite these benefits, however, many critics believe that this technology brings unfair advantages to certain groups at the expense of others. One example is recent research suggesting that algorithmic bias can be used to favor wealthy individuals over less fortunate ones when it comes to access to medical care or housing opportunities, while ignoring the disadvantageous effects this may cause to minorities.

In this article, we will attempt to address these concerns through an exploration of how big tech companies like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are engaging with communities they aim to support through their platforms. We will also explore what these organizations are hoping to achieve by leveraging technologies such as social media, artificial intelligence, and data analytics, and how they might use them to better serve those communities. Finally, we will consider potential challenges that come with leveraging these technologies and suggest strategies for mitigating these risks and ensuring that beneficial outcomes are achieved for all participants involved. 

Overall, this article aims to identify the tension between big tech companies and social good actors alike, and propose concrete strategies for working together to enhance positive social impact. This requires acknowledging the contradictions within the current system and proposing new avenues for collaboration that work towards creating more equitable systems for everyone.

# 2.Background Introduction
As mentioned earlier, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques has spurred significant interest across various sectors including healthcare, finance, transportation, education, and entertainment. However, the extent to which these technologies are being leveraged in various industries has not received much attention due to two critical factors. Firstly, the complexity of the task at hand makes it difficult for machines to effectively perform complex tasks like object detection and recognition, speech recognition, facial expression analysis, sentiment analysis, etc. Secondly, even with the right tools and frameworks, implementing high-quality solutions often require specialized knowledge, expertise, and resources which are not available in most developing countries. As a result, the value created by these technologies is limited to companies that can afford to invest heavily in talented engineers who can implement advanced AI models.

Additionally, several organizations claim to provide essential services and products to underprivileged communities, but fail to recognize the need for diverse perspectives and approaches when making strategic decisions regarding digital platforms, policies, and programmes. For instance, the United Nations Development Programme recently launched its own website to promote development efforts in low-income communities around the world and targeted similar initiatives in other regions. Nevertheless, this organization primarily relies upon donor funding, without any consultation or transparency into individual policies or practices. Similarly, Apple recently launched a campaign encouraging developers to build apps that are inclusive of different cultures and languages, yet fails to clearly define what constitutes "inclusive" or establish criteria for judging app quality based on accessibility features.

To address these issues, the founding fathers of the internet known as ARPANET made a commitment to connect every computer in the world using standard protocols. To maintain openness and security, the Internet was divided into multiple routing domains called subnets each consisting of hundreds or thousands of computers connected to switch routers throughout the world. It took decades for the first protocol stack – the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) – to be developed, tested, and deployed. Meanwhile, the growth of mobile devices and the emergence of cloud computing transformed networking from a physical hardware infrastructure into a software-based virtual environment. These changes brought new requirements and challenges for network operators, particularly regarding the creation and maintenance of secure networks that balance performance, scalability, and security needs while supporting heterogeneous application environments. The emergence of blockchain technology further pushed the boundaries of networking and introduced novel networking paradigms such as peer-to-peer (P2P) networking, where nodes exchange information directly rather than passing messages through gateways.

Since the advent of these technologies, big tech companies have attempted to leverage their market power to affect change in society. Some examples include the rise of social media giants like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube, which use user generated content to target advertising and sell subscriptions to premium content. Other companies like Amazon, Netflix, and Alibaba try to monetize user data by providing subscription-based streaming services and online gaming platforms. Moreover, some startups have launched venture backed businesses that focus on building products that benefit small communities, such as PeertoPeer Foundation that provides free WiFi to remote villages via microchips. Although these ideas are transformative, it is important to note that they carry risks as well. Increasing automation, censorship, and surveillance have led to widespread ethical concerns about privacy and security concerns related to data collection and usage. Additionally, while social movements such as Black Lives Matter have led to important changes in society, they are only part of a larger challenge surrounding inequality, poverty, corruption, and oppression that must also be addressed if we want to achieve long term social good.

These tensions between big tech companies and social good actors alike are central to understanding the role of AI and ML in shaping the future of our societies. The following sections will provide context for these companies' activities and discuss how they are tackling these problems.
