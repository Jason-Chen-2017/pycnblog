Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to a system that is capable of performing tasks or actions in a way that has never been done before by a human being. It encompasses several sub-fields such as Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and many more. The growth of this field has made it essential for businesses to embrace AI technologies because they are able to perform critical functions better than ever before. 

The introduction of Artificial Intelligence and its applications creates challenges in ensuring fairness, safety, transparency, accountability, security, privacy, etc., which requires organizations to develop robust policies and procedures around AI. Governance bodies play an important role in managing these issues, especially when dealing with a rapidly evolving technology landscape. In this article, we will discuss how ethical principles and guidelines can be used to establish fairer and safer AI governance practices at various levels. Specifically, we will focus on four main areas:

1. Policy development: This involves setting clear objectives, identifying stakeholders, developing strategies, budgeting, and overseeing implementation efforts. 

2. Data governance: This involves defining appropriate data policies, standards, and mechanisms to ensure data quality and integrity across all systems. 

3. Privacy regulations: This includes requirements related to protecting individuals' privacy from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, and misuse of personal information collected through AI systems.

4. Accountability: This involves creating transparent processes and institutions to ensure proper assessment, monitoring, and enforcement of AI systems. 

In order to effectively govern AI technology, it is crucial to understand the ethical implications of AI algorithms, techniques, and outcomes. Researchers have proposed multiple frameworks to address different aspects of ethical concerns in AI, including Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, Explainability, Responsible Decision Making, Security, and Privacy. However, even though there exists some consensus around ethical principles and guidelines, governance bodies still face numerous challenges in implementing them effectively, especially in the context of an increasingly complex AI ecosystem. Therefore, it is essential to leverage insights from expert practitioners and researchers in the area of AI governance to develop practical tools and methods to support effective management of the growing field of AI. Overall, governance bodies must take into consideration the social, cultural, economic, and environmental impacts of AI, as well as opportunities and risks associated with using it for decision-making and problem solving. By working together to design and implement effective AI governance policies, we can create safeguards against biases, errors, and harms caused by AI technology.

In conclusion, while ethical considerations are integral to the governance of AI technologies, governance bodies need to balance their commitment to excellence with the complexities of managing rapidly changing technology ecosystems. Practical solutions should include a combination of policy guidance, best practice recommendations, and new tools and techniques to promote responsible AI usage and governance. We believe that applying ethical principles and guidelines can significantly improve the effectiveness of governance processes in supporting the deployment of AI technologies in societies. Therefore, knowledgeable staff members with deep understanding of AI technologies, experience with applied ethical analysis, and proven track record of delivering successful programs should be engaged in developing governance structures and resources focused on addressing ethical issues around AI technology. With these considerations in mind, governance bodies can work towards achieving long-term sustainability and economic viability of the sector by taking into account the unique challenges posed by the rapidly expanding AI market. Ultimately, adopting ethical guidelines and principles as a foundation for AI governance can lead to significant improvements in the effectiveness of governance activities and accelerate the pace of technological change.
