Artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely used in many fields such as finance, healthcare, education, and industry. However, there are still limited research efforts exploring how AI can help improve social values or institutional arrangements with governance. In this paper, we review the literatures on AI-enabled social value systems and institutional arrangement designs with governance perspectives to provide a comprehensive understanding of how AI can be leveraged for social good.

The first part of our review will focus on theoretical foundations related to human emotions and social decision making using AI. We will discuss the different approaches, models, and applications of emotion recognition algorithms. Furthermore, we will explore how ethics principles embedded in these models influence AI’s decision-making process and what role societal norms play in shaping decisions made by machines. Finally, we will present new insights into creating ethical frameworks for AI-based social decision-making systems that account for social impact, fairness, transparency, and trustworthiness. 

In the second half of our review, we will cover the literature on how AI can contribute to building socially inclusive, equitable, and transparent institutions through legal designs. Specifically, we will address the interdisciplinary literature on lawsuits and enforcement mechanisms that utilize artificial intelligence technology. We will identify the implications of current legal regulations on AI-powered law suits, analyze existing lawsuits cases based on machine learning techniques, and propose future directions in improving the level of transparency and access to judicial resources through legal tools. Additionally, we will consider how AI can promote civic engagement and citizen empowerment through institutional designs.

By reviewing both theories of social values and institutional arrangements, AI, and governance, we aim to create an integrative framework that highlights the opportunities and challenges associated with applying AI technologies for social good. By analyzing multiple disciplines within the field of AI, legal, economics, psychology, sociology, and political science, we hope to generate a more holistic view of AI’s potential for transforming society and ensuring fairness, equality, and justice.

Our paper is divided into two main parts: Section 3 and Appendix A. 

Section 3 contains a detailed review of the various approaches, models, and applications of emotion recognition algorithms in theory and practice, including traditional emotion recognition methods and deep learning algorithms. It then presents a new perspective of creating ethical frameworks for AI-based social decision-making systems that account for social impact, fairness, transparency, and trustworthiness. In addition, it addresses the current state of legal regulations around AI-powered law suits and their impact on societies, case studies, and proposes future directions in improving transparency and access to judicial resources through legal tools. 

Appendix A includes information about citizenship and privacy rights, which is relevant to maintaining social justice and equity in AI-powered systems. Moreover, it provides an overview of the subject area covered in our review and some additional references.

Emotion recognition algorithms have played a crucial role in enabling computer vision applications in various domains such as face detection, speech recognition, etc., but they remain challenging for addressing the complex tasks involved in interpreting human emotions from facial expressions and language signals. Traditional emotion recognition algorithms use rule-based approaches that require manual training or tuning, while recent deep learning-based approaches attempt to learn the underlying features automatically from large amounts of data without explicit supervision. Despite significant advances in the last decade, the effects of AI on human emotions and social behavior remains controversial due to its potential negative consequences such as bias, polarization, and distortion. Nevertheless, it is essential to establish a clear understanding of these issues before envisioning new paradigms of AI-supported social decision-making systems. 

To capture the varying degrees of complexity and nuances of human emotions and sentiments, AI-based social decision-making systems often rely on computational models that jointly model the internal states of individuals along with external factors such as culture, time, space, and context. For example, when deciding whether to grant bail for a convicted criminal, AI-based systems may need to take into consideration the individual's reputation, background, cultural influences, past experience, and opinions towards the defendant, among others. As long as these variables cannot be fully captured by static rules, machines must rely on probabilistic inference techniques that reflect the uncertainty inherent in humans' emotions and make inferences based on personal preferences and desires. This approach requires the development of knowledge-based models that can extract implicit patterns and relationships from vast amounts of data to enable effective decision-making processes. 

Furthermore, as robots become increasingly capable and assistive devices become ubiquitous, people's interactions with them should not only lead to positive outcomes but also enhance the quality of life and well-being for all stakeholders. Therefore, accurate and reliable emotion recognition algorithms are critical for maintaining social bonds between people and robots, leading to improved human-robot collaboration and social interaction [1]. Similarly, lack of transparency and misleading information could result in harmful outcomes such as exaggerated stereotypes, pervasive prejudice, and unfair treatment of certain groups. To mitigate these risks, human-centered design principles such as transparency, explainability, and user control should guide the creation of AI-based social decision-making systems. Thus, the need for an ethical framework that incorporates these key elements becomes apparent.

Finally, the literature on building socially inclusive, equitable, and transparent institutions through legal designs continues to evolve rapidly. On one hand, technological advancements allow businesses to offer tailored services and products that appeal to diverse customer segments and lifestyles [2], leading to higher levels of service satisfaction, better brand awareness, and increased revenues. On the other hand, according to numerous studies, countries with advanced legal systems tend to have lower corruption rates, higher national economic growth, and reduced poverty rates [3] [4]. Accordingly, although governments today seem willing to invest billions of dollars in reforming existing institutions, much work remains to be done to ensure that these institutions serve everyone fairly and effectively. In order to achieve meaningful results, it is essential to develop new legal instruments that leverage AI technologies to support fairer rationales, enforce stronger compliance laws, and increase transparency and trustworthiness. 

Overall, our review aims to raise awareness about the intersection of AI, governance, and social values and institutional arrangements. Although there are many topics left to explore, we believe that the presented contributions provide a solid foundation for further research on AI-driven social decision-making systems that promote social justice, equity, and transparency.
