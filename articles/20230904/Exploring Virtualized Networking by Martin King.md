# 1.简介
  

Virtualization technologies have become increasingly popular over the past few years due to their ability to offer significant cost savings, improved efficiency and scalability of compute resources while also enabling virtual machines (VMs) to be easily moved across physical hardware platforms. This shift has led to a paradigm shift in how IT organizations approach network design, with traditional networking architectures being displaced by an emphasis on the creation of distributed networks that can span multiple locations and accommodate changing demands for services. 

The vast majority of today's enterprises are utilizing some form of virtualization technology in their network environments, whether it be VMware, Microsoft Hyper-V or OpenStack, but each enterprise is uniquely positioned within its own environment to determine which technologies best suit their needs. In this article we will explore virtual networking by reviewing core concepts and terminology as well as examining some of the most common virtual networking techniques used in modern enterprise networks. We'll then cover specific examples of various use cases such as data center networks, branch office networks and service provider networks. Finally, we'll discuss some future trends and challenges for virtual networking and suggest potential avenues for further research. Overall, our goal is to provide readers with a comprehensive overview of virtual networking and demonstrate how these technologies can help address key challenges faced by today's enterprises when implementing virtualized networks.

In addition to providing a technical understanding of virtual networking, this article aims to establish a better understanding of how these technologies fit into the broader IT industry landscape and what role they play in supporting mission-critical applications at scale. By analyzing both recent developments and upcoming trends in virtualization and networking, we hope to inspire other IT professionals and leaders to make critical decisions about the direction in which IT departments should invest their resources and how they should manage their network infrastructure to meet organizational objectives.

# 2.Concepts & Terminology
Before diving into the details of virtual networking, let's review some basic terms and concepts you need to know.
## 2.1 Network Functions Virtualization (NFV)
Network functions virtualization (NFV) refers to the deployment of software-defined networks (SDN) that abstract away the underlying network hardware and allow operators to deploy network functions through virtualized instances instead of actual hardware devices. NFV enables users to create networks where different types of network functions like firewalls, load balancers, and routers can be deployed as individual virtual appliances managed by centralized control planes. The resulting architecture allows for flexible scaling of network capacity based on demand without disrupting existing services.

A fundamental component of SDN is the controller that manages the configuration of network elements running inside virtual machines (VMs). These VMs run controlled software agents that communicate with one another using standard protocols like IP and Ethernet. The controller applies policies defined by the administrator to ensure network reliability and security, while ensuring that network traffic flows smoothly between VM endpoints according to predefined rules.

NFV offers several benefits compared to traditional static networking architectures:

1. Scalability: NFV networks can easily expand or contract depending on the amount of network traffic or the number of user requests. This makes them more efficient than static networks that require changes to the entire network structure whenever new services are launched or old ones retired.

2. Flexibility: NFV provides greater flexibility in network topology since service providers can define the arrangement of network components and connect them virtually rather than physically. Additionally, NFV simplifies the process of migrating workloads from one location to another as there is no need for manual intervention.

3. Cost-effectiveness: Reducing capital expenditure by leveraging economies of scale comes bundled with increased agility, flexibility, and reduced risk in NFV deployments. By reducing hardware costs, IT departments can save up to 75% compared to deploying similar networking capabilities manually.

4. Agile delivery model: With NFV, network functionality can be quickly changed without disrupting current service levels. Additionally, network updates can be made quickly and rolled out across the network without requiring downtime.

## 2.2 Software Defined Networking (SDN)
Software Defined Networking (SDN) refers to the methodology proposed by Stanford University Professor <NAME> in his seminal paper "Redefining Networking." He argued that networking hardware and protocols were becoming too complex, fragmented, and expensive to effectively deliver network services to businesses worldwide. To remedy this situation, he proposed building network abstractions that could be programmatically controlled using programming languages such as Python and Unix shell scripts. Instead of installing and configuring network devices directly, business units would deploy network services as virtual machines (VMs) controlled by a controller system that applied policies to ensure reliable and secure communications between the VM endpoints. This allowed for easier management, scalability, and automation of network services. Since then, SDN has been gaining prominence in the industry as it offers several advantages over traditional static networking models, including ease of deployment, scalability, and automation of network services.

Today, SDN solutions typically include three main components:

1. Control plane: The primary function of the control plane is to enforce network policies specified by the network administrator via API calls submitted to the controller. It does this by interacting with the switch hardware to manipulate forwarding tables and routing tables to implement the desired configurations.

2. Switch hardware: The switch hardware includes the switching fabric that connects end points together in the network. Each switch keeps track of the state of all the packets flowing through it and can apply routing and switching policies dynamically based on received information. 

3. Virtualization software: Virtualization software allows users to deploy network functions (such as firewalls, load balancers, and VPN tunnels) as standalone virtual machines that communicate with one another using standard protocols like IP and Ethernet. The controller system interacts with the VMs using APIs to configure and monitor their operation.

To summarize, SDN represents a fundamental shift in the way networks are designed and built. Traditionally, networking was done manually, with dedicated switches installed and configured by network engineers. However, SDN replaces this manual approach with dynamic control using automated software tools that apply policies to the network. SDN systems enable easy deployment, scalability, and automation of network services and can greatly reduce the complexity and expense of network operations. 

## 2.3 Hybrid Networks
Hybrid networks combine traditional wired and wireless networks in order to enhance overall network performance and security. A hybrid network consists of two or more types of networks working together seamlessly to provide both broadband and mobile connectivity. Common hybrid network architectures include: 

1. Wi-Fi and wired access: In this setup, clients connect either via wired ethernet or wireless LANs. 

2. Wired and wireless access: In this setup, clients connect via wired ethernet, with additional wireless coverage provided through Wi-Fi hotspots or base stations. 

3. Voice over WiFi: In this setup, voice communication over the Internet is carried over wireless connections using VoLTE or VoWiFi technologies.

While many organizations choose to leverage existing infrastructure to support their hybrid networks, others may opt to build their own networks completely from scratch using SDN technologies. Ultimately, hybrid networks aim to balance the strengths and weaknesses of each type of network and strike a balance between mobility, performance, and security requirements.
