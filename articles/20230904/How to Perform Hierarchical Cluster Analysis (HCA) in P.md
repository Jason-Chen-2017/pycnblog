# 1.简介
  

Hierarchical clustering is a popular method for organizing data into meaningful groups based on their similarities and differences. The basic idea behind hierarchical clustering is that we first group the objects into several clusters at different levels of similarity or dissimilarity until each cluster contains only one object. At each step, we merge two adjacent clusters with some criterion such as maximum distance or minimum number of members, which determines how closely related they are. This process continues until there is only one big cluster containing all objects. There are many variations of hierarchical clustering algorithms and techniques, but in this article, we will focus on a widely used technique called single-linkage clustering, which uses the shortest Euclidean distance between any pair of objects in the same cluster as the measure of cluster similarity.
In order to perform hierarchical clustering in Python using scikit-learn library, we need to follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries: numpy and sklearn.cluster.
2. Generate sample data points using numpy.random module.
3. Define the linkage criterion using scipy.spatial.distance.pdist function.
4. Apply the agglomerative_clustering() function from sklearn.cluster.hierarchical module to generate the dendrogram and the flat cluster labels.
5. Plot the dendrogram to visualize the hierarchy of clusters generated by hierarchical clustering.
Let's start our journey!
# 2. Basic Concepts and Terms
## 2.1 Dendrograms
A dendrogram is a tree-like diagram representing the arrangement of clusters produced by hierarchical clustering methods. Each leaf node represents a cluster, while non-leaf nodes represent intermediate merging events. In general, larger vertical branches denote greater separation between clusters, indicating higher level of similarity among them. Horizontal lines connecting branches represent increasing distances between pairs of clusters. When the horizontal line becomes very thick, it indicates that those two clusters are highly dissimilar and have formed a new merged cluster. Therefore, the goal of hierarchical clustering is to minimize the height of the dendrogram, i.e., to reduce the total intra-cluster variance within each sub-tree.
## 2.2 Distance Matrix
The distance matrix M is an N x N matrix where N is the number of data points and Mij = d(xi,xj), i.e., the Euclidean distance between point xi and point xj. We can use the pdist() function from the scipy.spatial.distance module to calculate the distance matrix efficiently for various distance metrics such as Manhattan, Euclidean, etc. By default, the pdist() function uses the Euclidean distance metric. However, other distance metrics may also be useful depending on the context. For example, if we want to cluster text documents based on their cosine similarity rather than their Euclidean distance, we can specify the "cosine" parameter when calling the pdist() function.
## 2.3 Linkage Criterion
The linkage criterion specifies the rule by which two clusters are merged together during the agglomerative clustering process. It is usually specified as either'single', 'complete', 'average' or 'weighted'. Single-linkage clustering involves selecting the closest pair of objects in each cluster and creating a new cluster with them. Complete-linkage clustering selects the farthest pair of objects and creates a new cluster with them. Average-linkage clustering combines the features of both single- and complete-linkage clustering. Weighted-linkage clustering takes into account the size of each cluster during the selection process. Finally, you can choose any custom linkage criteria as well by defining your own function and passing it to the linkage parameter of the agglomerative_clustering() function.
# 3. Algorithm and Operations
Here's how to perform hierarchical clustering using the single-linkage algorithm in Python:

``` python
import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial.distance import pdist, squareform
from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering

# Step 1: Generate Sample Data Points
np.random.seed(123)
X = np.random.rand(15, 2)

# Step 2: Calculate Distance Matrix
dist_matrix = squareform(pdist(X))

# Step 3: Define Linkage Criterion
linkage_method ='single'

# Step 4: Apply Agglomerative Clustering
model = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=None,
                                affinity='precomputed',
                                linkage=linkage_method)
labels = model.fit_predict(dist_matrix)

# Step 5: Visualize Dendrogram
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import dendrogram

plt.figure(figsize=(25, 10))
dendrogram(model.children_,
           orientation='left',
           labels=range(15))
plt.show()
```

In this code snippet, we first create a random set of 15 points with two dimensions using NumPy. Then, we calculate the distance matrix between each pair of points using SciPy's `pdist()` function and convert it into a condensed form using `squareform()`. Next, we define the linkage criterion as'single', which means that the two clusters being merged should be joined by the smallest possible distance between any two objects belonging to each cluster. We then apply the agglomerative clustering algorithm using Scikit-Learn's `AgglomerativeClustering` class and fit it onto the precomputed distance matrix obtained earlier. Lastly, we plot the resulting dendrogram using Matplotlib's `dendrogram()` function.

Note that since we're working with randomly generated data, the actual results of the clustering may vary slightly every time you run this code. Also note that the `affinity` parameter passed to the `AgglomerativeClustering()` function must be set to `'precomputed'` because we've already computed the distance matrix ourselves. If no linkage criterion is specified, the default value of 'ward' will be used instead. You can change this by setting the `linkage` parameter to another valid option such as 'complete', 'average', or 'weighted'.
