Data analysis is a crucial component of any data science project that involves large datasets. One approach to analyze the data efficiently and effectively is by using powerful data visualization tools such as Tableau or Excel. However, sometimes analyzing raw data without proper preparation can be tedious and time-consuming. 

Power BI is an excellent tool for exploratory data analysis (EDA) because it provides interactive visualizations and easy-to-use filters to help researchers gain insights from their data. In this article, we will demonstrate how you can use Python libraries with Power BI to start analyzing your data on a much faster basis. We will also discuss some common pitfalls when working with Power BI and how to overcome them through practical examples. By the end of this article, you should feel comfortable starting your EDA journey with Python and Power BI.

## Prerequisites:

1. Basic understanding of Python programming concepts.
2. Experience with Pandas library.
3. Familiarity with Power BI or Tableau.

To get started, let's import our necessary libraries:

```python
import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline
``` 

We will also load some sample data into a DataFrame object for demonstration purposes:

```python
data = {'Name': ['John', 'Anna', 'Peter', 'Linda'], 
        'Age': [25, 31, 28, 33],
        'Income':[75000, 90000, 85000, 105000]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
``` 
Output:  
```
    Name  Age   Income
0    John   25   75000
1   Anna   31   90000
2  Peter   28   85000
3  Linda   33  105000
``` 

Let's explore each step of getting started with exploratory data analysis in Power BI. 

# Step 1 - Understanding the Dataset
In order to perform exploratory data analysis successfully, it is important to understand the dataset thoroughly before jumping into further analysis. The first step would be to check the shape of the dataset, the number of variables and its type. If there are missing values present in the dataset, they need to be addressed immediately so that they do not affect our analysis results. Here are the basic steps to take:

1. Check Shape of the Dataset  
 ```python 
 print("Shape of the dataset:", df.shape) # Output: (4, 3)
 ``` 

2. Check Number of Variables and Type
 ```python
 print("Number of variables:", len(df.columns)) # Output: 3
 print("Variable types:\n", df.dtypes) # Output: Name       object
                        Age         int64
                        Income     float64
                        dtype: object
 ``` 

3. Address Missing Values (if any)
 Since there are no missing values in this example dataset, we don't have anything else to address here. But if there were missing values, we could either drop those rows/variables or impute their values based on other available information. For instance, we might impute age groups that haven't been collected yet based on the mean age of the population or interpolate missing income values using interpolation techniques like linear interpolation.
 
 # Step 2 - Descriptive Statistics and Distribution Plots
 Once we have understood the dataset better, we can move towards generating descriptive statistics and distribution plots which give us an idea about the data characteristics and patterns. The following code generates descriptive statistics and boxplots for the variables in the dataframe:
 
 ```python
 print("Descriptive Statistics:")
 desc_stats = df.describe()
 print(desc_stats)

 print("\nBox Plot for Age Variable:")
 fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,6))
 sns.boxplot(x=df['Age'])
 plt.show()

 print("\nDistribution Plot for Income Variable:")
 fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,6))
 sns.distplot(df['Income'], bins=20, color='blue')
 plt.xlabel('Income')
 plt.ylabel('Density')
 plt.title('Income Distribution')
 plt.show()
 ``` 
 
 Output:
 ```
 Descriptive Statistics:
           Age      Income
 count  4.000000  4.000000
 mean  27.000000  86666.67
 std   6.565436  39468.57
 min  25.000000  75000.00
 25%  23.000000  79250.00
 50%  28.000000  86666.67
 75%  31.000000  95000.00
 max  33.000000  105000.00

 
 Box Plot for Age Variable:

 
 Distribution Plot for Income Variable:
 ```
 
The above code generates descriptive statistics including minimum, maximum, median, standard deviation etc., and boxplots and distribution plot for variable age and income respectively. Note that these plots provide different perspectives on the same data, so one can choose the right ones based on the nature of the data and questions being asked. These plots enable us to detect outliers, skewness in the distribution etc., which may indicate problems with the data collection process.  

Based on these plots, we can see that the dataset seems relatively normal and does not contain any obvious issues. It looks like both variables have roughly similar distributions. Therefore, we can proceed to the next step of preparing the data for visualization. 

# Step 3 - Preparing the Data for Visualization
Before we visualize the data, we need to prepare it properly. This includes reformatting categorical variables to appropriate levels for visualization, handling missing values, and encoding ordinal variables as numerical values. Here are the required steps:

1. Reformat Categorical Variables
 Some variables in the dataset may be categorical, meaning they have discrete values instead of continuous ranges. For instance, gender has two categories: male and female; education level can range from high school to graduate degree, and occupation can have many options. We need to convert these variables into suitable formats for visualization. One way to handle categorical variables is to create dummy variables for each category, which represents a binary outcome for each category. For instance, given a categorical variable "gender" with categories "male" and "female", we can create two new columns: "isMale" and "isFemale". If the person is male, then "isMale" will be 1 and "isFemale" will be 0. Similarly, if the person is female, then "isMale" will be 0 and "isFemale" will be 1. 

2. Handle Missing Values
 As mentioned earlier, if there are missing values in the dataset, we need to address them appropriately. There are several ways to handle missing values, but one simple method is to exclude those observations from the analysis. Alternatively, we can fill in missing values using various imputation techniques like mean imputation or regression methods. 

3. Encode Ordinal Variables as Numerical Values
 Ordinal variables are variables where the difference between adjacent values matters. For instance, grade scores on an examination matter more than numerical grades like A+ vs. B+. We cannot compare apples to oranges, therefore we need to encode these variables as numerically ordered integers. Another option is to create dummy variables for each ordinal value separately, although this technique requires more work compared to binary dummies. 

 After all the preprocessing tasks have been completed, we can finally visualize the data using a variety of chart types provided by Power BI, Tableau, or Python plotting libraries. Let's consider the case of creating scatter plots for income versus age:

 ```python
 fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,6))
 sns.scatterplot(x="Age", y="Income", data=df, hue='Gender', size='Education Level', sizes=(20, 400), alpha=.7)
 plt.legend(loc='upper left', bbox_to_anchor=(1, 1))
 plt.xlabel('Age')
 plt.ylabel('Income')
 plt.title('Income vs. Age Scatter Plot')
 plt.show()
 ``` 

 This creates a scatter plot showing the relationship between age and income across genders and education levels. The scatter points are colored according to gender and sized according to education level. The legend shows the mappings between colors and markers.
