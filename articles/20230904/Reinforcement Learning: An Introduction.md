Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm that learns to make decisions in an environment by trial and error based on reward and punishment signals. The goal of RL is to learn to map complex situations to actions, so as to maximize cumulative rewards over time while minimizing undesirable outcomes or risks. The key concept in reinforcement learning is the agent-environment interaction loop, which includes three components: agent, environment, and action-feedback mechanism. This article introduces basic concepts, algorithms, and applications of reinforcement learning with focus on its fundamental principles and techniques. In particular, this article covers: 

1. What is reinforcement learning? 
2. Key terminologies and ideas behind RL. 
3. Major classes of RL problems such as prediction, control, and planning.

In summary, this article provides a comprehensive guide for those who are new to reinforcement learning, looking for a detailed understanding of the core concepts and technical details. It also helps professionals gain deeper insights into the cutting-edge topics related to reinforcement learning by providing hands-on examples and explanations.

# 2.Background introduction
## 2.1 History
Reinforcement learning was introduced by <NAME> et al.[1] in 1998 as a field of study at MIT. However, its roots go back to Pittsburgh AI Lab's influential paper on value functions[2]. Since then, RL has experienced rapid development and applications have become widespread across numerous industries including games, robotics, medical devices, finance, and others. Despite the extensive use of RL today, there remains much to be understood about its theoretical underpinnings, implementation methods, and potential benefits. 

## 2.2 Applications 
The following list highlights some popular areas where RL is currently being applied: 

1. Robotics 
2. Autonomous Vehicles 
3. Financial Services 
4. Game Playing 
5. Healthcare
6. Computer Vision
7. Recommendation Systems
8. Military Operations
9. Natural Language Processing
10. Natural Language Generation

Some of these applications require solving complex decision-making tasks within uncertain environments using efficient algorithms and computation resources. Some other applications rely primarily on predictive analytics rather than explicit decision-making mechanisms. Hence, the overlap between the two approaches could present interesting challenges for artificial intelligence systems.

# 3. Basic Concepts & Terminology 
## 3.1 Agent-Environment Interaction Loop
In RL, the agent interacts with the environment through observations (e.g., camera images), actions (e.g., driving directions), and feedback (e.g., observed rewards). The agent takes actions in response to observations received from the environment, and receives rewards from doing so. The objective of the agent is to learn a policy that maps states to actions, which maximizes expected future rewards. The agent-environment interaction loop can be summarized as follows:

1. Environment/State : Observation from the environment - typically represented as s_t. 
2. Action : Choice made by the agent - typically represented as a_t. 
3. Reward : Feedback provided by the environment to the agent - typically represented as r_t. 
4. Transition Probability Function : Mapping of state transitions, i.e., probability of reaching any given state s′_t+1 from state s_t when taking an action a_t. 
5. Policy : Mapping of states to probabilities of selecting each possible action, i.e., π(a|s), defining the agent’s behavior.
6. Value function : A measure of the long-term reward obtained by being in a certain state - typically represented as v(s).

## 3.2 Markov Decision Process (MDP)
A Markov decision process (MDP) consists of an agent acting in an environment according to a set of Markovian properties [3]. Formally, let γ ∈ [0,1], T(s' | s, a)[i] denote the probability of transitioning to state s' from state s after taking action a in state s, then we define an MDP as:


  MDP = {S, A, R, T}

   S: Set of states
   A: Set of actions 
   R: Reward function, mapping state-action pairs to rewards R(s, a) 
   T: State transition matrix, representing the probability of transitioning from one state to another via a specific action
 
Under the assumption of perfect knowledge of the environment and stochasticity in the dynamics, the optimal policy π* solves the Bellman equation:

v*(s) = max_{a∈A}(R(s, a) + γ * sum_{s'∈S}T(s'|s, a)[i]*v*(s'))

For every state s, the optimal policy π* determines the best action to take, which leads to the highest expected total return. This means that if all agents were to adopt the same policy π*, they would converge to a single optimal solution.  

## 3.3 Types of RL Problems 
RL problems fall broadly into four categories: prediction, control, planning, and imitation learning. Prediction refers to estimating the value function, whereas control involves finding policies that improve performance in the environment over time. Planning addresses the problem of optimally coordinating multiple agents to achieve common goals, while imitation learning explores creating a learned model of the world that mimics human behaviors. We will now discuss each of these types in more detail. 

### Prediction Problem
Prediction problems involve modeling the value function, which represents the utility or reward an agent expects to receive from being in different states. One approach to solve these problems is known as Dynamic Programming, which involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing solutions to them. Another approach called Monte Carlo estimation uses samples generated by interacting with the environment to estimate the value function. Other methods include temporal difference learning and neural networks. These methods enable us to estimate the value of a state without having to know the underlying MDP parameters directly. However, since the value function depends on the current state of the environment, it may not capture all aspects of the reward system.

### Control Problem
Control problems aim to find policies that lead to good results in the environment over time. Many control problems can be cast as optimization problems, specifically, finding the shortest path or trajectory that reaches the maximum reward subject to constraints. Two main classes of methods for solving control problems include value iteration and policy iteration. Both methods iteratively update the policy and value function until convergence. Value iteration computes the optimal value function in a single step, while policy iteration performs updates on both the policy and value function until convergence. The advantage of policy iteration is that it often converges faster than value iteration. 

### Planning Problem
Planning problems involve multiple agents coordinating to accomplish shared tasks. For example, suppose you need to coordinate a group of trucks moving from point A to point B, but you do not want any conflicts or disruptions. You might start by designing a plan involving just one truck, and then generalize to larger groups of trucks as needed. There are several ways to approach planning problems, including hierarchical planners, multiagent search, and POMCP. Hierarchical planners divide the task into smaller subtasks and assign subplans to individual agents. Multiagent search algorithms allow the agents to work together to explore the search space efficiently. POMCP is a probabilistic algorithm used to generate plans that account for uncertainty in the environment.

### Imitation Learning Problem
Imitation learning involves training an agent to behave like a demonstrator, similar to how animals train in the wild. The primary challenge in this problem is ensuring that the agent does not simply copy the demonstrator’s actions, as this can result in degraded performance due to biases or implicit assumptions. Common strategies for imitation learning include behavioral cloning, inverse reinforcement learning, transfer learning, and adversarial imitation learning. Behavioral cloning relies on feedforward neural networks to learn a supervised representation of the environment and learn a policy that matches the demonstrator’s behavior exactly. Inverse reinforcement learning trains a model of the demonstrator and tries to learn a policy that balances exploration and exploitation during training. Transfer learning combines expert demonstrations with lessons learned from previous tasks to create a robust model that transfers well to new domains. Adversarial imitation learning leverages generative adversarial networks (GANs) to learn a diverse set of skills, which can help prevent catastrophic forgetting.
