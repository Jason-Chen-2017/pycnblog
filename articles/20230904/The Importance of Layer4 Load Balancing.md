Layer-4 load balancers are one type of popular network devices used to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers or application instances in a cloud computing environment. In this article we will discuss what is layer-4 load balancing and why it is essential for cloud computing systems to achieve high availability and scalability. We will also explain the basic concepts behind layer-4 load balancing algorithms like round robin, weighted round robin, least connection, etc., along with their advantages and limitations. Finally, we will demonstrate how layer-4 load balancing can be implemented using popular open source software like HAProxy and F5 BIG-IP.

## 2.1 Layer-4 Load Balancing
Layer-4 load balancing is a method by which incoming traffic (layer 4) is distributed among various backend servers based on some algorithm. There are several types of Layer-4 load balancers such as:

1. IP Load Balancer(IPLB): An IPLB assigns an IP address to each server that participates in the load balancing process. This means that all requests from clients will go through the same IP address, making it easy to manage. However, this approach may not be suitable for applications that require session persistence since the client’s sessions would get lost when they are redirected to different servers. Additionally, IPLBs don't support SSL termination or other advanced features like content caching. 

2. DNS Based Load Balancing (DNS LB): A DNS LB relies on DNS (Domain Name System) lookups to direct incoming traffic to the appropriate back-end server. When a user browses a website, his computer makes a DNS request to resolve the domain name associated with the website. The DNS LB looks up the resolved IP addresses of the servers and redirects the traffic accordingly. DNS LBs offer better performance than IPLBs because they do not rely on complicated IP addressing schemes and can easily handle thousands of connections per second. However, DNS based load balancing cannot handle more complex application scenarios like session persistence, intelligent routing, or SSL offloading. 

3. Hardware Load Balancer (HW LB): A HW LB typically consists of specialized hardware appliances like load balancers, firewalls, or intrusion detection systems (IDS). These appliances work at layer 7, where HTTP headers contain information about the request, including cookies and URL parameters. By analyzing these details, HW LBs can direct traffic to specific servers based on predefined rules. HW LBs have a higher degree of control over the traffic flowing through them compared to IP or DNS based load balancers, but they still lack sophisticated features like SSL termination and content caching. 

For our purposes, we focus on layer-4 load balancers since they provide simple, efficient, and highly available solutions to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers without requiring any prior knowledge of individual servers or their configurations. They simply receive and forward the packets received by the load balancer, without modifying or examining them before forwarding them to the servers.

## 2.2 Load Balancing Algorithms
In order to balance the load between multiple servers, there needs to be a mechanism that determines how to assign incoming traffic to servers. Common load balancing algorithms include:

1. Round Robin Algorithm (RR): RR assigns equal portions of the incoming traffic to each server in a sequential manner. For example, if there are three servers, each server gets 1/3rd of the total incoming traffic. The next time a packet arrives, it goes to the next server.

2. Weighted Round Robin Algorithm (WRR): WRR assigns weights to each server, which determine its proportion of the incoming traffic. If two servers have the same weight, then both will receive half the traffic. Unlike the standard RR algorithm, WRR allows servers to take different amounts of traffic depending on their capacity. 

3. Least Connection Algorithm (LC): LC selects the server with the fewest current connections. Once a connection is established, the number of active connections is tracked for each server. The server with the lowest count receives the next incoming traffic. 

4. Destination Hashing Algorithm (DH): DH uses a hashing function to map incoming traffic to specific servers. Each incoming packet has an assigned hash value, which is used to select the destination server. This algorithm ensures even distribution of the incoming traffic while ensuring that the same server does not receive uneven loads. 

Each algorithm has certain advantages and limitations, which we'll explore later. But let's now move onto implementing these load balancing techniques using popular open source tools.
