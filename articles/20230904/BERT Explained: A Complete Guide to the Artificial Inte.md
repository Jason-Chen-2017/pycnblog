The Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is a state-of-the-art language model introduced by Google in late 2018. In this article we will briefly explore the basics of BERT and its architecture as well as some terminology that you need to know before diving deep into the details of how it works. By the end of this article, you should have a good understanding of what the key features of BERT are and how they enable the transformer-based models to capture contextual information across different parts of text data.

Together with the appendix at the end of the article, we hope this article provides an accessible overview of BERT and helps you to understand why it has become so popular among NLP practitioners and researchers worldwide. 

In summary, let’s get started!

Note: The content in this article assumes a basic familiarity with machine learning concepts such as neural networks, attention mechanisms, and word embeddings. If you are new to these topics or NLP in general, you may want to review our Beginner Tutorial on Natural Language Processing for beginners who may not be familiar with all the technical terms used here.

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before going any further, let's clarify some basic concepts and terms that we'll use throughout the article. These include:

1. **Tokenization**: Tokenization refers to breaking up text documents into individual words or sentences called tokens. This process involves splitting strings based on specific delimiters like spaces, punctuation marks, etc. For example, "Hello, world!" becomes ["Hello", ",", "world", "!"]. 

2. **Embedding**: Embedding is a technique used to represent text data in numerical form. Word embeddings are dense representations of each unique word in a vocabulary along with their semantic relationships. We can think of embedding as a way of mapping high-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional space where similar things occur closer together. Some commonly used embedding techniques include GloVe, Word2Vec, and FastText. 

3. **WordPiece**: Instead of treating each word individually during training, BERT uses a subword tokenization algorithm known as WordPiece. It splits each word into smaller units called subtokens while keeping track of the original word boundaries. This makes the task easier for the model since it considers entire phrases instead of single words. 

4. **Masked Language Modeling**: Masked language modeling is a training method used for pretraining natural language processing models. Here, we randomly mask certain positions in the input sentence and predict the masked words using the model. This helps the model learn more robust word representations by focusing on common patterns and idioms rather than just one particular sequence of characters. 

5. **Next Sentence Prediction**: Next sentence prediction is another type of pretraining task used in BERT. It aims to determine whether two consecutive sentences belong to the same document or not. This helps the model focus on long-range dependencies between sentences and improve performance on downstream tasks. 

6. **Transformer**: A transformer is a neural network architecture developed by Vaswani et al., which was proposed to overcome the limitations of recurrent neural networks. It consists of an encoder and decoder stack with multi-head attention layers in both the blocks. Transformer is capable of handling variable-length inputs and outputs and is thus suitable for natural language processing tasks.  

With these definitions out of the way, let's move forward to exploring BERT's architecture and key features. 

# 3. Architecture and Key Features
Let's now dive deeper into the inner workings of BERT. Before delving into the nitty-gritty details of how BERT works, we first need to understand the overall structure of the model. 

## Understanding the Structure 
BERT is composed of three main components: the input layer, the transformer block, and the output layer. Let's take a look at the following figure to see how these components interact with each other:


We start by encoding the input text into vectors using a pre-trained word embedding (such as GloVe). These embedded vectors then pass through the transformer block, which is made up of multiple identical layers. Each layer contains a set of self-attention operations followed by a fully connected feedforward network (FFN). The output of each FFN is fed back into the next layer as input. The final representation of the input sequence is obtained after passing through several layers of FFNs. 

In addition to the standard input and output layers, there are additional layers added specifically for pretraining purposes. These layers help us train BERT on various tasks related to language modelling. Specifically, the input layer takes in raw text data and produces encoded vectors; the masked LM layer learns to predict the masked words in a given sequence; the next sentence prediction layer determines whether two consecutive sentences belong to the same document or not; and the classification layer performs fine-tuning on top of the learned representations to perform specific tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, question answering, etc. 

By combining the powerful transformer model with several auxiliary tasks, BERT is able to achieve state-of-the-art results in many NLP tasks including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, machine translation, question answering, and more. Moreover, due to its modular nature and ability to adapt to different types of language, BERT can also be easily finetuned for specific applications without significant loss in performance. Overall, BERT offers a promising approach towards building language models that capture complex semantics and relationships between words in real-world texts.
