Technical debt is a concept that refers to the amount of extra work needed by developers to maintain or improve an existing codebase over time. It can be defined as any code that exists beyond the point where it needs to function properly and meet user requirements. Technical debt has been identified as one of the top contributors to software failures, which leads many organizations to consider reducing its impact through early measures such as paying down technical debt with modern techniques and practices such as Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD). However, addressing technical debt before it becomes too large in size can also help prevent larger issues later on during development cycles when additional resources are required to address them. This article will introduce proactive approaches to addressing technical debt early on in projects using CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and delivery, automated testing, and refactoring strategies. The aim is to provide practical examples and guidance on how to apply these approaches effectively to your own project in order to reduce technical debt and improve overall product quality.

The importance of technical debt in software development has led to numerous initiatives being proposed to address it. These include agile methodologies such as Scrum, extreme programming (XP), and Lean Software Development (LSD), and various tools and practices such as unit tests, pair programming, code reviews, code analyzers, dependency management, and others. Despite the efforts made to address technical debt, there still remains significant challenges associated with managing it efficiently, specifically at the beginning of a project's lifecycle.  

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) have become popular tools for automating the process of integrating changes from different sources into a shared repository. By regularly merging small batches of changes frequently, it is possible to detect bugs early in the development cycle and fix them more quickly, thus improving the overall quality of the final product. Additionally, automated testing frameworks allow programmers to write test cases earlier in the development cycle and catch errors prior to their deployment. Both techniques contribute significantly towards ensuring that the quality of software releases meet the expectations set forth by users, stakeholders, and customers. 

However, even after applying effective CI/CD processes, technical debt may still accumulate over time due to factors such as poor design choices, lack of thorough testing, legacy code reuse, and other disruptions caused by rapid change and new technologies. As such, it is essential to monitor and control the level of technical debt throughout the development process so that it does not grow unchecked and ultimately cause problems downstream in the system.

To further improve software quality and manage technical debt effectively, several strategies exist. One approach is to refactor and clean up the existing code to ensure that it adheres to good coding standards and best practices. Refactored code often brings improved readability, reduces complexity, and simplifies maintenance tasks. Another strategy is to use domain driven design (DDD) to create clear models of business entities and communicate them clearly to all team members. Finally, another technique is to automate some aspects of code review to identify potential risks in the code base early on, and implement techniques like peer code review, Code Smell Analysis, and code metrics tracking to keep track of code quality.

In this paper, we will discuss four proactive approaches to addressing technical debt early on in projects:

1. Automated Testing Strategy: The first step towards identifying and removing technical debt is to establish a baseline of acceptable functionality within the software. To do this, we should incorporate automated testing into our development process. An automated testing framework allows us to write test cases ahead of time, providing confidence that newly written code meets the desired functional specifications and doesn't accidentally break something else. We can use various types of testing, including Unit Tests, Integration Tests, System Tests, User Acceptance Tests, Performance Tests, etc., depending on the nature of the project. 

2. Continuous Refactoring Strategy: Once we have established a baseline of tested and working code, we need to continue to refine and improve it. Over time, the code may become outdated and unmaintainable, leading to technical debt. A continuous refactoring strategy involves rewriting code without changing external behavior and preserving the same interface. This ensures that any future modifications to the code only require minimal effort to adapt to new requirements or technology stack updates. 

3. Peer Code Review Strategy: Peer code review is becoming increasingly common in software development circles. Although it can seem like unnecessary busywork, peer code review provides valuable feedback on code quality, best practices, and style guides. Conducting regular peer reviews promotes knowledge sharing among team members, encourages collaboration, and helps to identify areas for improvement. 

4. Code Metrics Tracking Strategy: Since technical debt accumulates over time and requires ongoing attention, monitoring code quality and measuring key metrics like lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, and maintainability index can help identify areas for improvement and inform planning for future improvements. For example, if the number of high priority defects is increasing, it could indicate that the existing code is not meeting customer needs. Similarly, if the code coverage drops below certain thresholds, it could indicate that there is low test automation or insufficient testing. Overall, this type of analysis can help identify critical areas of concern and guide the decision making process for prioritizing upcoming sprints.
