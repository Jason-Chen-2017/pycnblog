Urban traffic networks are essential components of urban systems where various transportation modes congest the roads. Congestion can lead to disruption of services such as travel times or vehicles flow through the network which can have negative impacts on both economic and social aspects. Therefore, accurate analysis of urban traffic is critical for managing this crucial resource efficiently. In order to achieve spatial-temporal level understanding of urban traffic patterns and detect abnormal events, researchers have proposed several machine learning based techniques such as pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and deep learning algorithms. This article aims at providing an overview of current state-of-the-art approaches for analyzing urban traffic and detecting abnormal behavioral patterns with specific focus on applying deep learning algorithms to analyze and predict spatio-temporal patterns in urban traffic data. Moreover, we will discuss open issues and future directions related to this topic. Finally, we present a brief summary of related literature that may provide further insights into this topic.

- Spatio-temporal network: A set of nodes (junctions) and directed links connecting them representing different geographical locations over time. Each link has associated features such as length, speed limit, etc., denoted by attributes.
- Trajectory: The movement of objects or agents across space and time is represented by trajectories. A trajectory is a sequence of positions and orientations along the road network. It consists of multiple records or snapshots taken over a period of time. These records can be aggregated into trajectories based on certain criteria such as duration or number of points. We refer to these records as states or measurements. For example, a single measurement from GPS device during one second represents a state whereas aggregating all these measurements over a minute interval results in a trajectory. In general, the term “trajectory” refers to any motion observed over a time period. 

- Feature extraction: Methods used for extracting relevant features from raw data collected from sensors located at junctions, intersections, or highway lanes. Features could include local geometry features such as distance between two consecutive road segments, curvature of the road, angle formed by the road segment with respect to north direction, etc.; temporal features such as speed limit, vehicle density, pedestrian flow, etc.; and contextual features such as weather conditions, historical traffic conditions, land use types, etc. Different feature engineering methods are being developed for each type of sensor data. Some common feature extraction techniques are dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA), support vector machines (SVM), clustering, and neural networks (NN).

- Sequence modeling: A technique to capture dynamic properties of spatio-temporal data, enabling prediction of future values. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a popular choice for sequence modeling tasks due to its ability to process sequential data. RNN models take input sequences of variable lengths and produce output sequences of similar lengths. Several variants of RNN architectures like LSTM, GRU, and Transformers are also being explored for this purpose.

- Time series analysis: Techniques used for studying the behavior of variables that change in time. Univariate time series analysis involves studying the behavior of individual variables such as temperature, humidity, etc., while multivariate time series analysis involves studying relationships among multiple variables. Classical statistical methods like linear regression, autoregressive moving average (ARMA), and stochastic differential equation (SDE) are widely used for univariate time series analysis. Multivariate analysis uses complex autoregressive models such as VAR, GARCH, and Bayesian nonparametric inference. Other methods for analyzing time series include kernel smoothing, wavelet transform, and SSA (state space approach).

- Anomaly detection: Machine learning method used for identifying abnormal patterns or behaviors that do not conform to expected or normal trends. One class of anomaly detection methods is point outliers, which identify observations that deviate significantly from other observations in a dataset. Outlier identification can help identify areas of concern within datasets and highlight potential problems. Another class of anomaly detection methods is model-based, which builds a probabilistic model of the underlying process generating the data and then identifies regions of low probability. The most commonly used algorithm for anomaly detection in urban traffic is isolation forest, which combines random forests and decision trees to reduce false positives and improve performance.

- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning: Process of selecting appropriate machine learning models for a given task and optimizing their parameters to obtain best performing solution. Grid search, randomized search, and Bayesian optimization methods are commonly used for model selection. Hyperparameters represent adjustable parameters that affect the accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and other metrics of the final model. Tuning hyperparameters requires careful attention to avoid overfitting and underfitting errors.

- Data preprocessing: Preprocessing steps required before feeding the extracted features into machine learning algorithms. Steps involved include normalization, standardization, missing value imputation, scaling, feature selection, and data augmentation.

- Evaluation metric: A quantitative measure of how well the predicted outcome matches the actual outcomes. Common evaluation metrics for urban traffic analysis are mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R^2), area under curve (AUC), and confusion matrix.

- Dataset: Collection of spatio-temporal data obtained from various sources including surveys, satellite imagery, radar, and crowdsourced data. There are many publicly available datasets available for research purposes. Some prominent ones are Caltrans PeMS, Toronto Transportation Zone Survey (TTZ), Montreal Bike Share, and Google Traffic Sensor Data Set. Each dataset typically contains millions of samples with varying dimensions depending on the complexity of the system.

## Introduction and Problem Definition
In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies have led to breakthroughs in fields such as natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, robotics, and reinforcement learning. However, applications of deep learning to urban traffic analysis have been limited until recently. Researchers have proposed numerous machine learning-based techniques for analyzing urban traffic data, but they still need to integrate diverse sources of information, develop new algorithms, and apply advanced data preprocessing techniques to effectively utilize existing data resources. Specifically, the primary challenge lies in obtaining valuable and comprehensive spatio-temporal traffic data in real-time. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning approach to analyze and predict spatio-temporal traffic patterns. Our goal is to leverage the latest advances in deep learning to accurately characterize and forecast spatial-temporal patterns in urban traffic networks. 

The problem definition can be summarized as follows:

1. Collect large-scale spatio-temporal traffic data: As mentioned earlier, there exists no effective way to collect spatio-temporal traffic data without significant computational and financial costs. However, efforts towards collecting massive amounts of spatio-temporal traffic data have already started and continue to expand. Currently, more than three billion GPS and cellular phone location records have been generated every year globally, making it difficult to manually review and filter all these records. Thus, we need to adopt automated data collection strategies that continuously monitor mobile devices and update database regularly. 

2. Integrate diverse sources of information: Urban traffic networks consist of multiple actors interacting with each other, resulting in heterogeneous data sources ranging from GPS traces, cellular triangulation, image data, audio recordings, and text reports. Accurate integration of these data sources is essential for creating robust and informative predictions. 

3. Develop new algorithms: Traditional machine learning algorithms often rely heavily on handcrafted features or rules designed specifically for the given problem domain. While these techniques work well in some cases, they fail miserably when applied to highly nonlinear domains such as urban traffic analysis. A key objective of our project is to explore the merits of deep learning algorithms for analyzing urban traffic data. 

4. Apply advanced data preprocessing techniques: With vast amount of raw data collected from various sources, manual inspection and filtering of data remains expensive and challenging. Automated data cleaning procedures can potentially save significant time and effort. However, efficient application of advanced data preprocessing techniques such as dimensionality reduction using PCA, clustering, or SOM, should enhance the overall performance of deep learning algorithms. Additionally, we need to ensure that our algorithms are able to handle sparse, noisy, and incomplete data appropriately. 

To summarize, our goal is to design and implement a deep learning-based framework capable of analyzing and predicting spatio-temporal traffic patterns in urban traffic networks. In this article, we will first describe the core concepts and terminologies used in urban traffic analysis. Then, we will introduce the major research challenges and opportunities faced by researchers who want to build practical solutions to this problem. Next, we will provide details about the technical architecture of our proposed framework and highlight key contributions. Finally, we will conclude with future directions and open issues.
