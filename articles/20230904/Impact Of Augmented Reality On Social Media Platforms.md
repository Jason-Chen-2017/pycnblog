# 1.简介
  

Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that allows users to see and interact with virtual objects in the real world by overlaying these objects on top of their physical environment. AR applications have been used extensively for entertainment purposes such as playing games or watching movies, but recently it has become increasingly popular on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc., where users can share creative content and engage in conversations through video conferencing tools, live streaming features etc. This article will give an overview of how augmented reality is being used on social media platforms and what benefits it brings to users. 

# 2. Basic Concepts And Terminology
- Virtual Object: A digital representation of an actual object which appears in the user’s view. These virtual objects are created using computer graphics software and then projected onto the real world. Examples include cartoon characters, animated images, plants and animals.
- Marker: An image that is placed on a surface within the real world to indicate the location of a virtual object. Markers help the device identify where different objects should be overlaid in order to create a seamless experience for the user.
- Augmented Reality Device: Any device that incorporates technologies like camera, microphone, GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, and touchscreen to enable users to interact with virtual objects in the real world. For example, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Samsung Gear VR etc.

# 3. Core Algorithm And Operations
The core algorithm behind augmented reality involves the following steps:

1. Creation of the virtual object – The creation process starts from selecting an appropriate virtual object that suits the context of the situation and rendering its model into an image format. Once rendered, this image can be saved to the user's device memory. 

2. Detection of markers – Once the virtual object has been created, the next step involves identifying markers on the physical surroundings of the user. The detection process uses machine learning algorithms to recognize patterns present in the marker image and match them against predefined templates stored on the device. After matching, the corresponding virtual object will appear at the identified position.

3. User interaction – To allow users to interact with the virtual object, various input devices like controllers, keyboards and mouse movements can be added to the device hardware. Once detected, these inputs are translated into commands that can be passed on to the virtual object to modify its properties or behavior accordingly.

4. Synchronization between multiple devices – In addition to allowing users to interact with their own device, augmented reality also offers multiplayer gaming experiences through synchronization across multiple devices connected to the same network. This enables users to join game sessions from any device and play together in real time, all while experiencing the immersive effects of the virtual objects.

# 4. Code Implementation And Explanation
Sample code implementation for displaying a virtual character on screen using Unity3D engine would look something like this:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class DisplayVirtualCharacter : MonoBehaviour {

    // Reference to the CharacterModel
    public GameObject characterPrefab;
    
    // Reference to the Camera component
    private Camera arCamera;

    void Start() {
        // Create instance of the Camera component
        if(GameObject.FindObjectOfType<Camera>()) {
            arCamera = GameObject.FindObjectOfType<Camera>();
        } else {
            Debug.LogError("Could not find main camera.");
        }
        
        // Instantiate the CharacterModel prefab
        Vector3 spawnPosition = new Vector3(0f, 0f, -10f);
        Quaternion spawnRotation = Quaternion.identity;

        GameObject characterInstance = 
            (GameObject)Instantiate(characterPrefab, spawnPosition, spawnRotation);
            
        // Set the camera to render only the background color so that 
        // we don't see anything other than the character
        Color backgroundColor = RenderSettings.ambientSkyColor;
        RenderSettings.ambientMode = UnityEngine.Rendering.AmbientMode.Trilight;
        RenderSettings.ambientLight = backgroundColor;
        arCamera.clearFlags = CameraClearFlags.SolidColor;
        arCamera.backgroundColor = backgroundColor;
    }

    void Update() {
        // Get the current orientation of the phone/tablet with respect to 
        // the direction vector pointing towards the center of the screen
        float xRot = Input.acceleration.x * Mathf.Rad2Deg;
        transform.rotation = Quaternion.Euler(-xRot / 2, 0f, 0f);
        
        // Move the character along the z axis based on joystick movement
        float zPos = Input.GetAxis("Vertical") * Time.deltaTime * 10f;
        characterInstance.transform.Translate(0f, 0f, zPos);
    }
}
```

In this sample code, we first get references to the necessary components like the `CharacterModel` and `Camera`. Then, in the `Start()` method, we instantiate the `CharacterModel` prefab and set up the camera parameters to ensure that we only see the character without any additional visual elements around us. 

Next, in the `Update()` method, we check for user input such as acceleration data received via the accelerometer sensor and move the character along the z axis based on the vertical displacement provided by the joystick. We use a small time delay factor (`Time.deltaTime`) to make sure that the movement is smooth and not too sudden. Finally, we apply some rotations to the character depending on its pitch angle relative to the screen orientation.
