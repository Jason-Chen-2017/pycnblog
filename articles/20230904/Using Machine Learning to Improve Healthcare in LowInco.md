Healthcare plays a crucial role in supporting societies and individuals through providing access to health care services such as medicines, dental care, and hospitalization facilities for living conditions ranging from chronic diseases and injuries to prevention of disease and treatment options for infant mortality. Despite the availability of affordable medical insurance plans that cover routine treatments and preventive measures for a wide range of medical conditions including heart failure and diabetes, most low-income countries still struggle with access to healthcare services due to lack of infrastructure development or awareness among their population. In this regard, machine learning (ML) has emerged as an invaluable tool for developing personalized healthcare solutions by leveraging vast amounts of data available on patients' demographics, lifestyle habits, and medical histories. 

In recent years, various ML models have been developed using publicly available datasets which are used to develop predictive models for different healthcare problems like diabetes management, cardiovascular disease detection, respiratory illnesses prediction, etc. However, these models have limitations associated with accuracy and speed performance. As the size of the dataset increases, so does the computational power required for training the model, making it difficult to scale up for practical deployment across large populations. To address these challenges, several organizations are working towards improving the accessibility and usability of healthcare solutions by integrating robust AI algorithms into digital platforms and apps for low-income communities. 

This article provides a comprehensive guideline for applying machine learning techniques to improve healthcare in low-income countries by presenting basic concepts, terminologies, core algorithmic principles, and practical operations. This article also includes detailed code examples alongside explanations, enabling readers to implement real-world scenarios with ease. Moreover, future directions and challenges related to this research topic can be discussed, highlighting the importance of reaching out to stakeholders, mobilizing resources, and adopting best practices to ensure successful outcomes. The final chapter concludes with common questions and answers for better understanding. Overall, this is a technical blog article intended for those who want to gain insights into how modern technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning can help support low-income communities. It will provide a helpful reference for policy makers, healthcare professionals, and technology enthusiasts looking to apply advancement in healthcare for underserved communities around the world.

# 2. Basic Concepts
## 2.1 Types of Machine Learning 
The term "machine learning" refers to the use of statistical methods to train computer programs to recognize patterns within data without being explicitly programmed. There are three main types of machine learning systems based on their goals:

1. Supervised Learning - In supervised learning, the goal is to learn a function that maps inputs to outputs based on labeled training data. For example, given a set of images of handwritten digits, the task would be to train a classifier that could correctly identify each digit based on its features extracted from the image. 

2. Unsupervised Learning - In unsupervised learning, there is no output variable associated with the input variables, only input data points are considered. The purpose is to find hidden structure within the data based on clustering similar data points together. Cluster analysis is widely applied in data mining, pattern recognition, and image processing. Examples include clustering customers based on purchase behavior, identifying natural groups in social networks, and finding topics in text documents. 

3. Reinforcement Learning - In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions in response to rewards or punishments provided by the environment. It interacts with the environment and receives feedback about its actions, then adjusts its strategy accordingly to maximize long-term reward. An example application of reinforcement learning is playing video games where the agent must balance between staying alive while collecting the highest score possible.
