Bike sharing systems are becoming increasingly popular in cities across the world. The demand for bike rentals is constantly rising and it is estimated that bikes will take over from cars by 2050 [1]. Therefore, with these advantages of using a bike share system, we can provide an excellent service for our customers while providing economical yet comfortable transportation options. However, predicting future bike rental demands remains challenging due to various factors such as seasonality, weather conditions, holidays, etc., which makes accurate forecasting even more crucial. In this paper, we propose a new approach called “time series modeling” (TSM) based on time-series properties. We use statistical methods such as regression analysis, smoothing techniques, and ARMA models to capture temporal patterns in historical bike rental data and improve their accuracy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of TSM, we used a case study involving bike sharing demand data from the city of San Francisco. Our results show that incorporating time-series features into machine learning algorithms significantly improves the forecasting performance compared to simple linear regression or moving average approaches. Specifically, the improved forecasting performance was up to 79% in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE). This shows that TSM is indeed capable of capturing important temporal patterns and improving the overall accuracy of bike sharing demand predictions.

## 2.1 Bike sharing demand
In order to understand what bike sharing actually entails, let us consider the simplest form of bike sharing where customers simply borrow a bike at one end of the street and return it at the other end when they finish using it. When there is sufficient demand for bikes, the number of available bikes is usually increased, allowing more people to borrow them. Each person who borrows a bike uses it for a fixed duration of time before returning it to the same location again. 

A key challenge faced by bike share companies is how to efficiently allocate bikes amongst riders, especially during peak hours where there may be a large volume of travel. One way to do this is through dynamic pricing strategies where the price varies depending on the amount of demand at any given time. Alternatively, bike sharing companies also offer reservations that allow customers to make a reservation ahead of time so that the bikes they choose can already be located nearby. These reservations can be made online and can help maximize utilization and efficiency of the resources. 

To better understand the demand for bike sharing, we need to first understand the different types of demand and market segments involved. There are two main categories of demand for bike sharing services: personal demand and aggregated demand. Personal demand refers to individual users wanting to borrow a bike for short periods of time, typically less than three hours each. Aggregated demand refers to businesses offering their employees or guests a shared bike infrastructure, which includes facilities like dockless mobility and community bike programs. Another category of demand involves long term contracts between consumers and operators that involve longer trips or longer-term reservations. All of these demand types require different management strategies to ensure efficient allocation of resources.

In addition to demand from individuals and businesses, bike sharing has emerged as a significant industry-wide phenomenon that affects both local communities and national markets. In January 2021, bike share providers have been tracking over 40 million trips annually, representing approximately half of all commutes in the United States. Of those trips, about 70 percent occur on public roads within metropolitan areas and in some instances within small towns. While many bike share companies aim to meet the needs of all riders, many others focus on serving urbanites with shorter commute times and offer affordable rates that meet basic needs. Despite this, bike sharing continues to grow exponentially, with new providers establishing new locations and providing more flexible payment plans.


## 2.2 Time series modeling
Time series data represents a sequence of observations taken at regular intervals, such as daily stock prices or hourly temperature readings. Traditional statistical methods, such as ordinary least squares (OLS), assume that the observed data follows a random walk process or autoregressive model. Nonetheless, real-world time series often exhibit non-stationarity and have complex seasonal patterns. Thus, we need alternative methods that account for these variations.

One common approach is to use exponential smoothing techniques, which give greater weight to recent data points and decrease the weights assigned to past values gradually over time. Popular examples include Holt's Linear Trend method and Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES). These methods estimate level, trend, and seasonal components of the time series separately and then combine them to produce a single forecasted value. Other methods, such as Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), explicitly model these components and can handle non-stationary time series more effectively.

In this work, we employ several state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting Machines, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to build predictive models for bike sharing demand. In particular, we apply SARIMAX models, a class of ARIMA models that accounts for seasonality effects, to the bike sharing demand dataset to capture its temporal characteristics. Additionally, we perform feature engineering to extract useful time-series features, including day of week, month, hour of day, and temperature. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our models using multiple evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Coefficient of Determination (R^2).

Predicting future bike sharing demand relies on understanding the seasonality, cyclical behavior, and irregular patterns in the underlying time series data. Although numerous research papers have explored these topics, few attempts have been made to leverage time-series properties to enhance forecasting accuracy. In this work, we present a novel approach, termed Time Series Modeling (TSM), that combines established machine learning techniques with advanced time-series modeling techniques to address these challenges. TSM consists of four core steps:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis: In this step, we analyze the bike sharing demand dataset to identify relevant features and unusual behaviors. We visualize the time-series data and check for outliers, missing data, and trend changes.
2. Feature Engineering: In this step, we transform the raw time-series data into a format suitable for training machine learning models. We extract temporal features such as day of week, month, hour of day, and temperature and merge them with external variables such as weather data and holiday information.
3. Time-Series Modeling: In this step, we train multiple models, including regression models, gradient boosting machines, and deep neural networks, to capture the underlying patterns in the time-series data. We select the best performing model based on the RMSE metric.
4. Evaluation: Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of our final model using standardized evaluation metrics, including MAE, RMSE, and R^2. We compare the performance of our models against traditional baseline models, namely linear regression and moving averages.

By combining advanced time-series modeling techniques with cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, we achieve significant improvements in forecasting accuracy. For example, we obtain an improvement of up to 79% in terms of RMSE, which demonstrates that incorporating time-series features into machine learning algorithms is feasible and effective. Overall, this work provides a clear framework for leveraging time-series properties to improve forecasting accuracy and highlights the importance of considering these aspects in designing robust time-series forecasting systems.
