游戏开发者面临着一个重要但又复杂的问题——如何实现游戏逻辑？作为新手程序员或初级程序员，如何从头开始学习游戏编程？本教程将向你展示如何通过游戏语法、语义、数据结构和算法等知识点进行游戏逻辑的实现，并带领你理解游戏世界的运作方式。
在游戏开发中，语法和语义是最重要的两个概念。它指出了指令与对象之间的关系、指令的顺序、指令的参数和返回值。为了更好地了解这些概念，本教程将带领你逐步了解这些概念的定义和应用。同时还会给出一些游戏开发实践中常用的计算机语言、数据结构和算法，帮助你在游戏开发过程中更好地处理问题。最后，本教程也会回顾一下游戏开发中经常出现的问题及解决方案，并且提供一些游戏开发中的资源供你参考。
本教程的内容包含以下部分：
# Part I: Introduction to Programming in Games 
Introduction: What is a game? How do games work? Why should we program them? Who should read this tutorial?
What are the common programming languages used in games? Where can you find resources for learning these languages?
Data Structures: Arrays, lists, dictionaries, stacks, queues, etc., what they are used for, how to use them correctly, and their time complexity.
Algorithms: Common algorithms such as sorting, searching, graph traversal, recursion, backtracking, and dynamic programming. How to implement each algorithm using the appropriate data structure(s).
Syntax and Semantics: The syntax of a programming language determines its operations; it's important to understand the basics of the syntax so that you can write correct code. The semantics defines how the language works and what happens when you run your code. Understanding both the syntax and semantics will help you make better decisions about how to approach problems in the future.


# Part II: Learning by Example
Game Logic: In this section, we'll explore some example games written in popular computer graphics engines like Unity or Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) to demonstrate how game logic is implemented in real-world applications. We'll go through examples of how to handle player input, character movement, collision detection, camera controls, particle effects, level design, and more. By doing so, you'll learn how to apply the concepts discussed earlier in the course. Here are the topics covered in this section:
Handling Player Input
Character Movement
Collision Detection
Camera Controls
Particle Effects
Level Design


Game AI: This section provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques used in games, including decision trees, pathfinding, behavior trees, and neural networks. You'll also get hands-on experience with implementing various AI algorithms in UE4 using blueprints.
Artificial Intelligence Techniques Used in Games
Decision Trees
Pathfinding
Behavior Trees
Neural Networks


Rendering Pipeline: Rendering refers to the process of converting 3D models into pixels on the screen. A rendering pipeline consists of several stages that transform raw 3D scenes into rendered images. In this part, we'll review different rendering techniques used in games such as deferred shading, forward rendering, and voxel rendering. By understanding these techniques, you'll be able to optimize the performance of your game and improve visual quality. Here are the topics covered in this section:
Deferred Shading
Forward Rendering
Voxel Rendering


Sound & Music: Game sound design involves creating audio content that delivers immersive experiences to players. We'll cover fundamental principles of sound synthesis, positional audio, dynamic music generation, and other relevant aspects of game sound design. You'll also learn how to integrate sound effects, ambience, and background music into your UE4 projects. Here are the topics covered in this section:
Fundamentals of Sound Synthesis
Positional Audio
Dynamic Music Generation
Integration with UE4 Projects


Networking: Networking allows multiplayer games to span multiple devices over a network connection. It helps provide smooth gameplay and communication between users. We'll cover networking fundamentals, client-server architecture, peer-to-peer architectures, and the role of middleware servers in delivering reliable and secure communications across networks. You'll also learn how to implement server and client functionality in UE4 using C++ and blueprints. Here are the topics covered in this section:
Networking Fundamentals
Client-Server Architecture
Peer-To-Peer Architecture
Middleware Servers


Debugging: Debugging is the act of identifying and fixing errors or bugs in software programs. As a programmer, debugging is essential if you want to create high-quality products. But even the best developers sometimes make mistakes when writing code. In this section, we'll discuss common debugging tools, methods, and strategies used in game development. You'll also get hands-on experience troubleshooting issues in UE4 using the debugger and log messages. Here are the topics covered in this section:
Common Debugging Tools and Strategies
Debugging Techniques
Log Messages in UE4
