> “vneter”的由来?
> Vneter is a cloud-native networking framework developed by our CTO Jeffrey Duan (@Jeffrey_Duan). Vneter enables companies to rapidly build and manage modern microservice-based network architectures that are scalable, secure, and fault tolerant. It allows enterprises to easily create virtual networks with microservices running on various platforms such as Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or Amazon ECS, while still providing the flexibility of connecting services across multiple clouds and data centers. In addition, Vneter provides a highly flexible and extensible design, allowing developers to customize their own service routing policies and load balancing algorithms for maximum application performance. Last but not least, Vneter offers enterprise-grade security features like mutual TLS authentication, role based access control (RBAC), fine grained authorization policy enforcement, and intrusion detection/prevention tools, all built into its core architecture.
> “What's new in vneter compared to other solutions?”
> The main differences between Vneter and other networking solutions are:

1. Cloud Native: Vneter is designed from scratch with cloud native principles in mind. We use industry-leading technologies like containers and microservices, which offer improved scalability, reliability, and resilience. This makes it easy for organizations to scale their applications horizontally, even across multiple regions or clouds.

2. Service Mesh Integration: Our technology stack includes support for both traditional monolithic architectures and microservices-based architectures. Vneter also integrates seamlessly with service mesh technologies like Istio and Consul Connect, making it easier than ever to connect microservices across different clusters, clouds, and data centers.

3. Policy-Based Routing and Load Balancing: With policy-based routing and load balancing capabilities, developers can define complex routing rules and load balancing strategies using predefined templates or custom ones. These features allow organizations to ensure optimal service availability at any time, no matter where they run their applications.

4. Security Features: Vneter comes equipped with several advanced security features like mutual TLS authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), fine-grained authorization policy enforcement, and intrusion detection/prevention systems. These features enable organizations to protect sensitive information, maintain compliance with regulations, and prevent unauthorized access.

In summary, Vneter is the fastest way to build and manage robust, secure microservice-based networks across multi-cloud environments. Its unique approach to networking brings together containerization, service meshes, and policy-driven networking to provide organizations with powerful and flexible ways to build and manage networks quickly and efficiently. Additionally, we believe that Vneter will continue to evolve over time to meet the needs of today’s and future enterprises. 

This article aims to give an overview of Vneter and discuss some key points regarding its benefits, integration with popular service mesh technologies, and how it addresses common challenges such as service discovery, load balancing, and deployment management. We hope you find this article useful! Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

## 什么是VNeter？ 
VNeter是一个基于云原生的微服务网络框架，由CTO赵俊杰(@Jeffrey_Duan)于2021年发布。VNeter使得企业能够快速构建和管理现代微服务架构的网络，网络架构具有弹性、安全、容错能力，能够让公司实现现代化的微服务架构。它允许企业轻松地在众多容器平台如Kubernetes、Docker Swarm或Amazon ECS上运行各种微服务，同时仍然提供连接多个云数据中心的灵活性。除此之外，VNeter还提供了高度灵活且可扩展的设计，开发者可以自由地定制自己的服务路由策略和负载均衡算法，以最大化应用性能。最后但并非最不重要的一点，VNeter还提供了企业级安全功能，包括双向TLS认证、基于角色的访问控制(RBAC)、细粒度授权策略强制执行、入侵检测/防范工具等。总而言之，VNeter是构建、管理健壮、安全的微服务网络的最快方式！
## VNeter 和其他网络方案有何不同？
**1.云原生架构：**VNeter 是从头开始设计的，采用了云原生架构。该框架使用微服务技术、容器和编排技术，可以让企业轻松地水平扩展应用。这极大地提高了企业的易用性。 

**2.Service Mesh集成：**VNeter 集成了Istio和Consul Connect，用户可以轻松地连接集群、云、数据中心上的微服务。这是因为这些服务网格技术能够将微服务间的通信自动化，降低了复杂性。 

**3.基于策略的路由与负载均衡：**VNeter 提供基于策略的路由与负载均衡的功能，开发者可以使用预定义的模板或自定义的策略对应用进行流量管理。这是为了确保应用程序在任何情况下都能保持正常的可用性。 

**4.安全功能：**VNeter 提供了诸如双向TLS认证、基于角色的访问控制(RBAC)、细粒度授权策略强制执行、入侵检测/防范系统等安全功能。这些功能使企业能够保护敏感信息、遵守法律要求、阻止未经授权的访问。 

综合来看，VNeter 是构建、管理现代化的微服务网络的最佳选择。无论是在混合云环境中部署微服务还是在单个云环境中部署微服务，VNeter 都提供了一致的解决方案。
