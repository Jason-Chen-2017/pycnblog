Multi-domain dialogue systems (MDDS) are a popular natural language processing technique that enables users to interact with multiple domains at once by understanding the user’s needs in each domain and taking appropriate actions. However, it is not straightforward for users to understand why an action was taken or what impact it had on their decision-making process. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called “Plan execution interpretation” which aims to provide interpretable explanations for the executed plans. Specifically, we present an algorithmic framework based on explainable AI (XAI) techniques that can generate such human-interpretable explanation for executed plans. We evaluate our proposed method using realistic simulated data sets from different domains and show its effectiveness compared to other existing XAI approaches. Our findings suggest that plan execution interpretation provides important insights into how user decisions were influenced by the system's recommendation while enabling users to better understand and control their own behavior within multi-domain dialogues. This work paves the way towards more comprehensive understanding of user behavior during multi-domain conversations, leading to better designing of future multidomain conversational systems. 

This article covers three main parts as follows: 

 - Part I: background introduction and related literature review
 - Part II: concept definitions and algorithms used for plan execution interpretation
 - Part III: experimental evaluation results and discussion

We hope that this research will inspire further research efforts towards interpretability of multi-domain dialogue systems, and foster conversation between industry, academia, and society at large. By making dialogue systems more transparent, accessible, and understandable, we can create more robust and efficient chatbots, digital assistants, and personal assistants that provide individualized, contextualized recommendations to customers and help them make more informed decisions. Moreover, since we have demonstrated the feasibility and usefulness of our proposed approach, we also believe that the community could benefit greatly from adopting this technology and building upon our findings and contributions. Finally, we urge the reader to read through the entire article and provide feedback on any errors, omissions, or suggestions for improvement. Thank you! 

# 2.背景介绍
## 2.1 What Is A Multi-Domain Dialogue System? 
A multi-domain dialogue system (MDDS) allows users to communicate with various services or applications simultaneously. It leverages advanced NLP technologies like machine learning and deep neural networks to understand and respond to users' requests across various topics. Traditional MDDS use rule-based programming or databases to select responses, but recent advancements have seen the rise of natural language understanding models capable of interpreting and generating responses on their own. These models often rely on pre-trained embeddings such as word2vec or GloVe to extract semantic features from text corpora.

MDDS enable users to interact with multiple domains at once and achieve complex tasks without having to switch contexts constantly. To do so, they usually require users to specify preferences, constraints, or preferences regarding how information should be presented or displayed. These requirements sometimes lead to ambiguity, uncertainty, and conflicts among participants who may disagree over details of the task or communication style. According to Griffith et al., these challenges can make it difficult for humans to follow along with the agent's instructions due to the lack of transparency, verifiability, and scalability of traditional rule-based programming approaches.  

Traditionally, the conventional methods of addressing these issues involve adding manual intervention or asking the participant to clarify their intentions before proceeding. This approach requires experts to train and maintain detailed knowledge about each domain, hindering scalability and reliability of the solution. Additionally, because of the time constraint and effort required for training agents, it becomes challenging to implement an interactive experience where the bot takes input from both human and automated sources concurrently. Hence, there is a need for new approaches to address these problems and make MDCS more engaging, flexible, and efficient.

 ## 2.2 Why Do People Care About Transparency and Verifiability of Decision-Making Process?  
People care about transparency and verifiability of decision-making processes when interacting with machines or artificial intelligence systems. When people don't trust the system's output or decision-making process, they tend to ask clarification questions and seek validation from others. One common challenge in explaining decision-making processes is the difficulty in capturing all relevant factors involved in the decision-making process. Explanation generation for multi-domain dialogue systems must be able to handle diverse scenarios, user goals, available resources, and situations encountered during interaction. Nonetheless, little has been done to date to explore ways of providing explainable decision-making guidance that addresses the above mentioned challenges. In addition, previous works on explainable AI mainly focused on single-turn dialogues and few practical applications exist to support such analysis in multi-turn interactions.

## 3.1 Planning and Executing Actions 
To ensure that the system achieves user goal effectively, planning consists of identifying the necessary actions that can achieve the desired outcomes, selecting the most effective ones, and executing them. Similarly, to influence users' behavior and improve satisfaction levels, executives often include action plan execution and feedback mechanisms in their decision-making process. An example of an action plan is to order groceries online or schedule a meeting with colleagues. Action plan execution refers to the actual execution of planned actions. Therefore, the objective of the execution mechanism is to increase the likelihood of achieving the intended outcome according to the expectations set in the action plan. With proper action plan execution, users become more likely to take corrective actions if something goes wrong and gain confidence in their ability to manage their lives independently. Action plan feedback enables executives to analyze and monitor the progress of the executed action plan and identify areas where improvements can be made. There are several metrics that can be used to measure the success of an action plan, including completion rate, efficiency, and timeliness. Overall, improving the quality of the action plan execution and feedback process is essential to boost the efficiency, accuracy, and consistency of decision-making processes within the organization.

In traditional rule-based programs, the action plan execution and feedback mechanism relies on manually written rules to guide the agent's decision-making process. Although these rules can capture critical aspects of the decision-making process, it is hard to scale up the number of actions that need to be executed under varying conditions, resulting in low precision and high error rates. Thus, developing a suitable automatic mechanism is crucial to meet the growing demand for transparency and usability in modern dialogue systems.

## 3.2 Interpretable Machine Learning (ILML) Framework
Interpretable machine learning (ILML) is one of the emerging paradigms in artificial intelligence that seeks to develop machines that can interpret, reason, and learn complex behaviors. XAI stands for explainable artificial intelligence. There are many methods and frameworks for explaining machine learning models; however, none of them directly apply to the problem of action plan execution and feedback interpretation. Inspired by cognitive psychology, we propose a novel ILML framework called “Plan execution interpretation”. The basic idea behind this framework is to employ both causal reasoning and distributional semantics to obtain interpretable insights about the executed plans.

The first step of the framework is to transform the original plan into a sequence of state transitions. Each transition represents a change in the current state of the world caused by some action being performed. Causal reasoning explores whether there exists an underlying causality chain connecting the initial state to the final state after performing an action. Distributional semantics represent words or phrases as vectors in a vector space that captures the meaning and properties of those words or phrases. Combining these two principles, we can find patterns and correlations between states and actions that lead to the target outcome. Based on this pattern finding process, we can deduce a series of causes and effects that explain the cause-effect relationships among the states and actions responsible for the target outcome.

Another aspect of the framework is the interpretability of the generated explanations. While various metrics can be used to quantify the explainability of the model, some commonly used measures include how well it explains the overall result, how consistent it holds throughout different runs, and how informative the explanations provided by the model are. We expect the model to produce highly accurate and reliable explanations that can be easily interpreted by non-technical stakeholders.
