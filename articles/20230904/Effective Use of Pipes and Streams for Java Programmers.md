# 1.简介
  

Pipes (or streams) are a fundamental concept in the java.io package that allows two threads to exchange data. They were introduced as part of JDK 1.4 along with a new collection called "java.util.stream" that simplifies processing collections of objects using functional programming techniques. In this article we will discuss how to use pipes and streams effectively in your Java programs. We will start by reviewing basic concepts such as thread safety and blocking, before moving on to explore the different types of streams available in Java and their characteristics. Finally, we will demonstrate various examples of using pipes and streams to solve common problems in Java applications, including reading from files, filtering data, transforming data, sorting, grouping, joining, merging, and aggregating data sets. By the end of this article you should have an understanding of the key features and benefits of pipes and streams and be able to apply them to your own projects successfully.

Before diving into effective use of pipes and streams, it is important to understand the basics of thread-safety and blocking in Java.
## 2.1 Thread Safety
In multithreaded environments, programmers need to take steps to ensure that multiple threads do not interfere with each other's access to shared resources or data structures. This can lead to race conditions where one thread overwrites changes made by another, which could result in incorrect behavior or even application crashes. To prevent this, all classes in Java must be designed in such a way that they can safely operate concurrently without causing conflicts. One approach to achieve thread safety is to make every class immutable, meaning its state cannot change once it has been created. This guarantees that any thread accessing the object always gets consistent values and there are no concurrency issues. Another option is to synchronize access to shared resources across threads, but this involves more complex code than immutability and may still present some risk of race conditions. The best solution is often to design classes in a thread-safe manner based on specific requirements and constraints of your system architecture and business logic.
## 2.2 Blocking vs Non-Blocking I/O
When working with input/output operations in Java, programmers sometimes encounter situations where their programs become blocked waiting for certain events or resources to complete, resulting in poor performance or deadlocks. A simple example would be when one thread reads data from a socket, while another thread needs to write data back to the same socket. If both threads block waiting for each other, neither can proceed until the other completes, leading to a deadlock situation. To avoid these scenarios, programmers can either choose non-blocking I/O mechanisms such as NIO or Asynchronous IO, or handle the potential blocking scenario properly by providing timeout options and interruptible methods.

Now let us dive into exploring the different types of streams available in Java and their characteristics.

## 3.1 Stream Types
There are several types of streams available in Java:

- Input stream: An InputStream is used to read data from a source such as a file, network connection, etc., and process it. Examples include FileInputStream, BufferedReader, SocketInputStream, and ByteArrayInputStream.
- Output stream: An OutputStream is used to write data to a destination such as a file, network connection, console output, etc., and send it out to the recipient. Examples include FileOutputStream, BufferedWriter, PrintWriter, and ByteArrayOutputStream.
- Byte stream: A byte stream is a special type of stream that operates on bytes rather than characters. It provides specialized methods for handling primitive data types such as int, long, float, double, char, boolean, and byte, among others. Examples include DataInputStream, ObjectOutputStream, PushbackInputStream, and ByteArrayInputStream.
- Character stream: A character stream is a special type of stream that handles textual data instead of binary data. Its primary purpose is to simplify interactions between strings and streams, making it easier to manipulate text files and convert streams to strings. Examples include FileReader, StringReader, BufferedReader, and InputStreamReader.
All streams implement the Closeable interface, allowing them to be closed after use to free up resources. Additionally, streams support mark() and reset() operations, which allow developers to navigate through a stream and return to a previously marked position later.

## 3.2 Stream Characteristics
Stream characteristics provide information about what kind of data can be processed by a given stream and what kinds of operations can be performed on it. Here is a summary of some commonly used characteristics:

- Single-use: Most streams are single-use, meaning they can only be used once. Once the contents of a stream have been consumed, further attempts to read from or write to it will result in an exception being thrown. Some exceptions to this rule include peek(), markSupported(), and reset().
- Stateless: A stream is stateless, meaning its internal state does not persist between uses. This means that if the underlying resource being accessed changes during a session, the stream needs to be recreated. However, most streams that involve reading or writing to external resources offer optional caching capabilities that can help improve performance. For example, BufferedReader caches lines so that subsequent calls toreadLine() do not need to repeatedly seek to the beginning of the file.
- Intermediary: Some streams act as intermediaries between producers and consumers of data. These include FilteredStream, PeekingIterator, LimitedInputStream, CountingOutputStream, SkipListener, and TeeOutputStream. These streams pass data along unmodified, performing additional transformations or actions on it at the boundaries between producers and consumers.
- Sorting and Grouping: Certain streams can sort or group the elements produced by another stream, typically using a comparator function or key extraction strategy. For example, sorted() takes an ordered stream and returns a sorted version, while collectingAndThen() groups results according to a downstream collector.
- Merging and Joining: Several streams can merge or join multiple inputs together. Merging streams generally require specifying a merge policy, such as accumulating entries into a list or combining them into a single value. Joining streams involve matching pairs of elements from separate sources based on a common attribute or key, and then combining them together into a single entity. For example, IntStream.range() generates integers and LongStream.concat() concatenates streams of longs.


By now, we have reviewed the basic concepts of thread safety, blocking I/O, and different types of Java streams. Next, we'll look at some practical examples of using pipes and streams to solve common problems in Java applications, including reading from files, filtering data, transforming data, sorting, grouping, joining, merging, and aggregating data sets.
