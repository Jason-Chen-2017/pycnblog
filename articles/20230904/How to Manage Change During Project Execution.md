Change management is a critical aspect of successful project execution that requires attention to detail and skill at different stages in the process from scoping and requirements gathering to implementation and deployment. It involves identifying changes required during development, managing them effectively throughout the lifecycle of the product or service, evaluating their impact on customers, stakeholders, and other parties involved in the project, communicating and coordinating changes with all relevant parties and ensuring a smooth transition between iterations and releases. This article will help you understand how to manage change as it pertains to software projects and provide insights into what should be considered when planning for any type of software development project.

# 2.定义、概念和术语
Change management: The act of managing the evolution and maintenance of an organization’s products, services, and infrastructure over time through various channels such as marketing, sales, customer support, and engineering. 

Project Lifecycle Management (PLM): A comprehensive set of processes and tools used to plan, organize, coordinate, control, and monitor the entire lifecycle of a software project. It includes activities such as scope definition, resource allocation, risk identification and mitigation, team formation, cost estimation and budget planning, and client communication and feedback monitoring.

Scrum Master: An experienced Scrum role who has responsibility for guiding and supporting the Agile teams to deliver high-quality software by breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable tasks and achieving productivity gains through collaboration, decision making, transparency, and continuous improvement.

Agile Methodology: A framework or methodology for developing software iteratively using short development cycles, breaking big projects down into smaller, sustainable pieces called “sprints” which are completed within a specific period of time. It was popularized in the mid-2000s and has become increasingly accepted in industry, academia, and government.

Iterative Development Process: A way of working that involves incrementally building functionality and producing a software solution in small batches instead of trying to produce one large, monolithic product. Instead of working towards completion of a project, developers break it down into smaller, more manageable components that can be easily integrated and tested before moving onto new ones.

Sustainability: Sustained growth and success over a long term, with high quality output and low financial burden for the company. This involves balancing multiple competing priorities, meeting customer needs, and maintaining a healthy workforce.

Customer Experience (CX): Refers to the overall perception and satisfaction achieved by clients after interacting with a brand, product, or service. CX factors include ease of use, engagement, loyalty, credibility, trustworthiness, responsiveness, and perceived value.

Stakeholder: Any person involved in a project from beginning to end, including the project sponsor, development team members, users, suppliers, partners, regulators, influencers, executives, etc.

Release Cycle: A regular cadence in which the entire software development cycle, starting from requirements gathering and design through testing, release, and delivery, takes place. Release cycles range from monthly to quarterly depending on the size of the project.

Risk Management: Identifying potential risks early in the development process and minimizing them through effective planning, risk assessment, and contingency plans. Risk management may involve conducting user acceptance tests, analyzing test results, or observing behavioral patterns among users.

Continuous Improvement: Continuously evolving the project by applying new techniques, technologies, and methods to improve its efficiency and effectiveness. Continuous improvement improves business outcomes by reducing time to market, costs, errors, and delivering better value to customers.

## 3.1 Planning Stage
### Scope Definition
Scope definition refers to identifying the functional and nonfunctional requirements of the software application being developed, along with any constraints imposed on the resources available. A detailed list of these items constitutes the project's scope document, which outlines the expectations and goals of the project. This document provides a blueprint for both the development team and the customer.

In addition to defining the product or feature set, the scope definition phase also includes determining the target market, determining the preferred format for documentation, setting deadlines, establishing milestones, and setting the priorities of the project's backlog items. These documents are essential for the project team to stay on track while completing each sprint, and ensure they meet all milestone criteria.

During this stage, it’s important to keep in mind several key points:

1. Plan well ahead of time. Define clear roles and responsibilities to avoid any confusion or miscommunication.
2. Focus on deliverables. Stay focused on the desired features and functionality needed for the next iteration.
3. Ensure clarity and consistency across the organization. Communicate the scope clearly and consistently so everyone knows what to expect.

To create a good scope definition, follow these steps:

1. Understand the problem. Read about the business case behind the project and identify the need for a new product or service.
2. Get input from stakeholders. Talk to people familiar with the domain and get their perspective on the project.
3. Create a hypothesis. Generate ideas and concepts to refine your understanding of the problem space.
4. Breakdown the problem. Think critically about the system architecture, data flow, and interdependencies to come up with a technical roadmap.
5. Set measurable objectives. Develop metrics and KPIs based on your analysis to determine progress toward completion.
6. Establish a timeline. Determine when the first version will be released and when additional features will be added.
7. Collate artifacts. Collect all necessary materials, such as specifications, wireframes, mockups, prototypes, and documentation, and store them securely for reference later.

### Resource Allocation
Resource allocation is responsible for allocating the appropriate amount of effort and resources to complete the project successfully. It involves assigning the correct number of engineers and analysts to work on each task, prioritizing work, and keeping track of dependencies and blockers.

Before proceeding to the next step, it’s important to have a well-defined project plan and a prioritized backlog. Additionally, make sure that the development team is capable of tackling the complexity of the project without becoming overwhelmed. Make sure you allocate enough time for the scrum master, the product owner, and other stakeholders to participate in daily standup meetings and retrospectives. Finally, review the schedule and adjust if necessary based on unexpected delays.

To properly manage resource allocation, follow these steps:

1. Allocate resources efficiently. Assign equal amounts of time and effort to each member, considering individual skills, experience, and availability.
2. Prioritize workload. Use a simple algorithm like Harris-Stowe or Fibonacci sequence to assign relative importance to tasks.
3. Monitor progress. Check in frequently with stakeholders to assess progress and make necessary adjustments.
4. Address bottlenecks. If there are issues with certain tasks taking too long or being blocked, consider reassigning them to another engineer or a department.

### Risk Management
Risk management involves identifying potential risks throughout the development life cycle and planning strategies to minimize or manage them. They typically fall under three categories: technology risk, operational risk, and economic risk.

Technology risk relates to hardware and software dependencies, coding standards, programming practices, and platform limitations. Operational risk covers issues related to training, staffing, and procedures, as well as issues caused by third-party integrations and interactions. Economic risk addresses the uncertainty created by competitors' aggressive pricing strategy, customer demand, and changing market conditions.

The objective of risk management is to prevent unwanted technical debt, lost revenue, and losses due to human error. To achieve this goal, implement measures like automated testing, code reviews, and issue tracking systems to detect bugs and vulnerabilities quickly. Conduct user acceptance testing to validate user stories and ensure customer satisfaction levels remain above average.

Follow these steps to manage risk:

1. Assess risk. Identify potential threats and vulnerabilities that could affect the project.
2. Identify mitigation strategies. Implement prevention measures to reduce or eliminate risks.
3. Implement safeguards. Encourage employees to adopt best practices and discourage bad habits.
4. Communicate risk and threat information. Share alerts and warnings with the rest of the team.

### Team Formation
Team formation refers to the creation of a cross-functional team consisting of product managers, engineers, designers, and others involved in the project. Each team member must possess sufficient knowledge and skills to execute the project and meet deadlines. The team itself consists of diverse individuals with complementary skills that contribute to creating a cohesive unit.

To formulate a great team, start by identifying the main roles and responsibilities within the project. Then, hire individuals with varying backgrounds and expertise to ensure a wide spectrum of perspectives are represented on the team. Consider adding subject matter experts (SMEs) from outside the project team to assist in the decision-making process. Another crucial element in team formation is cultivating communication skills. Employees must communicate openly and transparently with all parties interested in the project.

After formulating the team structure, distribute tasks among the team members according to their expertise and allocated time frames. Schedule weekly check-ins to discuss progress, resolve blocking issues, and collaborate on solutions. Overtime policies, vacation rules, and travel arrangements can also be established to balance workload and strengthen relationships.

Finally, recognize that it’s impossible to develop a perfect team and adapt to changing circumstances throughout the course of the project. Keep focus on maintaining a positive and growing culture by encouraging creativity, teamwork, and curiosity.

### Cost Estimation And Budget Planning
Cost estimation involves calculating the total cost of ownership for the project by aggregating all expenses, such as salaries, rent, equipment, and licenses. Budget planning involves carefully estimating the money necessary to complete the project, accounting for any ongoing costs, and tracking the funds spent during the project's lifetime. Both activities are essential to managing cash flow and limiting waste.

To estimate the right price point, consult with internal and external stakeholders, especially those affected by the project's impact on finances, such as executives, shareholders, contractors, and suppliers. Also, don't forget to factor in inflation and taxes when estimating costs.

Establish a cost evaluation matrix that includes estimates of expected benefits, capital expenses, fixed costs, variable costs, and overhead. Use historical data and projection models to forecast future trends and anticipate any uncertainties. Document all assumptions, calculations, and models to clarify the purpose and accuracy of the analysis.

Once the project has been estimated and budgeted, it’s vital to maintain accurate records and track progress against the original estimates. Communicate the status of the project to stakeholders regularly and address any concerns or challenges that arise. Regularly update the budget with the latest figures to reflect any recent changes or additions made during the project's lifecycle.

Overall, project planning is essential to ensuring a successful software project and addressing many of the common challenges faced by organizations today. With the right approach and guidance, companies can build stronger software products and maintain sustainable growth rates.
