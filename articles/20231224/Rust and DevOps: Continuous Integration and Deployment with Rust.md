### 2.2 Continuous Integration and Deployment

Continuous integration (CI) is a practice that involves regularly merging code changes into a shared repository, where automated tests are run to ensure that the code is functioning correctly. Continuous deployment (CD) is an extension of CI that involves automatically deploying the tested code to production.

CI/CD is an essential part of the DevOps culture, as it enables teams to quickly identify and fix issues, and to deliver high-quality software to customers. By automating the testing and deployment process, teams can reduce the time and effort required to release new features and updates, and can improve the overall reliability and stability of their software.

- For GitLab CI/CD, add additional jobs to the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying to production..."
    - # Custom deployment commands
```
