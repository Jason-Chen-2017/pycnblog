Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed, globally distributed, multi-model database service that provides horizontal scaling, high availability, and predictable performance. It supports multiple data models, including key-value, document, column-family, and graph. Azure Cosmos DB is designed to be a globally distributed database service, with the ability to automatically scale and distribute data across multiple regions.

Serverless computing is a cloud computing paradigm that allows developers to build and run applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. In serverless computing, the cloud provider manages the infrastructure, and the developer only pays for the compute and storage resources that are actually used.

In this article, we will explore the role of Azure Cosmos DB in serverless computing, and provide a comprehensive overview of its features and capabilities. We will also discuss the challenges and opportunities that serverless computing presents, and the future of serverless computing and Azure Cosmos DB.
