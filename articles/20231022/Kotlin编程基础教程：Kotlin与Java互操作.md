# 1.背景介绍


Kotlin是一个由JetBrains开发的静态ally typed language for the JVM, Android, and JavaScript platforms. It is a cross-platform language that offers many advantages over Java including enhanced productivity, safer code, and easier maintenance. Today, it is one of the most popular languages among software developers who are interested in writing reliable and efficient software applications. 

In this article we will learn about Kotlin's key features and how to use them effectively to interact with existing Java libraries or frameworks. We will also cover some fundamental concepts such as null safety, type inference, and operator overloading to help us write better Kotlin programs. Finally, we will explore advanced topics like coroutines and multi-threaded programming which make building asynchronous and concurrent systems easier in Kotlin.

Before starting, please note that although Kotlin is compatible with Java, we recommend using it instead because it provides many benefits compared to Java such as improved syntax and reduced boilerplate code. Therefore, all examples shown in this tutorial will be written in Kotlin.
# 2.核心概念与联系
## Null Safety
In object-oriented programming, null references refer to objects that have not been assigned a valid value. The absence of an object reference indicates that there is no corresponding instance of an object at any given point in time. This can cause various runtime errors due to exceptions being thrown when attempting to access null variables or dereference null pointers. To prevent these issues, Kotlin enforces the concept of nullable types by allowing variables to either hold values or a special "null" value. A variable declared as nullable may contain its normal value (non-null) or the null value. When compiling, Kotlin checks whether every use of a nullable variable has been checked beforehand, thus ensuring that no null pointer exception occurs during execution.

By default, all non-primitive data types in Kotlin are nullable unless explicitly annotated otherwise. For example, String?, Int? etc., whereas Boolean, Byte, Short, Long, Float, Double, Char are non-nullable. In other words, if you try to assign null to a non-nullable variable, you'll get a compilation error. Similarly, if you call a method on a nullable variable without checking if it's null first, you might encounter a NullPointerException. Here's an example:

```kotlin
fun greet(name: String?) {
    // name could be null here!
    println("Hello ${name?: "stranger"}!")
}
greet(null)   // output: Hello stranger!
```

In this example, `greet` function takes a nullable string parameter called `name`. If the argument passed to `greet` is indeed null, then it would print "Hello stranger!" because the ternary operator `?:` returns `"stranger"` as the result since `name` was actually null. On the other hand, if `name` had a valid value, say `"John"`, then the ternary operator would return it instead.

To enable nullability annotations in your own project, add the following line to your build.gradle file inside the `dependencies` section:

```groovy
compile "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk7:${kotlin_version}"
```

And set the kotlin version used within the project using the `ext` block in the top level build.gradle file. Also ensure that the stdlib dependency matches the same version specified in the `buildscript` dependencies block: 

```groovy
ext.kotlin_version = '1.3.21'

buildscript {
   repositories {
       jcenter()
   }
   dependencies {
       classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
   }
}
repositories {
   mavenCentral()
}
```

Here's another example of declaring a variable as nullable:

```kotlin
val myInt: Int? = null // Declaring a nullable integer variable
println(myInt?.inc())    // Output: null

val myStr: String? = "hello"
// Assigning null to myStr violates nullability contract
myStr = null  
println(myStr?.length)   // Output: null
```

As expected, trying to increment `myInt`, even though it's declared as nullable, throws a NPE since it doesn't have a valid value yet. Trying to access the length of `myStr` after assigning it null results in null again.

## Type Inference
Type inference refers to the process of automatically determining the data type of a variable based on its initialization expression or assignment statement. In Java, explicit declaration of data types is necessary whenever creating a new variable, which can lead to verbose and repetitive code. However, in Kotlin, type inference makes things much simpler. Instead of specifying the data type each time a variable is created, the compiler infers its type from the initializer expression. Here's an example:

```kotlin
var x = 1    // inferred type is Int
var y = 1L   // inferred type is Long
var z = true // inferred type is Boolean
```

If you want to declare multiple variables together, you can do so using the semicolon separator:

```kotlin
var (a, b) = arrayOf(1, "two") 
// a is Int and b is String, both inferred
```

It's worth noting that Kotlin uses smart casts to perform automatic conversion between data types when needed, but you should still always use explicit conversions where necessary to avoid unexpected behavior. For example, converting an Int to a Double without casting would lose precision:

```kotlin
val i = 1
val d = i.toDouble()     // No implicit conversion - loses precision
val f = i.toFloat().toDouble() // Uses explicit conversion to retain precision
```

The second line shows how to work around this issue by explicitly converting the Int to a Float followed by a double. Note that the resulting Double retains full precision up to two decimal places.

Another advantage of type inference is that it helps prevent bugs caused by type coercion, where values of different data types are treated as if they were of the same type. Although type inference works well for simple expressions and statements, it may produce incorrect results when dealing with complex situations involving generics and inheritance.

## Operator Overloading
Operator overloading allows us to define custom operators for our classes or objects, enabling us to use familiar mathematical symbols and keywords in our code. Common operators include arithmetic operators (+,-,*,/), comparison operators (>, <, >=, <=), logical operators (!, &&, ||), indexing ([]) and slicing (slice). Unlike Java, Kotlin does not allow overriding certain built-in operators such as equals(), hashCode() or toString(). To overload a particular operator, simply define a method whose name consists of the symbol or keyword preceded by the `@operator` annotation.

For example, let's define a Point class with `+` and `-` operators defined to represent vector addition and subtraction respectively:

```kotlin
data class Point(val x: Int, val y: Int) {
  @JvmName("+")
  operator fun plus(other: Point): Point {
    return Point(x + other.x, y + other.y)
  }

  @JvmName("-")
  operator fun minus(other: Point): Point {
    return Point(x - other.x, y - other.y)
  }
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
  var p1 = Point(1, 2)
  var p2 = Point(3, 4)
  
  println(p1 + p2)      // prints "(4, 6)"
  println(p2 - p1)      // prints "(2, 2)"
}
```

In this example, we've used the `@JvmName` annotation to provide unique names for our methods. By convention, Kotlin generates an implementation for each member that needs to be called from Java. However, the JvmName annotation tells the compiler to generate Java bytecode with specific names for those functions rather than auto-generated ones. Alternatively, we can skip the annotation and rely on the compiler to infer the appropriate names itself.

Now, we can easily add and subtract points using the familiar `+` and `-` symbols. We don't need to worry about the underlying logic or representation of the Point class, just the ability to manipulate it mathematically using basic algebraic operations.
