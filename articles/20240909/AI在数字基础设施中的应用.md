# Sample data
X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]])
y = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1])

# Decision Tree Classifier
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()
clf.fit(X, y)

# Classify Infrastructure Damage Severity
new_data = [[2, 3], [6, 7]]
predictions = clf.predict(new_data)

print("Predictions:", predictions)
```
