# 1.背景介绍


监督学习是机器学习中的一个重要分支，它在实际应用中起着至关重要的作用。一般地，监督学习包括分类、回归和聚类三种任务。本文将对监督学习中的三种算法进行阐述，并介绍其基本原理及对应实际问题。

监督学习是一种基于训练样本的数据挖掘技术，通过对输入数据进行正确的标签输出学习到模型参数或函数的映射关系，以用于预测或者分析其他数据的结果。监督学习由三种主要任务组成：分类、回归和聚类。其中，分类是监督学习中的一项重要任务，其目标是在给定一组训练数据集上确定某些输入实例属于哪个类别。例如，给定一张图片，识别出图片是否是美女，是否是动物，或者是否是男生。分类任务可以分为二类或多类分类任务。二类分类任务是指输入的样本只能属于两个类别，如是否为垃圾邮件或正常邮件；而多类分类任务是指输入的样本可以属于多个类别，如图像分类问题。回归任务则是利用输入变量的值预测输出变量的值，例如预测房价或销售额等连续值的问题。聚类任务的目标是在给定一组无监督数据集上发现隐藏的结构模式。

# 2.核心概念与联系
## （1）Supervised Learning（监督学习）
- Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the desired output or label for each input sample (or example) is provided as training data. 

- In supervised learning, we have both inputs and outputs and our goal is to learn a function that maps input patterns to output values based on those labeled examples. 

- The mapping function takes in new, unseen data samples and predicts their corresponding output values using the learned model parameters.

- Supervised learning can be further classified into two types: 
    - classification: which involves tasks like image classification, text classification, etc., where the output variable consists of discrete categories or classes.
    - regression: which involves tasks like prediction of continuous variables such as stock prices or sales amounts.


## （2）Classification（分类）

In supervised learning, Classification refers to problems where the aim is to assign an input data point to one of several predefined classes or groups based on its features or attributes. It includes binary classification, multi-class classification, and multi-label classification.

1. Binary classification (also called logistic regression): In this task, the target variable has only two possible outcomes/classes, either “0” or “1”. For instance, predicting whether a patient has diabetes or not given medical test results. 

2. Multi-class classification: This task involves assigning input data points to multiple distinct classes. These classes are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. For instance, identifying different types of animals from images or audio clips. 

3. Multi-label classification: In this task, multiple labels may be assigned to each input data point. Each label indicates the presence or absence of a particular attribute or characteristic. For instance, tagging images with multiple objects or topics. 


## （3）Regression（回归）

Regression is another important subtask of supervised learning that deals with predicting numerical or real-valued outputs by fitting a mathematical equation to observed data. Regression models include linear regression, polynomial regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), neural networks, and deep learning algorithms.

For example, predicting house price based on location, size, number of bedrooms, age, and other factors. 
- Linear Regression: A simple linear regression assumes a straight line between the independent and dependent variables, making predictions according to the formula y = b + w * x, where b is the intercept and w is the slope. 
- Polynomial Regression: More complex models can be used to fit non-linear relationships between the input and output variables through a transformation of the original space. Polynomial regression fits a curve to the residual sum of squares between predicted and actual outputs of the model.
