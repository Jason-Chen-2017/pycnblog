在智能手机和互联网的普及背景下，越来越多的人开始接受电子化的医疗服务。近年来，基于计算机视觉的自动识别技术（AR）应用层出不穷，这些技术已经能够提供全面的影像信息，从而实现诊断、治疗等各种功能。通过AR技术可以实现一站式的医疗服务，让患者能够通过虚拟面相机访问医生的治疗建议，而不需要进入医院。因此，基于AR技术的在线医疗咨询成为当前医疗领域中的热点话题。但由于存在着众多的研究成果和应用场景，没有统一的标准来定义并标准化相关的技术。本文将围绕这一主题，对AR技术在医疗领域的发展进行综述性的论述。文章主要包括以下几个方面：
1. AR技术的基本概念及历史演变
2. 基于AR的医疗图像理解与特征提取技术
3. 基于AR的医疗图像检索技术
4. 基于AR的在线医疗服务系统设计与研发
5. 基于AR的在线医疗服务业务模式
6. 未来的发展方向与技术难点
7. 总结

## 2.1 AR(Augmented Reality)
Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that overlays virtual objects on the real-world environment to provide a more immersive and interactive experience for users. It was first introduced in 1994 by <NAME> as part of his PhD research at Carnegie Mellon University's Institute for Augmented Human Environment Research. Its use cases range from medical imaging to mobile gaming, personal digital assistants, and art installations. AR has been rapidly expanding since its introduction because it offers several advantages over traditional methods:

1. Increased engagement: Users are able to interact with the augmented content using natural gestures or voice commands without leaving their physical environment. This enables them to explore new ideas, complete tasks faster, and focus on what matters most. 

2. Reduced cognitive load: Since there are fewer distractions than when interacting with an isolated world, users can focus better and complete complex tasks more efficiently. 

3. Improved visual understanding: Users can see and understand the surrounding world even though they may not be able to physically move around. This allows them to make sense of complex situations and solve problems more quickly. 

As AR technologies have become increasingly popular, many companies have developed software tools and applications specifically designed to work with AR devices such as smartphones and tablets. These include software frameworks like Vuforia, which provides cloud-based image recognition services, as well as consumer-oriented applications like Google Lens and Apple ARKit.

AR uses computer vision algorithms to recognize images and video streams and overlay them on top of the user's view of the real world. The algorithm analyzes the input stream to identify features such as faces, buildings, trees, and landmarks, and then creates three-dimensional models based on those features. These models can include text, images, and videos, allowing the user to interact with them through their eyes or hands.

A common misconception about AR is that it replaces the need for traditional medical procedures. While this is true for some scenarios, it fails to address other critical areas like patient safety and accessibility. Traditional practices such as performing x-rays, sterilization, and biopsies remain essential in modern life despite these benefits provided by AR. Additionally, specialized training and education programs can help improve the effectiveness of AR in various settings, including hospitals, clinics, and emergency rooms.

## 2.2 Marker(标志物)
A marker, also known as a fiducial mark, is any distinguishable feature on an object or surface that helps an observer locate it accurately within the field of view. Markers typically consist of one or more small dots or patterns, often found along the edges of surfaces where the object or surface would otherwise be difficult to distinguish visually. Different markers serve different functions in AR, ranging from identifying individual objects or points of interest to providing contextual information about the location of nearby features. Some commonly used markers include QR codes, barcode tags, and Aruco markers. Arucos are widely used for robotic localization, tracking targets, and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping). In addition to markers, AR systems typically rely on camera data, especially depth maps, to obtain information about the size, shape, and orientation of objects within the scene.
