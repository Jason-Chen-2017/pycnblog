14. Avoid Overlapping Memory Access - CUDA, which is a parallel computing platform designed specifically for graphics processing units, has strict requirements on memory access patterns to maximize throughput. To minimize the impact of overlapping memory accesses, we can reuse intermediate variables, buffer computations, and optimize data layout to minimize redundant memory reads.
