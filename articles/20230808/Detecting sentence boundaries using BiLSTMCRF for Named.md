8. Detecting sentence boundaries using BiLSTM-CRF for Named Entity Recognition: In this post, we describe a novel approach for detecting sentence boundaries in text data using BiLSTM-CRF based sequence labeling models. We showcase the benefits of this approach over previous heuristics based solutions, explain how it works, and give examples of its performance on real-world datasets.
