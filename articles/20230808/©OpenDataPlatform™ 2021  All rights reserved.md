          ### Data Ingestion Engine Module
          The Data Ingestion Engine module is responsible for ingesting new data streams into the system. It uses Apache Kafka message brokering service to receive incoming data streams. When a new stream arrives, it is automatically added to the list of available streams. For each stream, the Data Ingestion Engine creates a separate Kafka topic so that all related events can be delivered atomically to the destination systems. Each event includes metadata about the originating system, timestamp information, and raw data itself. 

          To ensure high reliability, the Data Ingestion Engine uses techniques such as replication, batching, and error handling mechanisms to make sure that no individual event loss occurs during the process of delivering data. It also integrates with external databases for auditing purposes and makes it easy to track down errors if needed.

          At present, the Data Ingestion Engine supports several protocols such as FTP, SFTP, SMTP, Telnet, TCP/IP sockets, JDBC, ODBC, HL7v2, and JSON formats. Additional integration options will be added in future releases.

          Here's how you can configure the Data Ingestion Engine for your specific requirements:

          1. Set up Kafka Brokers: You need to set up one or more Kafka brokers within your network to act as the message transportation hub. Kafka comes with pre-built scripts that you can run on your Linux server to install and start a Kafka instance within minutes. Additionally, you can deploy Kafka clusters on public clouds like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.  
          2. Create Kafka Topics: Once the Kafka broker(s) are running, you need to create topics for each stream you want to consume. These topics define the schema of the data being transmitted, ensuring consistency and traceability between systems.   
          3. Configure Connectors: After creating topics, you need to configure connectors that connect to the source of the data. These connectors will read data from the input source, convert it to Avro format, and send it through the Kafka topic to the Data Ingestion Engine. There are many types of connectors available, ranging from generic ones like file sources and database sources, to specialized ones like those for IoT devices, industrial sensors, and social media platforms.
          4. Monitor Performance: Finally, once the configuration is complete, you should monitor the performance of the system to detect any issues or bottlenecks. Specific metrics you might want to collect include ingestion rate, message size, connection time, and failure rates.
          ### Data Processing Engine Module
          The Data Processing Engine module is responsible for receiving data streams, extracting relevant information, cleaning and enriching the data, and forwarding it to the appropriate destinations. It uses Apache Spark framework for processing data streams in batches and streaming modes.

          The basic flow of data processing involves the following steps:

          1. Receive Streaming Data: Data streamed from the previous stage is received and processed in real-time by Spark Structured Streaming component. Structured Streaming receives live input data streams, applies user-defined transformations, updates the result table incrementally, and outputs results to the next stage in near real-time.
          2. Extract Relevant Information: The extracted data is then filtered, transformed, cleaned, and enriched according to the specified logic. Multiple filters, transforms, cleaners, and enrichers can be applied depending upon the nature of the data and the application scenario.
          3. Store Processed Data: The final output after applying filtering, transformation, cleaning, and enrichment is stored back in a reliable location for further consumption by downstream systems. This step ensures data integrity and provides support for data recovery in case of failures.
          
          Here's how you can configure the Data Processing Engine for your specific requirements:

          1. Choose the Right Executor Mode: Spark Structured Streaming provides two execution modes - Batch and Continuous. Choosing the right mode depends on the nature of your data and whether there is a need for real-time processing. You can experiment with both modes to find the best fit for your solution.
          2. Set Up Cluster: Before setting up the Data Processing Engine, you must set up a Spark cluster consisting of Spark Master node and one or more Worker nodes. Depending on the scale and complexity of your workload, you may choose to split these roles among multiple machines.  
          3. Load Test Your Solution: Load testing plays a crucial role in optimizing the efficiency of your Data Processing Engine. You can test the performance of your solution under varying loads and scenarios, observing the impact of changing parameters like executor memory, number of executors, and parallelism level.  
          4. Configure Spark Jobs: After choosing the correct mode and load testing the solution, you can start configuring your Spark jobs. These jobs specify the exact sequence of operations to be performed on incoming data, along with data sources and sinks. Examples include reading from Hive tables, writing to Parquet files, aggregating data, joining data sets, and performing machine learning algorithms.
          5. Debug Any Issues: Finally, don't forget to debug any issues that occur during the process of loading data, processing it, and storing it back in a reliable location. The Data Processing Engine logs help identify problems and resolve them quickly.  
          
          ### Business Intelligence Platform Module
          The Business Intelligence Platform module is responsible for analyzing and visualizing collected data, enabling businesses to gain meaningful insights into their business processes and decision-making processes. It uses popular BI tools like Tableau, QlikSense, MicroStrategy, Oracle Hyperion, Power BI, and SAP BW/BW Lite to generate interactive reports and dashboards.

          The Business Intelligence Platform integrates with the rest of the OpenDataPlatform ecosystem using RESTful APIs and advanced data visualization techniques like drill-down analysis and geospatial mapping. With AI capabilities, it can suggest actions based on patterns identified in the data and predict outcomes based on historical trends.

          Here's how you can configure the Business Intelligence Platform for your specific requirements:

          1. Install BI Tools: Various BI tools like Tableau, QlikSense, MicroStrategy, Oracle Hyperion, Power BI, and SAP BW/BW Lite come packed with in-built functionality that can help with reporting, analysis, and modeling of data. You just need to install the required tool on your local computer or server, and get started building custom reports and dashboards.  
          2. Connect to Data Sources: The Business Intelligence Platform connects to data sources like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Oracle DB, Salesforce, and Azure SQL Database using standardized interfaces like JDBC, ODBC, and OData. You can access and visualize data directly within the tool interface or build custom queries and reports using scripting languages like SQL, JavaScript, and Phoenix.  
          3. Use Advanced Visualizations: Chart libraries like D3.js, Highcharts, or Google Charts enable you to build sophisticated, interactive data visualizations with ease. You can drag-and-drop elements onto the canvas, customize colors, labels, legends, and tooltips, and export the resulting images or charts for sharing.  
          4. Integrate with External Systems: By leveraging the power of modern IT infrastructure and cloud technologies, you can integrate the Business Intelligence Platform with third-party systems like marketing automation tools, CRM platforms, and ERP systems. This way, you can aggregate data from multiple sources and correlate it with business intelligence and operational metrics to make informed decisions.

          ### 数据源配置示例
          ```
          {
              "name": "my-ftp",
              "type": "FTP",
              "config": {
                  "host": "localhost",
                  "port": 21,
                  "username": "anonymous",
                  "password": "",
                  "passiveMode": true,
                  "useBinaryMode": false,
                  "disconnectOnUnreadData": true,
                  "remoteDir": "/",
                  "charsetName": "UTF-8"
              }
          }
          ```
          配置文件中主要字段的含义如下：
          - `name` 表示数据源名称，不能重复；
          - `type` 表示数据源类型，目前支持的文件系统包括`LOCAL`, `FTP`, `SFTP`, `SMTP`, `TELNET`，网络协议包括`TCP/IP`, `JDBC`, `ODBC`, `HL7v2`, 和`JSON`等；
          - `config` 为特定数据源类型的配置信息，每个类型的数据源都有不同的配置项。例如，对于`FTP`类型的数据源，它需要指定主机名、端口号、用户名、密码、模式（主动或被动）、二进制模式、是否关闭未读数据、远程目录以及字符集等参数。如果数据源需要身份认证，则还需要提供相关凭据。除此之外，还有一些通用配置项，比如`batchSize`，`bufferSize`，`pollInterval`，`maxRetries`。
          
          ### 数据分发作业配置示例
          ```
          [
              {
                  "jobType": "stream_file_ingestion",
                  "name": "file-to-kafka",
                  "dataSourceName": "my-ftp",
                  "topics": ["my-topic"],
                  "policy": {}
              },
              {
                  "jobType": "stream_file_parsing",
                  "name": "parser",
                  "dataSourceName": "file-to-kafka",
                  "outputTopic": "parsed-data",
                  "parsers": [
                      {"type": "csv"},
                      {"type": "json"}
                  ]
              }
          ]
          ```
          分发作业配置文件采用YAML格式存储。每一个分发作业都有一个唯一的名字，用来标识这个任务。分发作业由两部分组成：`数据源配置`和`处理配置`。
          - 数据源配置表示这个分发作业读取数据的来源。由于同一个分发作业可能需要读取多个不同的数据源，因此这里的配置是一个数组。每个元素代表一个数据源，通常会包含数据源名称、数据源类型及其相关配置。
          - 处理配置定义了本次分发作业执行的具体逻辑，如从数据源读取数据、解析数据、过滤、转换、清洗等操作。每个分发作业至少包含两个部分：`jobType`和`processors`。
            + `jobType` 表示本次分发作业的类型，目前支持两种类型：`stream_file_ingestion`用于将文件数据流式传输到Kafka集群，`stream_file_parsing`用于将已存储在Kafka中的原始文件数据解析并输出到另一个Kafka主题。
            + `processors` 表示本次分发作业的实际执行逻辑。每个processor代表一个处理步骤，它可以是以下四种类型之一：
              * 文件拷贝，用于将文件从输入目录拷贝到输出目录；
              * 文件过滤，用于基于文件的元数据进行过滤；
              * 文件转换，用于根据指定的格式将文件内容转换为其他格式；
              * 文件编解码，用于对原始文件数据进行二进制编码和解码。
            + 如果存在多个processors，它们之间可以串联起来，形成一个处理管道，用于完成整个分发作业的工作。
            
            在这个例子中，一个分发作业用于将原始文件从FTP服务器上读取，然后将CSV格式的内容解析输出到Kafka主题`parsed-data`。该分发作业的配置包括两个部分：
            * 数据源配置，表示从FTP服务器上读取文件数据。它只包含一个元素，即来自`my-ftp`的数据源。
            * 处理配置，包含两个processor。第一个processor为`文件拷贝`，用于将文件从FTP服务器上的`/data/`目录拷贝到当前运行环境的临时目录。第二个processor为`文件转换`，用于将文件从CSV格式转换为JSON格式，并输出到`parsed-data`主题。
