17. Efficient Input Pipeline - An input pipeline is responsible for loading and preprocessing data batches efficiently into memory. Inefficient input pipelines can cause bottlenecks in the system and delay the training process. Optimized input pipelines can lead to improved performance by reducing disk I/O operations, minimizing memory copies, and prefetching next batches asynchronously.
