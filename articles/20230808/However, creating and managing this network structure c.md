However, creating and managing this network structure can quickly become complex and time-consuming. To address this issue, researchers have developed simpler versions of neural networks known as deep learning models. Despite their name, these models are often referred to simply as "neural networks," making it difficult to determine exactly what kind of model was used during training.
