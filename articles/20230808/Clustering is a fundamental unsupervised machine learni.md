Clustering is a fundamental unsupervised machine learning task that groups similar data points together into clusters. In this article, we will learn about the K-Means clustering algorithm and implement it in Python using scikit-learn library. We will also discuss how to select appropriate values for k (number of clusters) and evaluate the quality of clustered results using metrics such as silhouette score, elbow method, and dunn index.
