 I have a deep understanding of the entire consumer journey, from first touch through purchase to return lifecycle management. Involved in several marketing campaigns for brands such as Disney, Intel, and Shell, I have demonstrated a strong ability to communicate effectively, present information clearly, and sell products or services accurately. Additionally, I have led multiple successful events, such as Gates Open House and Super Bowl XXXVIII.
