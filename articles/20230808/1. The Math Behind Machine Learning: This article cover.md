 1. "The Math Behind Machine Learning": This article covers the basics behind machine learning such as supervised vs unsupervised learning, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), linear regression, logistic regression, k-means clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), and neural networks. It also goes into detail on backpropagation algorithm used to train deep learning models, including what activation functions should be used and when.
