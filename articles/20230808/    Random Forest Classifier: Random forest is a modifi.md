    Random Forest Classifier: Random forest is a modification of the decision tree algorithm that reduces overfitting by creating multiple decision trees at training time and combining them together to make predictions. Random forests are considered an ensemble learning method that combines multiple classifiers to improve accuracy and reduce variance. Random forest works best with high-dimensional, sparse datasets.
