 在自然语言处理(NLP)中，词嵌入(Word Embedding)，也叫词向量(Word Vectors)，是指一种对词汇的特征向量表示法，能够使得计算机可以准确理解文本信息中的词语关系及其上下文含义。词嵌入方法有基于统计的方法和基于神经网络的方法。本文将介绍两种主流词嵌入方法：word2vec和GloVe。
         ## word2vec
          word2vec是最早提出的词嵌入方法。它使用了跳元模型（Skip-gram）进行训练，跳元模型是一种用来学习分布式表示的模型。在跳元模型中，中心词（target word）根据上下文预测在某一位置出现的词（context words）。因此，目标是最大化下面的目标函数：
          
          $$ -\sum_{t=1}^{T} \sum_{-m\leq j\leq m,j
eq0}\log p(w_t^j | w_t)$$
          
          
          
          
       2.背景介绍
          Word Embeddings are one of the most famous techniques used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). There are several types of embeddings such as distributed representation, dense embedding etc. In this article, we will discuss about two popular methods for generating Word Embeddings: GloVe and Word2Vec. 
         ### Distributed Representation

          A Distributed Representation is a way to represent language in vector form. It provides a continuous space where similar concepts or words have close proximity to each other. The mapping from the textual form of the word to its numerical representation can be learned using machine learning algorithms. One of the key challenges with traditional methods was that they didn't capture semantic relationships between different words. For example, "apple" may share some similarity to "fruit", but it would not share any similarity with "banana". Distributed representations allow us to capture these interactions without explicitly defining them.

          

         ### Definition 
          We define a word embedding as a dense vector space representing the meaning of the word in a fixed dimensional space. Each word is represented by a vector of numbers called an embedding vector which is trained through supervised learning on large datasets of text data. The objective behind training these vectors is to learn the joint probability distribution over all possible pairs of words based on their co-occurrence frequency within the corpus. This gives us a rich set of features that are useful for tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and analogy reasoning. Additionally, because the embedding space captures the contextual semantics of the word, it allows us to compare how similar or dissimilar two words are in terms of their use cases in sentences.

          


          **How does word embeddings work?** 

          When we train a word embedding model, we start by constructing a vocabulary consisting of all unique words in our dataset along with their corresponding integer indices. These integers serve as unique identifiers for every word in our vocabulary. Next, we feed these sequences of integers into an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network architecture which learns to map each word to a high-dimensional vector representation. The dimensions of this vector space depend on the size of the hidden layer in the network, and the number of times we iterate over the input sequence. After training the model, we obtain a matrix of weights W, where each row corresponds to a word's embedding vector and each column represents the weight assigned to each dimension of the vector space.

          Given a new sentence, we first tokenize it into individual tokens. Then, we convert these tokens to their corresponding integer index using our vocabulary dictionary. Finally, we pass this list of integers to the LSTM network to obtain a final output vector representing the entire sentence. To get the embedding vector for a particular word, we simply select the corresponding row from our matrix of weights.

          So what makes a good word embedding?
