1. Data Preparation - One of the major challenges in building a deep learning model is preparing the right datasets. Depending on the size and complexity of the dataset, the process of data cleaning and preprocessing can take a considerable amount of time. Additionally, the time taken to load and preprocess data into appropriate formats increases exponentially when working with large datasets. Therefore, efficiently preparing the dataset is paramount.
