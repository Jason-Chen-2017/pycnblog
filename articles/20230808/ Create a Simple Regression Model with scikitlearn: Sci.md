- Create a Simple Regression Model with scikit-learn: Scikit-learn is a widely used Python library for machine learning tasks. In this tutorial, we will build a simple linear regression model to predict housing prices based on other features like square footage and no. of bedrooms. We'll also use cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance and compare it against other models. Finally, we'll explain the key concepts behind linear regression and understand why it works well for this type of problem.
