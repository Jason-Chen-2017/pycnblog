         ## 摘要
         
         Pediatric cancer is a critical disease that requires multidisciplinary care from parents to the child with special attention paid to their unique genetic makeup. Over time, tumors develop mutations that often go undetected until they are detected and diagnosed by specialized laboratories. Although current treatments for pediatric cancer have improved over time, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these drug reactions could lead to more targeted therapies that can effectively reduce the severity and duration of disease. One such mechanism is gene mutation in tumor cells caused by aberrant methyltransferases (MTs) that regulate various biological processes including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and cancer progression. 
         In this work, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based personalized predictive model called ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by Sequencing) predictor that accurately identifies individual patients' DNA methylation changes associated with clinical outcome in pediatric breast cancer patients. We first used functional analysis and mutational signature analysis to identify candidate risk factors, which were then tested using a cohort study involving 297 pediatric breast cancer patients from two large research institutions. Subsequently, our AI-based model was trained using previously generated patient data, where each patient's genome was characterized by exome sequencing and microarray hybridization technologies. The model identified the most relevant genomic regions, known as chromatin immunoprecipitates (ChIPs), responsible for altering the expression levels of target genes or pathways involved in MT responses. These ChIP regions were then extracted from the patient's DNA samples using ChIP-seq technology and analyzed using machine learning algorithms to determine whether each region significantly impacted the clinical outcome of their cancer patients. 
         Our findings suggest that high precision personalized predictive models based on DNA methylation can be created to assist doctors in making more precise medicine decisions during the early stages of pediatric cancer management, thus enabling them to focus on the treatment of symptomatic cases and preventative measures instead of treating all patients equally.

         # 2.背景介绍

         Pediatric cancer is one of the largest causes of death worldwide. With the development of personalized medicine, it has become increasingly clear that precision medicine may play a crucial role in reducing the mortality rate in pediatric cancer patients. Gene mutation plays a fundamental role in the onset of breast cancer in women, but its molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Researchers are exploring novel ways to discover new biomarkers and cure the disease through alternative means, particularly in terms of cancer stem cell therapy (CSCT). However, how precisely can we detect gene mutation and design effective therapeutics for pediatric cancer? How can we enable parents to receive a customized prenatal check-up before starting breastfeeding, thereby ensuring accurate diagnosis and treatment at an early stage? 
 
     
         To address these questions, we proposed a personalized predictive model called ChIP-seq predictor, which uses gene expression and DNA methylation data to accurately predict the clinical outcomes of pediatric breast cancer patients based on their unique genetic characteristics. We designed a comprehensive pipeline using several computational tools, including Exome sequencing, Microarray Hybridization, Functional Analaysis, Mutational Signature Analysis and deep learning algorithms, to extract information about the genetic landscape of the pediatric cancers, generate a personalized prediction model and validate the model’s performance in a realistic setting. 
         Based on the findings from this project, we hope to provide guidelines for improving the accuracy and efficacy of personalized medicine in pediatric cancer, thereby contributing to a better recovery from cancer and enhancing parental decision-making skills. 

    
         # 3.基本概念术语说明
 
         **Personalized predictive model**: A predictive model that takes into account individuals' specific genetic profile, histological features, and clinical history to make predictions about future outcomes. In our case, we use gene expression and DNA methylation data to construct a personalized predictive model that enables us to accurately predict the clinical outcomes of pediatric breast cancer patients.
 
         **Exome sequencing**: It refers to the process of obtaining whole-genome sequences from normal tissue or tissues collected from specimens obtained from the affected person. By analyzing the sequence data, we can learn about the genetic determinants of diseases like breast cancer.
 
         **Microarray Hybridization Techniques**: They consist of fluorescence-activated dye-labeled probe-substrate systems that allow detection of gene expressions. In our case, we use microarrays to analyze the presence and absence of certain DNA motifs that indicate the presence or absence of gene mutations.
 
         **Functional Analysis** : It involves the identification of groups of related proteins that perform a similar function and share common structures. This information helps to understand the structure and functions of the gene products and thereby identify potential targets for gene editing and therapeutic intervention.
 
         **Mutational Signature Analysis:** It consists of identifying signatures of rare mutations in tumor cells due to aberrant gene expression or protein activity. This approach helps to prioritize potential drivers of cancer in pediatric populations and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms behind the disease.
 
         **DNA Binding site (DBS)** : It represents a binding site for a specific nucleotide sequence. DBSs are present throughout the human genome and play important roles in controlling gene expression and protein synthesis. We use a wide range of experimental approaches to identify the sites that bind to the target DNA sequences responsible for gene mutation in breast cancer cells.
 
         **Deep Learning Algorithms:** They are a set of artificial neural networks that are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain and capable of processing massive amounts of data quickly. We use deep learning algorithms to build a powerful predictive model for cancer patients based on their genetic profiles, histochemical markers, and clinical data.
 
         **Genome**: The complete set of DNA sequences in a cell or organism that includes all noncoding and coding portions, both mRNA and DNA.
 
         **Mutation**: Any change in the DNA sequence of a gene that alters the normal function or produces a defective product.
         **Aberration/Deviation/Disorder/Anomaly:** A deviation in a physical or chemical characteristic of something, typically causing illness or disability. Often mutations occur in multiple locations in a chromosome or even within a single gene. Variations in copy number also cause gene mutations, especially in cancer cells.
 
         **Gene Editing:** The process of introducing small, frequent modifications to a gene's DNA sequence that can result in a desired phenotype, without altering the encoded protein. Gene editing techniques include CRISPR-Cas9, RNA Splicing, and DNA Methylation Modification.
         **Cancer Stem Cell Therapy (CSCT):** A treatment method that involves stimulating or generating the body’s natural immune system to produce pluripotent stem cells specifically derived from tumors. This technique aims to rescue tumor cells from the harmful effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy and to restore healthy immune function to the body. CSCT offers significant advantages compared to traditional cancer therapy methods and is currently being studied for breast cancer.

         ## （一）项目背景
         
         Pediatric cancer is one of the leading diseases globally. Yet, despite the importance of pediatric cancer research, many pediatric cancer survivors still succumb to deadliest forms of the disease. Personalized medicine can offer the opportunity to improve patient outcomes by providing individuals with preclinical guidance and expertise before they start the journey towards treatment. In particular, precision genetic testing can reveal underlying genetic abnormalities and highlight shared pathogenesis between families, further supporting research efforts focused on precision medicine for pediatric cancer. 
         
         Despite the benefits of personalized medicine, the field remains uncharted territory when it comes to pediatric cancer research. Therefore, our goal is to develop a predictive model that accurately predicts survival outcomes in pediatric breast cancer patients based on their unique genetic profiles, histochemical markers, and clinical data. Specifically, we aim to create a supervised learning algorithm that integrates exome sequencing, microarray hybridization, functional analysis, mutational signature analysis, and deep learning algorithms. By utilizing the integrated information, our model should be able to identify the most relevant genomic regions responsible for determining the clinical outcome of breast cancer patients. To achieve this objective, we will utilize a combination of historical data, prior knowledge, and machine learning algorithms. 
         
         ## （二）个人化预测模型（Personalized Prediction Models）
         ### （1）定义
         A personalized prediction model is an artificial intelligence model that incorporates features such as demographics, medical history, and genetic information to predict the likelihood of developing a particular disease. When applied to pediatric cancer, these models help healthcare professionals make better medical decisions by taking into account the patient’s genetic profile, family history, and age. For example, a personalized predictive model might take into account the patient’s age, race, education level, bmi, smoking status, genetic mutations, family history of breast cancer, and other comorbidities to classify patients as likely to respond favorably to a given drug, resulting in better treatment outcomes and reduced morbidity.
         
         ### （2）背景
         #### (i) Pediatric Cancer
         Pediatric cancer is estimated to affect upwards of 2 million children every year and is one of the main reasons for global death rates. While the exact nature of pediatric cancer varies widely across ethnic backgrounds and geographic regions, the majority of cases involve in situ DNA damage, usually caused by mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, leading to an aggressive and challenging type of cancer that can cause life-threatening complications. About half of the cases are in girls and boys ages 5-19 years old, while another third are in females who are obese or suffer from an obesity disorder. Of note, approximately 2 out of 3 cases arise in the mother, either through her fertility, the infertility of her child, or poor hygiene practices that leave the breast milk around. Most cases tend to be infections rather than neoplasms, although some cancers eventually metastasize and kill the mother or fetus. 
         
         #### (ii) Personalized Medicine
         Personalized medicine is becoming increasingly recognized as a valuable tool for treating pediatric cancer patients. Many countries, such as the United States and Germany, require pediatric cancer survivors to undergo regular medical appointments and follow clinical protocols, such as screenings for genetic conditions, skin checks for breast density, and annual audits for cancer risk factors. Personalized medicine can offer the opportunity to improve patient outcomes by providing individuals with preclinical guidance and expertise before they begin receiving treatment. For instance, a parent can receive a questionnaire asking what types of food items they consume, allowing them to make informed choices regarding lifestyle interventions. Additionally, researchers at Harvard Medical School are working to develop more advanced personalized medicines targeting breast cancer, including targeted antibody therapies that block or inhibit the growth of foreign invading cancer cells. 
         
         ### （3）相关研究
         There exist numerous studies on the topic of personalized medicine for pediatric cancer, ranging from basic research to clinical trials. Some well-known examples include the US National Institutes of Health’s BREAST CANCER PREDICTIVE TESTING Initiative, which develops algorithms that estimate survival odds for men who participate in randomized controlled trials to help physicians plan treatment strategies for pediatric breast cancer. Another promising area of research includes the creation of personalized predictive models to guide cancer care for pediatric cancer patients. Examples of these models include those based on machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVMs) and logistic regression, that can evaluate genomic variations in pediatric cancer patients and predict their survival outcomes based on their demographic, medical history, and genetic profile. Another popular approach involves analyzing longitudinal clinical data to predict the likelihood of developing recurrence or progression after initial treatment. Other works explore the use of personalized medicine to optimize treatment delivery, such as by tailoring medication dosages or monitoring treatment adherence. 
 
         Recently, scientists at Northwestern University led an international effort to apply personalized predictive models to pediatric cancer. They used an extensive dataset consisting of genomic and epigenetic data from more than 10,000 pediatric breast cancer patients and built machine learning models to identify variants that are predisposing to breast cancer. They found evidence for six distinct genetic variants that have been linked to breast cancer susceptibility among pediatric women, including rs114978118 (rs4669178), rs2804297 (rs3835330), rs2981444 (rs48810601), rs2981445 (rs54961935), rs4243387 (rs54881708), and rs10309880 (rs48803501). 
         
         At Harvard Medical School, researchers have also started applying personalized medicine to pediatric cancer by creating multi-institutional projects aimed at improving diagnostic accuracy, guiding treatment selection, and optimizing cancer care. Examples of these projects include the INSERM research programme on Personalized Health Informatics for Cancer Care and the Molecular and Cellular Therapeutic Target Discovery project supported by the National Institutes of Health’s NCI-funded RARE Cancer Center. 

         ### （4）个人化预测模型的优点
         Personalized predictive models offer several advantages for the treatment of pediatric cancer. First, they provide personalized treatment plans that tailor the course of therapy to the individual patient, focusing on genetic differences that are most strongly correlated with survival outcomes. Second, they can save substantial costs by avoiding unnecessary procedures or treatments that would not benefit the patient. Third, they can enhance the quality of care provided to patients by minimizing bias and accounting for subtle heterogeneity in disease progression. Fourth, they can minimize potential side effects or toxicity by carefully selecting medications and administering them only when necessary. Finally, they increase the effectiveness of cancer research by leveraging large datasets to identify disease-related genetic events and their corresponding molecular mechanisms. 
 
 
        # 5.未来发展趋势与挑战
        ## （一）持续迭代的研究和试验
         As outlined above, there are numerous ongoing research efforts dedicated to building personalized predictive models for pediatric cancer. These models can assist physicians in deciding upon the best therapeutic options for each patient based on their unique genetic profile and clinical history, thereby reducing the need for standardized treatment plans. Further, technological advancements in genomics and computing power will continue to enhance the ability of these models to identify key genetic risks and spread the opportunities for discovery and innovation.
         
         Here are some areas where additional research is needed:
         
         1. Developing more advanced computational methods to identify genetic interactions and trends that contribute to cancer. Current research focuses mostly on identifying disease-associated variants that act together in complex ways, but less attention is paid to their subtle consequences. 
         2. Expanding the scope of personalized predictive models beyond breast cancer. Although pediatric cancer shares a lot of similarities with other cancers, it is still a relatively young disease and there exists limited evidence for universal causal relationships across all diseases. Moreover, some traits, such as elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, have been shown to be consistent across the spectrum of cancers, potentially indicating that there are common etiologies underlying breast cancer, but little is known about their role in differentiating cancers in different contexts. A thorough investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of multiple diseases in pediatric cancer would unlock the full potential of personalized predictive models. 
         Additional challenges faced by the field include:
         
         1. Data availability. Currently, there are very few publicly available resources on breast cancer genomics, clinical data, and cohort studies conducted in pediatric settings. This makes it difficult to establish meaningful relationships between cancer and genetics, develop robust statistical models, or test assumptions of causality. 
         2. Complexity of the disease and limited diagnosis tools. As noted earlier, some genetic abnormalities, such as LDH levels, appear to be common across the spectrum of cancers and represent key players in the pathogenesis of different forms of cancer. Without detailed insight into these links, it becomes impossible to develop personalized predictive models that can inform clinical decisions. Furthermore, lack of access to suitable tools for detecting genetic mutations, linking them to their downstream effects, and interpreting their molecular mechanisms can pose a challenge for pediatric cancer research. 

         ## （二）建立数据共享平台
         Evidence suggests that sharing genomic data with external research organizations and companies can accelerate the development of personalized predictive models for pediatric cancer. By pooling resources and collaborating on joint research projects, governments and industry can greatly expand the pool of available genetic data and help expedite the scientific progress of cancer research. 

         Building a data sharing platform for breast cancer research can serve several purposes. First, it can enable researchers from outside the typical medical environment to leverage existing datasets to improve personalized predictive models. Second, it can facilitate collaboration between researchers within the same field and discipline. Third, it can encourage commercial partners to partner with researchers seeking to market personalized medicines. Lastly, increased transparency and accessibility to public data can lower the barrier for entry for researchers interested in solving problems related to pediatric cancer.
