Once converged, we can label each data point according to their assigned centroid and represent them graphically using scatter plots or heatmaps based on two dimensions. We can also visualize the distribution of data points within each cluster using histograms or boxplots. Finally, we can calculate various metrics to assess the quality of our clustering results including the Silhouette Score, Dunn Index, and Elbow Method.
