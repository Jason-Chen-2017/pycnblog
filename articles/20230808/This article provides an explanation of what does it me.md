This article provides an explanation of what does it mean for a matrix to be “nonnegative complete”. It also shows examples of matrices that violate the completeness property and contrasts them with positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices, which are required to satisfy the rank condition. Additionally, we discuss the relation between PCA and nonnegative completion and propose several mathematical tools for analyzing both properties.
