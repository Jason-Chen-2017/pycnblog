In this paper, we explore nonlinear mapping theories that are often employed in understanding the behavior of convolutional neural networks. We start by introducing the concepts of resonance, effective connectivity, filter banks, and pooling layers, which have been found to explain many aspects of CNN performance and architecture design. Our goal is to provide insights into these theories and offer a deeper understanding of CNN structure, function, and training process.
