Our task is to identify the optimal pricing strategy across different markets. For simplicity, letâ€™s assume there are only three products: Product A, B and C. Each product belongs to a specific category like Men, Women, Children etc. Each market has its own demand curve showing the expected sales volume and revenue for each item. Assuming that demand curves vary slightly due to random fluctuations, we want to identify the pricing strategy that yields maximum profit for our target audience.
