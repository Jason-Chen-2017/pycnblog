Next, drag a connection line between the previous transformation component and the Table destination component to indicate that the transformation outputs are consumed by the Table destination. Expand the Table destination node and configure it accordingly depending on the size and complexity of the data being loaded. For example, consider setting batch sizes and disabling identity insert to improve performance when dealing with large amounts of data.
