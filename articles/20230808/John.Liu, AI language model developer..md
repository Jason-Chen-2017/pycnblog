        # 4.1 Basic Concepts

         Before diving deeper into the technical details, let's quickly review basic terms and concepts related to language modeling. Here are some commonly used terms:

         * **Vocabulary**: A set of words and their corresponding probabilities that appear in a given text corpus. For example, if our dataset contains the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", then the vocabulary would contain words such as "the," "quick," "brown," etc., along with their frequencies within the document.

         * **Tokenization**: The process of splitting a string of characters into individual words, phrases, or symbols, which represent meaningful units of text. For example, when tokenizing the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", we get tokens such as "the," "quick," "brown," "fox," "jumps," "over," "the," "lazy," and "dog."

         * **Corpus**: A collection of texts that make up a body of knowledge. For instance, the English Wikipedia consists of several million articles that collectively serve as a corpus of information.

         * **Unigram**: A sequence of one word.

         * **Bigram**: Two consecutive unigrams together form a bigram, while they are separated by a space. For example, in the phrase "I love programming" the bigrams are "I love" and "love programming".

         * **Trigram**: Three consecutive unigrams together form a trigram, while they are separated by two spaces. For example, in the phrase "I love programming" the trigrams are "I love programming".

         * **Language Model:** A statistical model that assigns probability distributions to sequences of words based on frequency counts and n-gram statistics. Based on this probabilistic context, it estimates the likelihood of a sentence occurring in a given text corpus, and predicts the most likely next word in a sequence.

         Now, let's move on to the core topic of language modeling - probability and language modeling.

        # 4.2 Mathematical Foundations

         The foundation of any statistical model is probability theory. Let’s first take a look at what probability means in the context of language modeling. 

         Consider a simple scenario where we want to estimate the probability of a certain event happening, say, whether today will be hot outside. One way to do this is to use conditional probability. We assume that there exists some underlying state that influences the occurrence of the event. For example, suppose that the weather condition affects whether it’s hot outside or not. If it is currently sunny outside, then the chance of tomorrow being hot outside is higher than if it were cloudy. Similarly, if it is currently raining outside, then the chance of rainfall making its way towards the ground before the sun hits the skin may reduce the chances of tomorrows snow being windy. Therefore, we can write the probability of tomorrow being hot outside as:

            P(tomorrow_hot | current_weather) = P(event|state)*P(state)
            P(event|state): Probability of event under particular state.
            P(state): Probability of state itself.

         Given a language model that can assign probabilities to different possible sentences or words, we can use it to calculate the probability of a sentence occurring in a given text corpus. Suppose we are trying to determine the probability of the sentence “Today is a beautiful day” appearing in a large corpus of news headlines. Assuming that our language model has already learned about previous occurrences of similar sentences, we can use it to compute the probability of the sentence directly from the observed word distribution in the corpus. To start, we count the number of times each possible word appears within the sentence and divide them by the total number of unique words in the sentence. Then, we multiply these relative frequencies by their corresponding probabilities assigned by the language model. This gives us a measure of how likely the sentence is to occur in the corpus assuming the language model makes correct predictions. 

         Formally, given a language model M, and a training dataset D, the probability of a sentence X appearing in the corpus is computed as follows:

           P(X) = P(w1^n | M,D)
              w1^n : Sentence consisting of n words
            
           Where w1...wn denotes the nth word of the sentence. Here, M is the language model, and D is the training dataset containing the sentences used to train the language model. 

         Note that although the above equation uses the notation P(X), it does not actually refer to a single probability value. Rather, it represents a computation involving multiple variables and parameters. Specifically, it involves computing the product of probabilities across all possible word combinations of length n, which grows exponentially with n as well as the size of the vocabulary. Nevertheless, since we are interested only in determining the probability of a single sentence, we approximate it by considering only the probability of the nth word according to the language model alone, ignoring all other possibilities. 


         Another important aspect of probability theory relates to Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule allows us to update our prior beliefs based on evidence provided by new observations. For example, suppose we are testing a patient for disease X, but receive positive results indicating that the test detects disease Y instead. Without using Bayes' rule, we might simply conclude that the patient suffers from both diseases without knowing which one caused the symptoms. Using Bayes' rule, however, we can update our prior beliefs as follows:

             P(disease=Y | test=positive) = P(test=positive | disease=Y)*P(disease=Y)/P(test=positive)
                     
               disease=Y: Test indicates disease Y was present
               
               test=positive: Patient received a positive result from the test

       By applying Bayes' rule repeatedly, we can iteratively refine our beliefs until we reach a point where updating no longer improves our confidence level. 
       
       Now that we've covered the basics of probability and Bayes' rule, we can dive deeper into the mathematical foundations of language modeling. 

        # 4.3 Probability & Language Modeling

         When designing a language model, we need to define the structure of the language and learn patterns and features that can help us predict the next word. At a high level, language modeling typically involves the following steps:

         1. Define the Vocabulary: Identify all the possible words that appear in the target domain and construct a dictionary mapping each word to an index. For example, if we want to create a language model for email communication, we could consider a fixed list of common words such as "subject," "body," "date," etc. Each distinct word gets a unique integer ID that serves as its embedding vector representation.

         2. Tokenize Input Text: Convert input text into a series of integers representing the IDs of the constituent words. For example, if we encounter the input text "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", we tokenize it into the four separate words "The," "quick," "brown," "fox," "jumps," "over," "the," and "lazy," with their respective indices. 

         3. Estimate Unigram Frequencies: Count the number of times each unigram appears in the training dataset and normalize them so that they sum to 1. This step helps avoid biased estimates due to short documents or rare words that don't appear enough times. 

         4. Estimate Bigram Frequencies: Count the number of times each bigram (two consecutive unigrams) appears in the training dataset and normalize them so that they sum to 1.

         5. Generate Next Word: Use the language model to predict the most likely next word in a sequence based on previously seen unigrams and bigrams. There are three main approaches to generating the next word:

          * **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE):** Calculate the probability of each possible word occuring in the context of the preceding words using the formula:

                P(wi|w1...wm) = count(wi|w1...wm) / count(w1...wm)

          * **Beam Search:** Choose k most likely candidates for the next word, ranked by their probability, and return the one with the highest probability. Repeat this process recursively until a stopping criterion is met.

          * **Random Sampling:** Randomly select a candidate word from those with the highest probability based on their marginal probability distribution.

         After training the language model, we can evaluate its performance on held out test sets using evaluation metrics such as perplexity, accuracy, recall, and precision. Perplexity measures the average negative log-likelihood of the predicted words compared to the true ones, i.e., lower values indicate better accuracy. 

         Although language modeling is a popular approach for natural language processing tasks, it remains a fundamental challenge due to the enormous amount of training data required. To address this issue, we can leverage transfer learning techniques that allow us to reuse pre-trained language models trained on massive datasets for our target task. This reduces the time and cost involved in training a new language model from scratch.

         Finally, advanced neural network architectures can significantly improve language modeling performance through the ability to capture long-term dependencies between sequential inputs. Examples of effective architectures include recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and transformer networks.

         Overall, language modeling offers an elegant framework for capturing the complexity and uncertainty associated with human language. Despite its powerful theoretical underpinnings, it still requires careful engineering to achieve real-world performance.
