This tutorial demonstrates how to build a facial expression recognition system using OpenCV, Flask, and deep learning. It starts by introducing the basics of face detection using Haar cascades and training a support vector machine classifier to recognize facial expressions. The next step involves integrating the trained model with the web application using Flask, which allows users to interact with the system remotely via a web interface.
