- Use Vectorization Instead of Loops for Performance Gains: Many operations performed on arrays require loops. This slows down our code and makes it less readable. By utilizing vectorization techniques, we can reduce the number of loops required and gain significant performance gains. Vectorization comes in two forms - single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) instructions and thread parallelization. In this article, we'll discuss how to use both approaches effectively in NumPy.
