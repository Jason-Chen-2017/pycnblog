2. Machine learning algorithms applied to named entity recognition: In this post, we discuss several machine learning models that can be trained for named entity recognition task, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks. We also provide insights into how these models work under the hood and evaluate their performance on labeled datasets.
