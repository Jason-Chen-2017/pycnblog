# 1.简介
         

         在深度学习模型训练中，权重参数（Weight parameters）一般采用随机初始化的方法，即将每个神经元连接到的输入加上一个初始值（bias或者叫偏差），然后进行计算，这个过程称之为权重初始化。而偏差项（bias term）则可以使得输出偏离零点，起到非线性的作用。为了使网络更容易收敛，通常会在每层神经元权重与其输入之间加入一个可训练的参数。 
         
         但是对于神经网络的权重参数，一般不直接设置成零或者很小的值。这样做主要是为了避免过拟合现象。过拟合是指神经网络在训练时表现出低效，甚至出现欠拟合。在网络中的权重参数越多、越复杂、越庞大时，模型的训练就越困难，最后导致训练误差越高。也就是说，过于复杂的模型训练起来容易出现过拟合问题，并且很容易出现欠拟合问题。因此，如何正确地选择权重初始化方法非常重要。
         
         本文将对两种权重初始化方法——偏置项初始化（Bias initialization）和Xavier初始化方法作比较研究。通过分析两者各自的优缺点，并结合实际应用场景，本文能够帮助读者更好地理解权重初始化方法的作用及选择。

         ## 2.1 Bias Initialization
         
         In a deep learning model, the bias of each neuron is initialized to some value. The purpose of adding an initial bias value to every neuron in a network is that it can help prevent “dead neurons” or neurons with zero output values during training. A dead neuron means that none of its inputs have any effect on its activation function and therefore contributes nothing to the overall output. This could happen for example if all the inputs are negative values, leading to no change in the weighted sum being calculated by the neuron. Including a small amount of bias helps to break this cycle of never-acting inputs and ensures that the neural network has a meaningful representation of the input data. In other words, bias initialization provides some starting point for the gradient descent process which results in better convergence and faster learning rates when training a deep learning model. 

            For example, let’s say we want to create a neural network with two layers: the input layer with three nodes, the first hidden layer with four nodes, and the second output layer with one node. We will use the sigmoid activation function for both layers except for the last layer where we will use the softmax function. 

            If we initialize the weights randomly using Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.01, then there would be a risk of getting stuck in local minima because the weight updates tend to decrease the loss function and lead to slow convergence. To overcome this issue, we can add an initial bias value to each neuron to make sure that they don’t get stuck at 0 activation. One way to do this is to set the bias parameter equal to a small positive constant value like 0.01.

           Another reason why we need to introduce bias terms is that they enable our networks to learn more complex functions than just linear transformations from their inputs to outputs. Without bias terms, very simple functions such as linear separators might not converge well due to the presence of many flat regions within the decision boundary. Adding bias terms allows these models to find non-linear boundaries between classes and generalize better to new patterns.


            ## 2.2 Xavier Initialization
            Xavier initialization was proposed by Glorot & Bengio at Université de Montreal. It is a recommended method for initializing neural network weights according to the number of incoming connections and the number of outgoing connections. Specifically, Xavier initializes the weights randomly in the range [-sqrt(6/(fan_in+fan_out)), sqrt(6/(fan_in+fan_out))] where fan_in is the number of input units to each neuron and fan_out is the number of output units from each neuron.

            While doing so, Xavier also avoids any symmetry breaking effects caused by setting the limits too low or high. Therefore, Xavier is considered as a good default choice for most applications. One downside of Xavier initialization is that it may require adjustments after some time depending on how many layers the neural network contains and what kind of regularization technique is used. Also, Xavier initialization adds some randomness even if you use fixed seed numbers to initialize your weights. However, the benefits outweigh these drawbacks for most practical purposes.

            ## 3.1 目的
            
            Our goal is to explore and compare different methods of initializing weights in a neural network to address the problem of vanishing gradients and reduce the number of epochs needed to train a deep neural network. This will allow us to select the best approach for our specific application and avoid common pitfalls like underfitting and overfitting.
            
            ### Initializing weights without knowing the scale of input variables
            
            Neural networks often rely heavily on scaling the features before passing them through the network to ensure consistent performance across different ranges of values. When the input variable values vary significantly, the resulting weights in the network can become unbalanced and cause gradients to vanish or explode, making the network unable to effectively learn the task. Scaling the input variables prior to feeding them into the network can solve this problem, but it requires knowledge about the scale of the input variables a priori.
            
            One possible solution to this problem is to use techniques like StandardScaler in scikit-learn library to automatically rescale the input variables to a similar range. Unfortunately, this approach requires us to know the scale of the input variables a priori, which may not always be feasible or desirable.
            
            ### Overcoming vanishing/exploding gradients
            
              VGGNet paper presents several experiments showing that the popular Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture suffers from the vanishing/exploding gradients problems while training. Although various solutions were proposed, including Batch Normalization, Dropout, and Weight Decay, none of them fully addressed the underlying issue. In this work, we propose the use of Leaky ReLU activation function along with Gradient Clipping to improve the stability and efficiency of the CNN during training.
              
              In addition to addressing the vanishing/exploding gradients issues, various other studies have demonstrated that adding noise to the weights during training improves the robustness of the model and reduces overfitting. As mentioned above, increasing the magnitude of the noise during training helps to strengthen the dependence between the network weights and minimize the chances of overfitting.
              
              Despite these advantages, vanilla CNNs still struggle to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on a wide variety of tasks. Several factors contribute to these limitations, including:
              
              - Limited depth and width of the network
              - Heavy use of pooling operations
              - Lack of appropriate normalization schemes
              
            By analyzing the problem of vanishing/exploding gradients, we hope to identify a suitable initialization scheme that addresses this critical challenge. With careful selection of the initialization scheme and hyperparameters, we believe that we can develop a powerful CNN architecture that achieves competitive accuracy on a wide range of tasks.
