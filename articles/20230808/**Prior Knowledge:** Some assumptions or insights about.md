**Prior Knowledge:** Some assumptions or insights about the problem at hand may be useful for obtaining good results. For example, for anomaly detection tasks, one might assume that rare events occur more frequently than common ones. Similarly, when dealing with images, one might know that objects appear in many scales, orientations, colors, positions, etc., so assuming that there exist some underlying regularity within the dataset helps in capturing this information effectively.
