To find the initial centroids, we can use random initialization or use some other technique such as k-means++ which helps speed up convergence. Once the centroids have been initialized, we compute the Euclidean distance between each point and its corresponding centroid and assign each point to the closest centroid until convergence. This means that any data point not assigned during an iteration is likely to be far from all the centroids.
