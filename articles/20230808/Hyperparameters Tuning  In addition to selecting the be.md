6. Hyperparameters Tuning - In addition to selecting the best algorithm, the choice of hyperparameters plays a significant role in improving the performance of the model. These parameters control how the weights of the model are updated during backpropagation and determine the rate of convergence towards the global minimum. Tuning these parameters can be time-consuming but can greatly improve the performance of the model.
