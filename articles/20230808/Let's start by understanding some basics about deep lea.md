Let's start by understanding some basics about deep learning algorithms. According to Wikipedia, "Deep learning" refers to artificial neural networks inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It is capable of processing complex data sets, making predictions on new input data, and achieving state-of-the-art results across many applications. Now let us understand why fast computation is critical in building a deep learning model -
