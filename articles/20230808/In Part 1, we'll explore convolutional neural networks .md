In Part 1, we'll explore convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are widely used in computer vision tasks. We'll examine different activation functions, loss functions, pooling layers, and optimization techniques to train a CNN for classifying images into categories. We'll then evaluate the performance of our model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
