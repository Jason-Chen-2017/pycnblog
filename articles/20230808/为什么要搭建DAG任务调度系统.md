# 1.简介
         
2019年，随着企业数字化转型、海量数据等全新挑战带来的机遇，人工智能技术正在成为企业落地数字化战略中不可或缺的一环。而人工智能自动化决策流程也逐渐成为主流。在这种情况下，自动化调度系统（Workflow Automation System）应运而生。通过自动化流程优化、可视化管理、资源共享、高效执行、精准控制，能够有效提升工作效率并降低成本。当前，开源社区已经有许多优秀的自动化调度系统，如Airflow、Kubeflow、Argo等。DAG即为“有向无环图”（Directed Acyclic Graphic）。它将任务分解成一个个节点，通过边缘连接表示依赖关系，形成一个有序的工作流程，可以实现流程的并行、失败重试、停止继续等任务。
         
         DAG调度系统优点：
         1. 有向无环，简单易懂，便于理解和维护。
         2. 支持多种运行方式，支持复杂的任务依赖。
         3. 支持定时调度、周期性调度、可视化展示等功能。
         
         DAG调度系统使用场景：
         1. 数据处理任务，可用于各类数据分析、机器学习等场景。
         2. 分布式计算任务，任务之间存在依赖关系，需要按顺序进行，比如Hadoop集群上的MapReduce、Spark等。
         3. 系统部署任务，要求按顺序部署。
         4. 爬虫任务，按照优先级、并发度、延迟时间等顺序执行任务。
         
         在现实世界的很多应用场景中，我们都可以使用DAG调度系统来提升我们的工作效率，降低运维成本，更好地进行资源共享和管理。DAG调度系统能够帮助我们解决很多实际的问题，值得我们去研究和尝试。
         
         本文主要阐述了DAG调度系统的相关概念和原理，以及如何基于Apache Airflow框架搭建自己的DAG调度系统。
        
         # 2. 基本概念术语说明
         1. Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):
         
        In computer science and mathematics, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a finite directed graph with no cycles or repeated edges.[1] The name "directed" indicates that the edges have a direction from one node to another; it is called "acyclic" because there are no loops in the graph, i.e., vertices may only be visited once. The concept of a DAG was first introduced by mathematician Edsger Dijkstra,[2][3][4] who used it for problems such as finding paths through networks.
        
        It has been popularized by systems programming languages like Apache Hadoop[5], which use it to represent tasks and data dependencies between them. Other examples include scheduling tasks on cloud computing platforms like Amazon Web Services' Elastic MapReduce or Google's Cloud Dataflow, and building software development tools like Jenkins and Travis CI using DAG workflows.
          
         2. Workflow Automation System:
         
        A workflow automation system is an application or set of applications designed to execute complex processes and automate their execution via a defined sequence of actions, either manually or automatically. They can handle large volumes of data and provide real-time control over the progress and results of each step. Some popular examples include Microsoft SharePoint Server Workflow Manager, IBM's Information Management Automation (IMS), Oracle PeopleSoft Human Resources Decision Support Engine, SAP's Business Warehouse Scheduler, and Talend Open Studio.
          
         3. Tasks:
         
        Task refers to any independent activity or operation performed within a process or workflow. These could range from simple arithmetic operations to complete procedures for generating reports or sending out emails. Each task typically consists of input data, processing steps, and output data. Tasks may depend on other tasks completing successfully before they begin executing, making them interdependent or dependent. For example, if you need to send out a letter after receiving payment from a customer, your mailing list generation task depends on receipt of all payments. 
        
         4. Dependencies:
         
        Dependency refers to the requirement that one task must complete before another task can start executing. This might be due to some requirement of the previous task or simply because one step follows another. If two tasks have a dependency, then the completion time of the first task cannot proceed until the second task completes. Depending on the nature of the work being done, different types of dependencies exist, including sequential dependencies where one task cannot start until the preceding task is completed, parallel dependencies where multiple tasks can run simultaneously without affecting the outcome, and eventual consistency dependencies where the result produced by a task is not immediately available but will eventually become consistent.
        
        In DAG terminology, a dependency means that one task cannot start until all its predecessors have completed. This creates a chain or linear structure amongst the tasks that requires a specific order in which they should be executed. When designing a DAG, we need to ensure that there are no circular dependencies or unreachable nodes, otherwise our overall schedule would not be possible.
