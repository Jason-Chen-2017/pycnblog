 6. "Understanding the Uncertainty in Deep Learning Models": In this post, we discuss the role of uncertainty in deep learning models and how different types of uncertainties affect the performance of various algorithms. We then explore Bayesian inference and propose a unified framework to quantify uncertainty in deep learning models.
