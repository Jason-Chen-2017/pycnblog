15. Distributed Training - Distributed training is an advanced form of parallel processing that enables training large neural networks on multiple machines simultaneously. Each machine works independently and shares their training results to coordinate the overall solution. By splitting up the workload, distributed training can significantly reduce training time compared to single-machine training.
