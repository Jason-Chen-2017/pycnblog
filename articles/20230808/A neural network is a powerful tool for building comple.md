A neural network is a powerful tool for building complex mathematical models from sets of input data. It is composed of layers of interconnected nodes, called neurons, that receive input from other neurons and produce output signals to other neurons. Each neuron takes information from previous neurons, applies weights to it, and passes on the result to subsequent neurons. These connections between neurons allow the model to extract patterns and make predictions about new data inputs.
