12. Principled Data Augmentation - Data augmentation is a technique where images, videos, and speech signals are transformed to create variations that increase the diversity and representativeness of the training set. Without proper data augmentation, the model would be limited to memorizing specific examples and failing to generalize to new situations. Appropriate data augmentation methods must balance variability, creativity, and efficiency to effectively augment the dataset while ensuring quality.
