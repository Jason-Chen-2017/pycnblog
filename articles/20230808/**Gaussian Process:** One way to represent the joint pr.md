**Gaussian Process:** One way to represent the joint probability distribution of inputs X and outputs Y is through a Gaussian process (GP). A GP is defined by two functions â€“ the mean function f(X) that specifies the expected value of the output conditioned on the input values, and the covariance kernel k(x, x') that specifies the degree of dependency between any pair of input points. Given a set of training data {x_i, y_i}, the posterior distribution over the latent variable Z is given by:
