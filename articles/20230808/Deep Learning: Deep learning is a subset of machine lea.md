2. Deep Learning: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves training neural networks with many layers to recognize patterns in complex data. It has become increasingly popular as more complex models have proven capable of understanding and processing high-dimensional data such as images and speech. Other deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and MXNet.
