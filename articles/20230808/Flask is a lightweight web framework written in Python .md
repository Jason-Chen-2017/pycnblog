Flask is a lightweight web framework written in Python that makes it easy to develop web applications. In this article, we will learn how to set up a basic Flask application and deploy a simple machine learning model built with scikit-learn and deployed via Docker containers. Finally, we will test our model using sample input data and discuss best practices for deploying machine learning models in production.
