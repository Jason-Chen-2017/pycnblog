                        If you don't want to receive notifications from private projects or organizations, you can opt out at the project level or organization level. To opt out of notifications from a specific project or organization, go to its repository settings and select "Ignore". This will prevent any future notifications from appearing in your dashboard and notification center. Alternatively, you can also contact the owner of the project or organization to deactivate their notifications.
