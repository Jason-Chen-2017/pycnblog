    K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): K-NN algorithm for classification or regression problems is a non-parametric supervised learning method that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. The main idea behind the K-NN algorithm is to find k-nearest neighbors of a given data point in the training dataset, which are defined as the points whose distances from the query point are minimized.
