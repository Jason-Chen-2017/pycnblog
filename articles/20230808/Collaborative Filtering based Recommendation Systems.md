         Recommender systems are used to predict the preferences of users towards items or products. The algorithms in these systems use information about the user’s behavior and demographics, such as past transactions, ratings, and evaluations of other items, to recommend new items that they may like. Popular recommendation algorithms include matrix factorization methods (MF), neighborhood-based collaborative filtering (NCF), and deep learning models with attention mechanisms. In this article, we will focus on a popular type of recommender system called collaborative filtering, which uses user similarity and item similarity matrices to calculate the predicted preference value for each pair of user and item.

         ### User Similarity Matrix
         A user similarity matrix is a square symmetric matrix where each element represents the degree of similarity between two users. It can be created by using different techniques including cosine similarity, Pearson correlation coefficient, Jaccard coefficient, Euclidean distance and many others. One commonly used technique is to create an NxN matrix, where N is the number of users, where each element i,j indicates how similar the user i is to the user j. There are several ways to compute this similarity measure:

         * Cosine similarity : This approach computes the dot product of the user vectors u_i and u_j divided by their magnitudes. If both vectors have length equal to one, then it becomes identical to Pearson correlation coefficient. 
         * Pearson correlation coefficient : This measures the linear relationship between two datasets. The values range from -1 to 1, where -1 means perfect negative correlation, 0 means no correlation and 1 means perfect positive correlation. It is calculated by dividing the covariance between the two data sets by their standard deviations.
         * Jaccard coefficient : This compares the set of items purchased by the two users and calculates their similarity based on the size of their intersection over their union.
         * Euclidean distance : This measures the straight line distance between the user vectors. The smaller the distance, the more similar the users are. 

         Once the user similarity matrix has been computed, recommendations can be generated for each user by taking into account their similarity to other users. For example, if user A and B are most similar, then it is reasonable to assume that their preferences are also similar. 

         ### Item Similarity Matrix
         An item similarity matrix is a square symmetric matrix where each element represents the degree of similarity between two items. It can be created by using different techniques including cosine similarity, Pearson correlation coefficient, Jaccard coefficient, Euclidean distance and many others. One commonly used technique is to create an MxM matrix, where M is the number of items, where each element i,j indicates how similar the item i is to the item j. There are several ways to compute this similarity measure:

         * Cosine similarity : This approach computes the dot product of the item vectors v_i and v_j divided by their magnitudes. If both vectors have length equal to one, then it becomes identical to Pearson correlation coefficient. 
         * Pearson correlation coefficient : This measures the linear relationship between two datasets. The values range from -1 to 1, where -1 means perfect negative correlation, 0 means no correlation and 1 means perfect positive correlation. It is calculated by dividing the covariance between the two data sets by their standard deviations.
         * Jaccard coefficient : This compares the set of users who interacted with both items and calculates their similarity based on the size of their intersection over their union.
         * Euclidean distance : This measures the straight line distance between the item vectors. The smaller the distance, the more similar the items are. 

         Once the item similarity matrix has been computed, recommendations can be generated for each user by taking into account the preferences of other users for common items. For example, if user A prefers item X but not Y while user B only prefers item Y but not X, then it is reasonable to suggest item Y to user A because they share some interests.

         ## Overview
            * Step 1: Compute user similarity matrix U
            * Step 2: Compute item similarity matrix V
            * Step 3: Calculate the rating prediction score for all possible pairs (u,i) given U and V 
            * Step 4: Sort the list of scores in descending order and select the top K items to recommend to each user

            ## Step 1: Computing User Similarity Matrix
            To compute the user similarity matrix, we first need to generate a feature vector for each user. Then, we can find the closest k neighbors for each user based on the features using any clustering algorithm like k-means, hierarchical, or DBSCAN. We can then assign weights to each neighbor based on their distance metric and finally construct the similarity matrix as follows:

            
            Where m(u,v) denotes the weight assigned to the edge connecting user u to its kth nearest neighbor v.

            ## Step 2: Computing Item Similarity Matrix
            To compute the item similarity matrix, we first need to generate a feature vector for each item. Then, we can find the closest k neighbors for each item based on the features using any clustering algorithm like k-means, hierarchical, or DBSCAN. We can then assign weights to each neighbor based on their distance metric and finally construct the similarity matrix as follows:


            Where n(i,j) denotes the weight assigned to the edge connecting item i to its kth nearest neighbor j.

            ## Step 3: Predicting Rating Scores
            Once we have computed the user and item similarity matrices, we can calculate the expected rating score for all possible pairs (u,i) using the following formula:


            Here r(u,i) denotes the actual rating provided by the user u for item i. If there is no rating available for a particular user and item combination, we can replace it with a default value like zero. 

            Finally, we sort the list of rating predictions in descending order based on their absolute values and return the top K recommended items to each user.
