Applications of SVMs include image recognition, text categorization, spam detection, bioinformatics, pattern recognition, fraud detection, finance, and many others. These applications require handling large amounts of unstructured data, which traditionally has been challenging for traditional machine learning methods. SVMs provide significant improvements over other machine learning techniques in these domains due to their ability to capture complex non-linear relationships among features and targets.
