API stands for Application Programming Interface, and it refers to the way two software programs interact with each other. API design is crucial to building robust and scalable systems, and it can be challenging if you're not experienced with writing code. Building APIs using Python and Flask is much easier than it seems because Flask comes prepackaged with useful features like routing and request handling.
