       ## 一、1. Introduction

       ### 1.1 What is a chatbot? 
       A chatbot or chatterbot is an artificial intelligence (AI) software that conducts conversations via text messaging. The goal of a chatbot is to provide answers to common queries or tasks through conversational interactions with users over the internet or other digital channels. It helps users access information quickly and easily by providing relevant answers and automating frequently performed tasks for them. They can also be trained to perform specific tasks such as making reservations at restaurants, ordering drinks at bars or checking flight status. Furthermore, chatbots are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to handle diverse user needs and increase customer satisfaction levels. However, building a chatbot involves complex algorithms, natural language processing techniques, machine learning models and web development skills. This article will discuss how to build a simple chatbot using natural language processing (NLP). We will first introduce some basic concepts related to chatbot, then explain the approach of building it and finally demonstrate the implementation using NLTK and scikit-learn libraries in python. Finally, we will cover deploying the bot on web or mobile platforms.

      ### 1.2 Why use NLP for building chatbots?
      In recent years, there has been significant progress in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which enables machines to understand human languages like English. With the advancement of deep learning technologies, NLP has become one of the hottest topics in AI research. As a result, various chatbot frameworks have emerged, each designed according to different business objectives and functions. Some of these frameworks employ state-of-the-art neural networks and machine learning algorithms to improve accuracy and response speed. Other frameworks focus more on the narrative flow of conversation and less on keyword matching. Nevertheless, all these approaches involve advanced knowledge of NLP techniques. Therefore, understanding the basics of NLP techniques would help developers create powerful and accurate chatbots.

    ### 1.3 Who should read this book?
    If you are interested in building chatbots, this book is a good starting point. Although the detailed explanations provided in this book might seem daunting at times, they provide clear steps to follow while developing your own chatbot. Anyone with basic programming experience and interest in NLP could benefit from reading this book.

  ### 1.4 Summary
  So far, we have discussed why chatbots are useful and who should read this book. Next, we have explored the basics of NLP and some key terminologies related to chatbots. Then, we have outlined the approach of building a chatbot and demonstrated its implementation using Python's NLTK library. Lastly, we have explained how to deploy the bot on web or mobile platforms.
