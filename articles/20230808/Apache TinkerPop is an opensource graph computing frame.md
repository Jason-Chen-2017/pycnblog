Apache TinkerPop is an open-source graph computing framework built specifically for developing complex graph algorithms. In this article, we will explore how we can automate tasks related to graph database management using Gremlin, one of TinkerPopâ€™s programming APIs. We will see how we can use it to load data into our graph databases, run queries, generate reports, etc., making the process faster, more efficient, and less error-prone.
