A Bayesian approach to handling missing data in multivariate time-series analysis using Gaussian processes - This is a comprehensive guide to Bayesian inference for analyzing time-series data with missing values, including algorithms such as expectation propagation and sparse approximation, as well as tips for selecting appropriate priors. The author also provides examples of real-world scenarios where GPs may work better than standard models.
