# 1.简介
  

Support vector machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised learning algorithm that is capable of performing both classification and regression tasks. The SVM constructs a hyperplane in multidimensional space where the examples from different classes or groups are maximally separated. It is important to note that SVM can only work on linearly separable data sets i.e., it works best when we have clear decision boundaries between two categories. In this article, we will be discussing how support vector machines work in detail along with their implementation through Python using the scikit-learn library. We also provide step by step guidance for building an example model using SVM in Python.<|im_sep|>

    3.总结
    To conclude, this article provides a detailed explanation of what support vector machines are, why they are used, and the underlying mathematics involved. We then implemented these algorithms in Python using the scikit-learn library to build a simple example model. Finally, we discussed some common challenges faced while working with SVMs such as non-linearly separable datasets and kernel tricks. By understanding the key concepts behind SVMs and implementing them successfully, our readers should gain practical experience and knowledge about how to use machine learning techniques effectively for complex problems.
