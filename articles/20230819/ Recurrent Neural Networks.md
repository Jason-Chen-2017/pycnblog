Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a class of artificial neural networks that can process sequences or time series data. The key idea behind RNNs is to use feedback from the previous computations in order to predict the future outputs. They have been shown to perform well on many natural language processing tasks such as speech recognition and sentiment analysis, where sequence information is important. Other applications include music generation, machine translation, and image classification.

In this article, we will explore recurrent neural networks (RNNs) through the lens of deep learning, and learn how they work under the hood. We will also see some of their practical applications in NLP and computer vision, and explore potential uses for them beyond these domains. By the end of this article, you should be able to understand how RNNs function and why they are so effective at solving complex problems in various fields.

This article assumes readers are familiar with basic concepts such as feedforward neural networks, activation functions, loss functions, optimization algorithms, regularization techniques, and training datasets. If not, it's recommended to read our introductory articles before continuing:


# 2. Basic Concepts
## 2.1 Sequential Data
Most real-world sequential data come in different forms, including text, audio, video, weather reports, and medical records. A common characteristic among all types of sequential data is that it exhibits temporal dependency between adjacent elements, which means that each element depends on the previous one. For example, sentences typically depend on words and paragraphs depend on sentences, while stock prices tend to fluctuate over time based on past trends. This property makes sequential data highly suitable for modeling using recurrent neural networks. 

A typical scenario for dealing with sequential data involves splitting it into input and output sequences. Let’s assume that we want to train an RNN to translate English sentences into French. Our input sequence would contain the original sentence in English, and our output sequence would contain the corresponding French sentence. During inference, given an English sentence as input, the model generates the corresponding French sentence by sequentially processing the input sequence and generating output symbols one at a time. 

To make things more concrete, consider the following example:

**Input Sequence**: “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”

**Output Sequence:** “La rapide volpe marron saute par-dessus le chien paresseux ”

During training, the RNN learns to map the input sequence to its corresponding output sequence through a combination of backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent. At test time, when presented with new input sequences, the trained RNN produces correct translations without being explicitly programmed to do so.

## 2.2 Long Short-Term Memory Units (LSTM)
Long short-term memory units (LSTMs) are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) cell that are capable of learning long-term dependencies. LSTMs are particularly useful for handling sequential data because they maintain state information across subsequences, allowing them to learn to recognize patterns and generate predictions accurately even in cases where large gaps exist between individual inputs or outputs.

Each LSTM cell consists of three main components:

1. Input gate: responsible for deciding what information to add to the cell’s hidden state;
2. Output gate: controls which parts of the cell’s hidden state to pass on to the next layer;
3. Forget gate: responsible for controlling which information in the cell’s hidden state to discard.

These components allow LSTMs to keep track of information across arbitrary length sequences, making them a powerful tool for modeling sequential data. 

## 2.3 Gating Mechanisms
Gating mechanisms are a fundamental aspect of the operation of LSTMs. These mechanisms enable LSTMs to control the flow of information through the cell, regulating the way that information is stored and updated within the cell. Gating mechanisms consist of multiple logistic sigmoid units that determine whether certain inputs should be added to or removed from the cell’s internal state, depending on a set of conditions specified by the controller unit.

For example, the input gate determines which values in the input vector should be added to the cell’s hidden state. The forget gate determines which values in the cell’s existing hidden state should be retained or discarded according to the current input and the output of the forget gate itself. Similarly, the output gate determines which parts of the cell’s hidden state should be passed on to the next layer during inference. Overall, gating mechanisms ensure that LSTMs can learn to effectively handle arbitrarily long sequences and preserve the relevant contextual information needed to make accurate predictions. 

# 3. Core Algorithm
An RNN can be thought of as a recurrence equation that operates on a sequence of inputs $x_t$ at a particular time step $t$. At each time step, the RNN receives an input $x_{t}$ along with a learned parameter $\theta$, and applies a non-linear transformation to both the input and the hidden state $h_{t-1}$, resulting in a new hidden state $h_t$. The transformed states are then fed into the same mapping function again, but now with $h_t$ instead of $x_{t}$. This cycle repeats until the entire sequence has been processed.



Here, $W$ and $U$ represent weight matrices applied to the input and hidden state respectively, whereas $b$ represents a bias term. Moreover, $f$, $g$, and $h$ denote activation functions used for calculating the input, forget, and output transformations, respectively. The dot product symbol indicates the pointwise multiplication operator between two vectors. Finally, $[ ]$ denotes the concatenation operator, which concatenates multiple vectors together.

At first glance, the core algorithm may seem opaque and difficult to understand. However, it can be broken down into several simpler steps. Here are some examples of how the RNN works:

1. **Step 1: Cell State Initialization**: When starting a new sequence, the initial cell state $C_0$ must be initialized to zeros. 

2. **Step 2: Forward Pass**: Starting from the beginning of the sequence, the RNN processes each input $x_t$ and computes the hidden state $h_t$ using the formula above. It updates the cell state $C_t$ at each time step by applying the formulas for updating the input gate, forget gate, and output gate, followed by adding the result to the previous cell state multiplied by the forget gate value.

3. **Step 3: Backward Pass**: To calculate gradients for the parameters $\theta$, the RNN performs a backward pass similar to traditional neural networks. Each component of the gradient is calculated using the chain rule, with respect to the total cost $J$, defined as the sum of the cross-entropy losses for each time step $T$:

   $ \frac{\partial J}{\partial W} = \sum\limits_{t=1}^T (\frac{\partial J_t}{\partial C_t}) (\frac{\partial C_t}{\partial W}) + \sum\limits_{t=1}^T (\frac{\partial J_t}{\partial H_t}) (\frac{\partial H_t}{\partial W})$
   
   $ \frac{\partial J}{\partial U} = \sum\limits_{t=1}^T (\frac{\partial J_t}{\partial C_t}) (\frac{\partial C_t}{\partial U}) + \sum\limits_{t=1}^T (\frac{\partial J_t}{\partial H_t}) (\frac{\partial H_t}{\partial U})$
   
   $ \frac{\partial J}{\partial b} = \sum\limits_{t=1}^T (\frac{\partial J_t}{\partial C_t}) (\frac{\partial C_t}{\partial b}) + \sum\limits_{t=1}^T (\frac{\partial J_t}{\partial H_t}) (\frac{\partial H_t}{\partial b})$
   
   where $H_t$ is the output of the nonlinearity $f(C_t)$, and $\frac{\partial J_t}{\partial H_t}$ is the derivative of the loss with respect to the output $y_t$. 
   
   The overall objective is to minimize the cost function $J$ by adjusting the parameters $\theta$ to reduce the error rate. Common optimization methods include stochastic gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent, and momentum.
