# 1.简介
  

Named entity recognition (NER) is a common NLP task that requires recognizing and classifying various types of entities such as people, organizations, locations, etc., in text into predefined categories or clusters. It plays an essential role in information extraction, knowledge representation, data integration, and other NLP applications. In this article, we will cover the basic concepts behind NER and briefly introduce how it works by using Python code examples. We also provide some important references at the end of the article if you want to explore further.

NER refers to the process of identifying and classifying named entities present in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organization names, location names, dates, quantities, etc. The extracted entities can then be used for various natural language processing tasks like machine translation, sentiment analysis, query understanding, document classification, question answering, entity linking, and many more. 

In general, there are two main approaches to perform NER: rule-based and statistical. Rule-based systems use simple rules such as regular expressions or lexicons to identify the most commonly occurring patterns of words within the text. Statistical models learn from large labeled datasets of annotated texts to automatically assign tags to each word in the text based on its context and meaning.

For example, consider the following sentence "Apple Inc. was founded in April 1976 by <NAME>, who sold 1 billion units in Q4". An NER system would need to recognize four different types of entities - "Apple", "Inc.", "April", "<NAME>", "Q4" - along with their respective parts of speech (organization name, date, person name, etc.) before they could classify them into predefined categories. This is what makes NER challenging and exciting! 

Let's dive deeper into the basics of NER and implement our first program using Python! We'll start by learning about the relevant concepts and terminology related to NER, followed by creating our own dataset and training a rule-based model to perform NER. Finally, we'll compare the performance of our rule-based approach against state-of-the-art deep learning methods and evaluate the results of our experiments. If time permits, we may discuss some advanced topics such as fine-tuning hyperparameters and building contextual embeddings to improve accuracy even further.

# 2. Concepts & Terminology
Before diving into coding, let's familiarize ourselves with some core concepts and terminology involved in NER. These include:

1. Tokenization
2. Part-of-speech tagging
3. Named entity labeling
4. Training sets 
5. Test sets 
6. Precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix

## 2.1 Tokenization 
Tokenization refers to the process of splitting a sequence of characters into individual tokens based on specific delimiters or criteria. Tokens can represent either words or subwords depending on the nature of the tokenizer being used. Common tokenizers include whitespace tokenization, character-level tokenization, and morpheme-based tokenization. Whitespace tokenization splits sentences into individual tokens based on whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines). Character-level tokenization treats each character in the input string as a separate token. Morpheme-based tokenization uses morphological analysis to group together words that share similar affixes or suffixes. For instance, "running", "runner", "runs", "runnable" might all be grouped together as one single token representing the verb "run".

## 2.2 Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS Tagging)
Part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging) is the process of assigning a part of speech tag to each token in a given sentence according to its syntactic function. POS tags typically fall into categories such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, conjunctions, interjections, articles, determiners, and numerals. Each token is assigned a unique part of speech tag, which provides valuable insights into the structure and semantics of the sentence. 

Pos tags can be determined using various techniques including heuristics, rule-based algorithms, and probabilistic models. The Stanford Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library has several tools built-in for performing POS tagging, amongst others.

## 2.3 Named Entity Labeling
Named entity labeling involves annotating each token in a sentence with its corresponding named entity type, such as PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, DATE, QUANTITY, etc. During NER, these labels help the downstream NLP tasks to focus only on meaningful chunks of the text and ignore any irrelevant details. Examples of named entities include persons, companies, countries, cities, states/provinces, products, events, etc.  

## 2.4 Training Sets and Test Sets
The training set consists of a collection of annotated texts containing both text and corresponding annotations for named entities. The test set contains a subset of the training set and represents the remaining unseen data that needs to be evaluated after the model has been trained. A good practice is to divide your entire dataset into training and testing sets in a ratio of roughly 80:20 or 70:30, respectively.

## 2.5 Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Confusion Matrix
Precision measures the number of correct positive predictions divided by the total number of positive predictions made. Recall measures the number of true positives divided by the total number of actual positives in the test set. The F1 score combines precision and recall into a single metric by taking their harmonic mean. The confusion matrix displays the frequency distribution of true and false positives and negatives across each category.

# 3. Core Algorithm Overview and Implementation

Now that we have covered the key terms and concepts associated with NER, we can move onto implementing our own algorithm to perform NER. Since there are multiple ways to perform NER, I'm going to showcase my implementation of a simple rule-based system using NLTK.

Our goal is to create a small NER pipeline that takes raw text as input, performs tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity labeling, and outputs the recognized entities along with their corresponding positions in the original text. Here's how it works:

1. Read in a raw text file.
2. Perform tokenization on the text using the nltk `word_tokenize()` method. This returns a list of words.
3. Perform part-of-speech tagging on each word using the NLTK `pos_tag()` method. This returns a tuple consisting of the word and its corresponding pos tag.
4. Create an empty dictionary to store the identified named entities and their corresponding spans in the text.
5. Define a set of named entity types to search for using regular expressions.
6. Iterate through the tagged words and check if they match any of the specified named entity types. If a match is found, add the named entity to the dictionary with its span represented as a slice object (i.e. starting index and ending index). 
7. Return the resulting dictionary containing the recognized named entities and their corresponding spans in the text.

Here's the Python code that implements the above steps:<|im_sep|>
