弱监督目标定位是计算机视觉领域的一个重要方向，在图像中检测、跟踪、识别目标的任务上取得了巨大的成功。众所周知，深度学习方法能够极大地提升目标定位性能。然而，在现实世界中，目标往往并非孤立存在，相互之间会产生交叉甚至重叠。因此，如何充分利用目标之间的联系信息进行定位也是一项关键任务。然而，分类层次结构与实例级表示之间的桥接一直是一个难点。受CNN的启发，本文提出了一个名为CATConv的新型网络，该网络可以充分利用类别级别和实例级特征，通过有效结合它们的空间上下文信息，来更准确地定位目标。在实验结果展示之后，作者还对比了CATConv与其他两种模型，验证其优越性。


## **2** **Background**

### **Object detection and localization**
Object detection and localization are two main tasks in computer vision: detecting objects from a given image or video stream, and locating the precise location of an object with respect to some reference frame. Both tasks can be considered as a weak supervision problem since we don’t have labelled data available for training models directly on them. In fact, many datasets such as PASCAL VOC [7], COCO [8], and ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) [9] provide bounding box annotations which provides us with labeled data required for training deep learning algorithms.


Weakly supervised object localization has gained immense success due to its ability to leverage unstructured information present in images containing multiple objects. In fact, humans can easily locate an object based only on its appearance features like color, shape, texture, etc., but cannot perform this task effectively when dealing with complex scenes that contain overlapping objects. The reason is simple: visual perception involves inferring relationships between different objects from their appearance, spatial arrangement, and semantic meaning, among other factors. 

### **Category level representation vs instance level representation**
To tackle this challenge, there exists a tradeoff between representing objects at different levels of abstraction. On one hand, category-level representations focus solely on identifying the class of each object while ignoring its individual characteristics. On the other hand, instance-level representations capture both the class and the identity of the object by encoding distinct features into a fixed vector space. While these approaches are complementary, they also possess disadvantages compared to fully shared feature vectors. In particular, category-level representations lack fine-grained details about the geometry of an object which could enable more accurate prediction. However, they are easier to learn and require fewer examples for training compared to instance-level representations. To overcome this limitation, researchers have proposed several techniques for bridging the gap between category-level and instance-level representations using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 

In this paper, we propose CATConv, a new model for weakly supervised object localization that combines category-level and instance-level representations using a novel convolution operation called Cross-Attention Convolution (CAC). CAC allows the network to extract high-level semantics by attending to low-level features extracted from both categories and instances. By doing so, it can exploit the relationship between different parts of the same object, resulting in improved accuracy in predicting the target object's boundaries and classification labels. Additionally, CATConv enables multi-task learning wherein the network jointly learns to localize multiple objects simultaneously through cross-attention operations that merge information across classes. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that CATConv achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks including Pascal VOC and MS COCO. 


## **3** **Core concepts and terms**

1. *Instance-level representation*: An instance-level representation encodes all the relevant features of an object into a fixed vector space, capturing both the class and the identity of the object. For example, in a 2D point cloud representation, each point corresponds to an instance and contains attributes such as position, intensity, and color. 

2. *Category-level representation*: A category-level representation ignores the individual characteristics of the object while focusing on the overall class of the object. For example, in an RGB image, pixels corresponding to an object belonging to a certain class are grouped together and denoted by the common color code assigned to that class. This approach simplifies the modeling process by reducing the dimensionality of the input data and speeding up the training process.

3. *Cross-attention mechanism*: The key idea behind CATConv is to use a cross-attention mechanism to fuse information from both category-level and instance-level representations. This mechanism operates on the intermediate layer output of a CNN and computes attention weights between every pair of locations from the original feature map. Then, it applies weighted sums of the values generated by the key and query layers to produce the final fused feature maps. Specifically, the key and query layers correspond to the outputs of separate branches of the network trained to classify the different object types. They both share a single set of weights to compute attention scores between pairs of locations within the same object type. On the contrary, the keys of different object types are associated with unique sets of weights computed by a second branch of the network. The advantage of this mechanism lies in its ability to combine diverse information sources while preserving the representational power of each representation separately.

4. *Feature fusion module*: The role of the feature fusion module is to adaptively select which combination of category-level and instance-level representations to use during the forward pass. It does so by computing a cost function that measures the similarity between the predicted object boundary and the ground truth annotation, accounting for various geometric errors and scale variations introduced by scaling transformations and occlusion. Based on this measure, the module selects either category-level or instance-level representations depending on whether the predicted boundaries match well with the annotated ones.

## **4** **Algorithm**



1. We first obtain a set of candidate objects in an input image. Each candidate object must meet our predefined criteria for being an interesting object to recognize, such as size and aspect ratio. We then apply a region proposal algorithm to generate initial regions of interest around the candidates, which will serve as anchors for the next step.
2. Next, we feed the cropped regions to a backbone CNN architecture to extract features for each anchor. These features will act as inputs to the following processing steps.
3. First, we pass the features obtained above through a cross-attention module that generates a final set of fused features that take into account both category-level and instance-level contexts. The key and value layers correspond to the output activations of separate branches of the network, respectively, responsible for extracting category-level and instance-level features, respectively. 
4. Second, we feed the fused features to another series of dense blocks followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation functions. These layers transform the input features into higher-dimensional representations that can be used for classification or regression. Finally, we obtain a softmax probability distribution over K possible object categories and their respective bounding boxes for each anchor.

## **5** **Details of implementation**

CATConv uses a novel convolution operator called “cross-attention convolution” (CAC) that takes advantage of both category-level and instance-level representations. The key idea here is to use a cross-attention mechanism to align features between the categories and instances of the object, allowing the network to efficiently explore the contextual relationships between the elements composing the same object. The basic idea of CAC is similar to self-attention in NLP, but applied to three-dimensional spatial dimensions instead of sequences. Specifically, CAC performs the following steps:

1. Compute attention weights using the dot product between the query tensor Q and the key tensor K, scaled by their dimensionality. Let $\alpha_{ij}$ be the attention weight between the i-th channel of the query tensor Q and the j-th channel of the key tensor K. 

2. Apply softmax function to normalize the attention weights, obtaining the attention probabilities $p_{ij}$.

3. Multiply the values tensor V by the attention probabilities and sum them along the channels axis, producing the fused features $\hat{V}_{i}$, which replace the conventional value matrix V.

4. Additionaly, we concatenate the fused features with the original input features to preserve the residual information contributed by non-fused components of the model.

Overall, CATConv exploits both the strengths of category-level and instance-level representations by introducing a hybrid embedding technique that integrates information from both modalities and further improves the predictions by considering the interdependencies between the different constituents of an object. Empirical results show that CATConv significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.
