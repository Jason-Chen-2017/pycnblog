Tokenization is one of the key tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It refers to splitting a text into small parts called tokens based on certain rules or patterns. The resulting collection of tokens is often used for further processing such as machine learning applications like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition etc., where each token can be assigned with some meaningful representation. 

In this article, we will understand what is tokenization and why it is important? We will also see different components involved in tokenization and how they work together to produce the final set of tokens. Finally, we will discuss several techniques and algorithms that are widely used in NLP for tokenization, including whitespace tokenizer, character-level tokenizer, word-level tokenizer, sentence-level tokenizer, and subword-based tokenizer.

This article assumes that the reader has basic knowledge of natural language processing concepts such as lexicon, corpus, vocabulary, n-gram, stemming, stop words, part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, semantic role labeling, discourse analysis, dependency parsing, and other relevant fields. 

Before starting with tokenization, let's get familiarized with the various terms used in this article. Here is an explanation of these terms - 

1. **Lexicon**: A list of words along with their meanings which defines the grammar rules of a language.
2. **Corpus**: A large collection of texts in a given language.
3. **Vocabulary**: The complete set of all possible words in the corpus.
4. **n-gram**: An ordered sequence of n words taken from a sample of text. For example, if n=3, then "the quick brown fox" would become "the", "quick", "brown", "fox".
5. **Stemming**: Process of reducing words to their base/root form without losing significant meaning or context. Common methods include Porter Stemmer and Snowball Stemmer. 
6. **Stop words**: Words that are commonly occurring but have no significant meaning, such as "a", "an", "the", "in", "on", "at". They can usually be removed while doing text preprocessing steps.
7. **Part-of-speech (POS) Tagging**: Assigning appropriate tags to each word depending upon its function, usage, and grammatical role within the sentence.
8. **Syntactic Parsing**: Analysis of the linguistic structure of sentences by identifying the relationships between constituent elements such as subject, verb, object, preposition, adverb, conjunction etc.
9. **Semantic Role Labeling**: Identifying the purpose or role of every word in a sentence using machine learning models trained on labeled data.
10. **Discourse Analysis**: Structuring and analyzing the flow of ideas, thoughts, and arguments within a larger conversation.
11. **Dependency Parsing**: Analyzing the grammatical dependencies between pairs of words within a sentence. These dependencies help us identify the subjects and objects of a sentence and make predictions about the relationship between them.


Let’s now move towards defining the concept and components of tokenization. 

# 2.Basic Concepts & Terms

## What Is Tokenization?

Tokenization means breaking down a piece of text into smaller parts, or known as “tokens”. This process helps in understanding the underlying meaning behind the text and extracting useful information. In simple words, it converts raw text data into a format that can be easily processed and analyzed. Tokens can be defined as any element comprising a discrete unit of language – typically a word or punctuation mark. 

The output of tokenization process depends on the following factors : 
* Text size: Large text sizes may need more computational resources to tokenize accurately. Additionally, there might not always be enough memory available to store the entire document after tokenization. Hence, chunking up the text into smaller segments before tokenizing improves efficiency. 
* Language complexity: Depending on the language being used, different tokenization strategies may be followed. Some languages may require special handling compared to others. However, even for well-defined languages, there exist variations in tokenization behavior. 
* Domain-specific requirements: Tokenization strategies vary across domains such as legal documents, social media posts, e-mail messages, programming code snippets, or scientific literature. Each domain requires specific tokenization considerations. 

Once we break down a sentence into individual words or phrases, we need to assign them meaningful representations so that they can be understood by our machines. These representations are called tokens. There are two types of tokens: 

1. Whitespace-delimited tokens: This type of token uses spaces, tabs, newlines, carriage returns, etc. to split the text into chunks. Examples of whitespace delimited tokens include plain text, HTML, XML, JSON files. 

2. Character-delimited tokens: This type of token uses characters themselves to create tokens. Examples of character-delimited tokens include binary data formats like images, audio clips, videos, PDF documents.  

When dealing with text data, the choice of whether to use a whitespace or character-delimited tokenizer becomes critical. While whitespace delimiters offer greater flexibility and portability, character delimiters allow for more precise control over the way the text is broken into tokens. Both approaches involve treating whitespace characters differently than other non-whitespace characters when breaking text into tokens. 

## Tokenization Components

There are three main components involved in tokenization: 

1. Lexicon: A lexicon contains a list of words along with their meanings which defines the grammar rules of a language. Based on this lexicon, we can define the boundary points between words and determine the next valid position for a delimiter. 

2. Corpus: A corpus is a large collection of texts in a given language. The corpus is required for building the lexicon by collecting sufficient amounts of text data containing both training and testing data. Without a robust corpus, the accuracy of tokenization algorithms cannot be guaranteed.  

3. Vocabulary: The vocabulary consists of all possible words in the corpus. To build a vocabulary, we first collect a large number of documents and extract out only those unique words. The vocabulary helps in determining the largest possible number of distinct tokens that can appear in the input text. 


After creating the vocabulary, we move onto the actual tokenization task. There are four major classes of tokenizers based on their granularity levels: 

1. Whitespace Tokenizer: This class of tokenizer splits the input text into tokens based solely on white space characters. This approach works fine for most cases, but may fail in some edge cases such as long URLs or email addresses embedded inside the text. Whitespace-delimited tokens are easy to handle since they already come with default spacing markers. 

2. Character-Level Tokenizer: This class of tokenizer breaks the input text into tokens at the level of individual characters. This approach allows for more control over the token boundaries but comes with higher computation costs due to the additional overhead of managing individual characters instead of whole words. Character-delimited tokens provide more granular insights into the underlying textual structure and enable better modeling of complex linguistic phenomena. 

3. Word-Level Tokenizer: This class of tokenizer splits the input text into tokens at the level of individual words. It involves dividing the text into words and taking care of proper nouns and contractions. This approach produces consistent results across different contexts, making it ideal for tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER), Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS), and Machine Translation. 

4. Sentence-Level Tokenizer: This class of tokenizer splits the input text into individual sentences. Different sentence-level tokenizers can employ different heuristics for separating paragraphs, chapters, and sections, leading to slightly different segmented outputs. This technique enables specialized tasks such as Discourse Analysis or Sentiment Analysis.


Finally, we look at popular subword-based tokenizers. Subword-based tokenization techniques use a hybrid approach combining letters and symbols to represent words. This technique aims to capture the commonality among related words, thus reducing the overall dimensionality of the vocabulary. Popular subword-based tokenizers include Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), WordPiece, GPT-2, and Elmo.
