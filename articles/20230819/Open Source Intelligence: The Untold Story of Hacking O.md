This includes identifying active domains, IP addresses, employee names, and other relevant information. Typically, these activities involve visiting website directories, checking search engine rankings, and reviewing data leaks posted on dark web markets.

2.1.8 Social Engineering: Social engineering involves manipulating people into revealing confidential information, usually through emails, phone calls, or text messages. For instance, employees might be asked to provide bank account information or credit card details during an employment interview. Also, a targeted marketing strategy might seek out highly connected individuals within a company to exploit them for profit.

2.1.9 Threat Intel Gathering: Threat intel gathering involves collecting information about threat actors or specific industries, such as financial services companies or government agencies. This type of intelligence can help inform decision-making processes, secure critical infrastructure, and protect against future threats. While it is essential for businesses to continuously monitor threats, attackers frequently abuse this capability to game detection algorithms and lead to massive losses.

2.1.10 Public Disclosures: Public disclosures refer to the sharing of data through official channels, such as reports released by governments, corporations, or international agencies. This includes press releases, news articles, and disclosure documents. The goal of public disclosures is to communicate threats, risks, and opportunities that may arise to stakeholders. However, certain companies and organizations may fear legal liability if they fail to properly protect themselves against threats, so there needs to be careful monitoring and oversight.

2.1.11 Malware Analysis: Malware analysis involves understanding the structure and functionality of malicious code, identifying potential weaknesses, and creating countermeasures to prevent the malware from executing harmful actions. Many security experts recommend that analysts thoroughly inspect malware samples to avoid false positives, ensuring that all security measures have been implemented correctly.
