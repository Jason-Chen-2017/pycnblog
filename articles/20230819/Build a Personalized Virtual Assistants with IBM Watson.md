> AI Personalization (AI Personalization) is the process of providing different personalized experiences to users based on their unique preferences or behaviors. Virtual assistants and chatbots have become an integral part of modern communication systems because they can provide customized answers or services in real-time according to user needs and interests. However, building such intelligent virtual assistants requires expertise in natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and deep neural networks (DNN). The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how you can build your own personalized virtual assistant using IBM Watson’s cloud-based platform for developing artificial intelligence applications.

In this article, we will use Watson Assistant as our example application to develop a personalized virtual assistant that can answer specific questions about movies, music, TV shows, books, etc., depending on the user's preferences and behavioral traits. We will also integrate various API calls from third-party providers like OMDB and Genius to enhance the accuracy and relevance of our responses. Finally, we will share some best practices to improve the quality and usability of our virtual assistant app. 

This article assumes readers are familiar with basic concepts of NLP, ML, and DNN. Also, it is recommended that the reader has a strong understanding of web development languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, etc., to enable integration of APIs and UI components into our virtual assistant app. Furthermore, knowledge of IBM Cloud platform, data analytics tools, and other related technologies would be beneficial.

## 2.1 概念
Personalization refers to the adaptation of products or services to meet individual user preferences and goals. In general, personalization involves creating different versions or variations of products or services tailored to a particular group or audience. Personalization typically includes recommending items, personalizing content, adjusting prices, delivering targeted offers, and suggesting personalized search queries. This type of design approach helps companies achieve greater engagement, conversion rates, and overall customer satisfaction.

## 2.2 术语
### Natural Language Processing (NLP): 
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, mainly through the usage of natural language. It enables machines to understand, analyze, generate, and manipulate human language effectively. NLP involves several techniques like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, topic modeling, text classification, speech recognition, and machine translation.

### Machine Learning (ML): 
Machine learning (ML) is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical algorithms to learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed. Its goal is to teach itself by analyzing and interpreting data rather than being explicitly programmed. Some popular examples of machine learning include image recognition, text classification, voice recognition, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and forecasting.

### Deep Neural Network (DNN): 
A deep neural network (DNN) is a class of machine learning models inspired by the structure and function of the brains of animals and insects. A DNN consists of multiple layers of connected neurons. Each layer receives input from the previous layer, processes it, and passes its output to the next layer. The final output of the model is determined by the weighted sum of the outputs from each layer. DNNs are widely used in fields like computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI): 
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science and mathematics concerned with enabling machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. Examples of common AI tasks include playing chess, recognizing objects in photos, and making medical diagnoses. There are many subfields of AI including knowledge representation, reasoning, perception, planning, robotics, and control.

### Conversational Agents: 
Conversational agents refer to automated software programs that mimic human conversation and interaction. They work by taking input from a user, identifying what kind of intent it wants to convey, and generating appropriate output based on its context and past conversations. Chatbot platforms like Dialogflow, Microsoft Bot Framework, and Amazon Lex provide tools for building conversational agents quickly and easily. These bots can interface with humans via social media, websites, and messaging apps to provide instant access to valuable information, make purchases, request support, or manage healthcare procedures.

### IBM Watson Assistant: 
IBM Watson Assistant is a cloud-based natural language understanding service that provides a set of features for building conversational interfaces for developers. With the IBM Watson Assistant API, developers can create dialog flows and integrations with third-party APIs, add skills, train the agent, test it, deploy it, and monitor its performance over time. Developers can choose from prebuilt templates or create custom ones based on their domain of expertise. Additionally, Watson Assistant comes integrated with several data sources such as weather, news, and finance to enrich user experience and increase engagement levels.
