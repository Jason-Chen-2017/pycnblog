# 1.简介
  

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a crucial part of natural language processing that helps to extract entities such as names of persons, organizations, locations, and dates from unstructured text data. It becomes even more important with the increasing use of social media platforms where people post their content without proper labeling or structure. The need for automation tools like NER has become more critical than ever before. 

There are several libraries available out there for performing NER tasks in Python but some require some basic programming skills. Therefore, this article provides an introduction to NER using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), which can be easily integrated into any Python project. In addition to this, we will also discuss how to train your own models to improve accuracy by leveraging annotated datasets. We will also briefly touch upon some advanced concepts related to deep learning-based NER systems. Finally, I hope this article will help you get started with working on NER projects in Python. Let's dive right into it!

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before going ahead with the actual tutorial, let us understand some of the key concepts associated with named entity recognition system.

1. Tokenization: This process involves splitting the input text into smaller units called tokens based on space or punctuation marks. 

2. Part-of-speech tagging: Once the tokens have been identified, they must be categorized according to their parts of speech i.e., nouns, verbs, adjectives etc. This step is essential because certain words belong to different classes under different circumstances. For example, "play" might refer to verb or sports term whereas "game" would be referring to video game. Hence, identifying these kinds of features allows for better classification. NLTK library comes equipped with a POS tagger called NLTK Tagger. However, note that it may not perform well on complex sentences or longer texts as it relies heavily on dictionaries for tagging each word correctly. There exist other state-of-the-art libraries such as Stanford CoreNLP for sentence segmentation and pos-tagging, spaCy for handling complex sentences and multi-lingual documents, OpenIE for extracting relations between terms, etc.

3. Named Entity Recognition (NER): Here, the task is to identify various types of entities present within the given text. These could include person names, organization names, location names, date/time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, currencies, and so on. NER can be further classified into two categories - Rule-Based and Statistical Approaches. In rule-based approach, a set of rules is developed to match entities based on their lexical patterns and contextual clues. On the other hand, statistical approaches make use of machine learning algorithms to learn patterns from labeled training data and classify new examples automatically. Both rule-based and statistical methods produce accurate results but rule-based methods tend to work well only on small scale problems while statistical ones can handle larger volumes of data and provide better performance metrics.

4. Annotated Datasets: This consists of pre-annotated data containing both tokenized and tagged text along with the corresponding entity type for each word or phrase. This dataset is used to train and evaluate the performance of the model during the training phase.

5. Corpus: This refers to all the text documents collected together to formulate the overall corpus.

Let me know if you have any queries regarding these definitions?

# 3. Deep Learning Approach
Deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly effective in capturing semantic relationships between words in a document. They learn abstract representations of words by analyzing its surrounding context. DNNs can take advantage of this fact and capture more meaningful insights about the entire document at once. As a result, they offer considerable advantages over traditional machine learning techniques like logistic regression or decision trees when dealing with large volumes of data. To build a deep learning-based NER system, we need three components - a tokenizer, a part-of-speech tagger, and a sequence classifier.

1. Tokenizer: This component splits the input text into individual words or phrases depending on the nature of the problem. Some common techniques used in NLP involve regular expression matching, stemming, lemmatization, and n-grams. NLTK provides support for most of these techniques through its WordPunctTokenizer module.

2. Part-of-speech Tagging: Once the input text has been tokenized, it needs to be categorized based on its parts of speech. Part-of-speech tagging is typically done using either a manual tag dictionary or a machine learning algorithm trained on a labeled dataset. NLTK provides support for both of these techniques through its PerceptronTagger module. Additionally, some more recent papers suggest incorporating syntactic information into the POS tagging procedure to obtain improved accuracy.

3. Sequence Classifier: Now that we have extracted relevant features from our input text, we need to convert them into numerical vectors that can be fed into a DNN architecture. One popular choice is to utilize bi-directional LSTM networks known as Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks (BiLSTM). BiLSTMs are capable of capturing long-term dependencies in sequences and capture the sequential nature of language due to their ability to propagate forward and backward information throughout the network. The output of the BiLSTM layer is passed through fully connected layers to predict the appropriate entity type for each word or phrase.

Overall, building a deep learning-based NER system requires diverse expertise in natural language processing, computer science, and deep learning. By integrating multiple techniques, we can develop robust and accurate systems that can recognize and classify a wide range of entities in unstructured text data.
