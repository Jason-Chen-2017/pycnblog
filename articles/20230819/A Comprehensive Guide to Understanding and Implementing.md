Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), also known as ConvNets or Deep Learning, are powerful machine learning algorithms used for image classification tasks. In this article, we will cover the basics of CNNs architecture, terminology, and code implementation using a popular deep learning framework called TensorFlow. 

This guide aims at providing an accessible yet comprehensive introduction to CNNs for beginners with knowledge on basic machine learning concepts like activation functions, loss functions, forward propagation, backward propagation, pooling layers, regularization techniques, and hyperparameters tuning.

To understand why and how these concepts are essential for building strong models that can recognize complex patterns from images, let's consider the following example: We want our model to classify between two objects: one is a red apple, and another is an orange juicy fruit. The input features would be pixel values of each object, which can range from 0-255 for grayscale pixels and 0-1 for color pixels. 

Without any prior knowledge about the underlying pattern or structure of the data, how could a computer learn to recognize this object? One possible approach would be to use a neural network where each neuron learns some features from the raw data by performing convolution operations across different subsets of the image. These learned features capture important visual information such as edges, corners, etc., that help discriminate between the two objects.

In this blog post, I will demonstrate step-by-step how to build a simple CNN using TensorFlow to identify both apples and orange fruits based on their color spectrums and textures. Finally, we will explore other applications of CNNs such as object detection, segmentation, and facial recognition.


# 2.CNN Architecture
Let’s start by understanding what a traditional feedforward neural network looks like and how it cannot perform well when dealing with complex datasets with multiple features or inputs. Here is the overall architecture of a standard feedforward neural network:


As you can see, the feedforward NN consists of fully connected layers (hidden layers) followed by output layer(s). Each hidden layer receives input from all previous layers and computes an output by passing its own weights and biases through a non-linear function. The final output is then computed using the output layer, which applies a softmax function over the outputs of the last hidden layer. 

The key issue with standard feedforward networks is that they struggle when the number of input features becomes large or the dataset has high dimensionality. This happens because there are too many parameters to train and the gradient descent optimization algorithm may become unstable. To address this problem, the authors of AlexNet proposed the idea of using convolutional layers instead of fully connected layers. Here is the general architecture of a typical CNN:


Similar to the traditional neural network, each node in a CNN performs a convolution operation on the input feature maps and passes them through a non-linearity function such as ReLU or sigmoid. There are typically more than one convolutional layer in a CNN to extract increasingly complex features from the original input. After several convolutional layers, the spatial dimensions of the input reduce due to the pooling layers, allowing the network to focus on the most relevant parts of the image. Then, the pooled feature maps are fed into the fully connected layers to produce the final output predictions.

In addition to convolutional and pooling layers, there are additional layers such as normalization and dropout layers that are commonly added after every set of convolutional and pooling layers. Normalization layers ensure that the network is able to handle variations in the input features and helps avoid vanishing gradients during training. Dropout layers randomly deactivate nodes during training to prevent co-adaptation of nodes and reduce overfitting. 

Now that we have a clear understanding of the basic concepts behind CNNs, let’s dive deeper into the technical details of implementing them using TensorFlow.
