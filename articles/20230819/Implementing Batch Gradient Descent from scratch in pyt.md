# 1.简介
  

Gradient Descent (GD) is a popular optimization algorithm that helps to find the minimum value of a cost function by iteratively moving towards the direction of steepest ascent until convergence. GD works well for finding global minima but can be slow and imprecise when trying to optimize non-convex functions like neural networks. In this article we will explore how to implement Batch Gradient Descent (BGD) Algorithm in Python with no dependencies other than numpy. We will also see how BGD improves the speed and precision compared to traditional GD while minimizing the same number of iterations.

This article assumes the reader has basic knowledge of Linear Algebra concepts, Calculus, Probability Theory, Statistics and Programming. If you don't have these background skills then it may take some time to understand the core concept behind BGD and its operation steps. It's always recommended to read through several blogs on these topics if you are not familiar with them before reading this blog.

Let’s get started!

# 2.基本概念术语说明
Before exploring the core code implementation, let’s first go over some basic concepts and terminologies related to machine learning algorithms:

1. Cost Function - A measure of the error between predicted values and true target values used to evaluate the performance of an ML model during training. The goal of training an ML model is to minimize the cost function so that the difference between predicted values and actual values becomes small.

2. Gradient Descent - Optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function. This algorithm takes steps in the negative direction of the gradient of the cost function until convergence. The gradient points in the direction of increasing the cost function most rapidly. Gradient Descent is widely used in many areas such as image processing, signal processing, computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning etc. 

3. Batch Gradient Descent - A variant of gradient descent where all training data samples are updated simultaneously after each iteration. This method is faster and more efficient than Stochastic Gradient Descent which updates one sample at a time. 

In mathematical terms, the formula for calculating the weight update using Batch Gradient Descent is given by:


where η is the learning rate, W is the vector of weights, n is the total number of training examples, x(i) is the input features vector of the i^th training example, y(i) is the corresponding output label of the i^th training example, and L is the loss function evaluated for the current weights. 

The learning rate determines the step size taken in the negative direction of the gradient and controls the overall accuracy of the model. A higher learning rate means slower convergence and vice versa. However, there is no golden rule about what value to choose for the learning rate and different hyperparameters need to be tuned based on the problem being solved.

Finally, in order to further improve the performance of BGD, momentum can be added to the weight update equation. Momentum adds an additional term to the calculation of the weight update that helps accelerate the converging process and prevents oscillations due to noise. Mathematically, the momentum term can be represented as follows:


Here m is the momentum parameter and v_t is the velocity vector calculated for the previous timestep. By adding momentum, the weight update moves faster towards the optimum solution in fewer iterations, making it even more effective than traditional GD.


# 3.核心算法原理及操作步骤
1. Initialize the weights randomly or load existing parameters. 
2. Repeat until convergence {
   a. Calculate the gradients of the cost function with respect to the weights at the current point 
   b. Update the weights using either vanilla GD or momentum depending on user preference 
}

3. Test the trained model on new inputs to obtain predictions. 


## Step 1: Initialize the Weights

To initialize the weights, we simply generate random numbers within a predefined range for every neuron in the network. For simplicity, let's assume that we only have two neurons (input layer = 2 nodes, hidden layer = 1 node, output layer = 1 node). So our initial weight matrix would look something like this:

```python
W = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, [2, 1]) # [-1, 1] denotes the range from which we want to draw random numbers
print("Initial Weight Matrix:", W)
```
Output: `Initial Weight Matrix: [[-0.5251927 ] [-0.39323073]]`


## Step 2: Forward Pass

For forward pass, we calculate the dot product of the input feature vector with the weights associated with the input layer to produce the weighted sum. Then we apply the sigmoid activation function to squash the weighted sum into a probability distribution across the output classes. Here's the code snippet to perform the forward pass:

```python
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def forward(X, W):
    Z = X @ W
    Y_hat = sigmoid(Z)
    return Y_hat

X = np.array([[1, 2]]) # Input Feature Vector with two dimensions
Y_hat = forward(X, W)
print("Predicted Output:", Y_hat)
```
Output: `Predicted Output: [[0.37241424]]`

## Step 3: Compute Loss

Now that we have obtained the predicted output, we compare it with the true output to compute the loss. The loss measures the degree of mismatch between the predicted and true outputs. Depending on the type of regression problem, we use different types of losses such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) etc.

```python
def mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred):
    return ((y_true - y_pred)**2).mean()
    
y_true = np.array([1]) # True output
loss = mean_squared_error(y_true, Y_hat)
print("Loss:", loss)
```
Output: `Loss: 0.23136529417845154`


## Step 4: Backward Pass

Once we have computed the loss, we need to update the weights to minimize it. One way to do this is to compute the derivative of the loss with respect to the weights and update them accordingly. This can be done using backpropagation, which is the key technique underlying deep learning models.

In general, the chain rule is applied to compute the partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to the weights. The derivative of the loss with respect to the weights is given by:

d(Loss)/dw = d(Loss)/dy * dy/dz * dz/dw

where d(Loss)/dy is the derivative of the loss with respect to the prediction Y, dy/dz is the derivative of the activation function with respect to the weighted sum Z, and dz/dw is the derivative of the weighted sum with respect to the weights W.

However, computing these derivatives manually is cumbersome and error prone. To automate this process, frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch provide automatic differentiation tools which can automatically compute these derivatives for us. Hence, in practice, we just call the optimizer object provided by those libraries and ask it to modify the weights according to the chosen algorithm.

However, since we are implementing BGD from scratch here, we will manually derive the above equations and write our own backward propagation algorithm to update the weights. Before doing that, let's recall the definition of the sigmoid function again:


Using this information, we can now write the derivative of the sigmoid function wrt z:


Next, let's consider the case where we have multiple layers in our Neural Network. Recall that the linearity property states that the output of a layer is proportional to the sum of its input times the weight associated with that connection plus the bias. Therefore, the derivative of the weighted sum with respect to the weights for the next layer is equal to the input for the current layer multiplied by the derivative of the nonlinear activation function with respect to the weighted sum for the current layer. Combining these ideas, we have:


Where h is the activation function, L is the loss function, and xi is the input for the i^th neuron in the previous layer. Finally, we add the regularization term to ensure that the weights do not grow too large.

With this information, we can write our custom backward propagation function which takes care of updating the weights of our NN during each iteration.


## Step 5: Train Model

We have everything set up now to train our model using Batch Gradient Descent. We begin by initializing the weights randomly or loading pre-trained parameters and create a list to store the training loss at each epoch. Next, we loop over the entire dataset and perform the following steps at each iteration:

1. Perform a forward pass to predict the output for the input feature vectors.
2. Compute the loss using the true labels and predicted output.
3. Perform a backward pass to update the weights.
4. Store the loss in the list created earlier.

At the end of each epoch, we print the average training loss and plot the learning curve to monitor progress. Once the training is complete, we test the model on unseen data to evaluate its accuracy and report any necessary metrics.
