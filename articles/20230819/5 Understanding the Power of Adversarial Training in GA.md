Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a powerful framework for learning complex data distributions. However, they have also faced several issues such as mode collapse and limited sample efficiency that limit their performance. To address these challenges, various techniques have been proposed to improve GAN training such as weight clipping, label smoothing, KL-divergence regularization, etc. In this blog post, we will discuss one particular technique called Adversarial Training which is widely used to train GANs. We will start by introducing the problem of GAN overfitting, followed by the basic concepts of Adversarial Training and its implementation in GANs. Finally, we will analyze how adversarial training can help reduce mode collapse and improve sample efficiency. This article should be helpful for researchers, engineers, and practitioners who are interested in understanding and applying state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to solve problems in computer vision, natural language processing, audio processing, and other domains where GANs are commonly used.

Adversarial Training is a class of techniques that has been used with GANs since at least 2014. It was introduced as an alternative to traditional maximum likelihood or backpropagation optimization methods in the context of GANs during the development of image synthesis models. The general idea behind Adversarial Training is to make use of two neural networks: Generator network and Discriminator network. The generator network learns to generate samples from random noise vectors while the discriminator network tries to distinguish between generated and real images. During Adversarial Training, both networks simultaneously learn to compete against each other. By doing so, the discriminator network becomes more robust and improves the quality of generated samples. While conventional GAN training relies on fixed hyperparameters like the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate, Adversarial Training uses continuously updated parameters through gradient descent updates to converge towards better solutions. This approach not only makes it easier to optimize but also leads to faster convergence rates when compared to standard GAN training approaches. Overall, Adversarial Training is a highly effective way to enhance GAN training capabilities and is currently being applied in many applications ranging from image generation to video synthesis to music synthesis. Nevertheless, there are still some open questions around its effectiveness, especially in handling high-dimensional input spaces and improving the stability of the model during training.

In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have become popular due to their ability to generate photorealistic images, videos, and texts without any supervision. Despite their success, they have also faced several issues related to overfitting, poor sample diversity, slow convergence, and limited representational capacity. One common issue with GANs is overfitting, where the generator starts generating samples that don’t resemble the distribution of the training data and thus lead to poor sample quality. Additionally, GANs often suffer from mode collapse, where the generator begins producing similar samples repeatedly. Another major challenge with GANs is lack of efficient sampling, which means that trained GANs may struggle to produce diverse samples even if given infinite data. 

To address these issues, various techniques have been proposed such as Weight Clipping, Label Smoothing, Kullback-Leibler Divergence Regularization, and others, which attempt to improve the training process of GANs. These techniques involve adding additional constraints to the objective function of the discriminator network or using regularizers that penalize the distance between real and fake images, respectively. Although these techniques do help in reducing the chances of overfitting, they still require careful tuning of hyperparameters, which limits their scalability and applicability. Thus, another area of research that needs significant attention is Adversarial Training, which aims to incorporate the competition between the generator and discriminator networks into the training process itself. 

The key insight behind Adversarial Training is to introduce a third neural network known as the Adversary Network whose task is to evaluate the output of the discriminator network based on misclassification errors caused by the generator network. By modifying the discriminator loss function with respect to the adversary’s error signal, the generator network learns to minimize the cross entropy loss plus the adversary’s penalty term, leading to improved sample quality and reduced mode collapse. Moreover, unlike existing regularizer techniques that either add constraints to the discriminator loss function or modify the generator loss function, Adversarial Training introduces no additional hyperparameters and can be easily integrated into any preexisting GAN architecture. Therefore, Adversarial Training has made significant progress in addressing the fundamental challenges of GANs and provides a promising direction for future work.

## Adversarial Loss Function
The core concept of Adversarial Training lies in the introduction of an adversary network that evaluates the discriminator’s output based on the generator's misclassification errors. In the case of GANs, the adversary network plays the role of the generator and takes in random noise vectors as inputs and generates fake images, which are then evaluated by the discriminator. The goal of the adversary network is to generate outputs that maximally confuse the discriminator and force it to make incorrect decisions. The loss function used to train the adversary network is typically defined as follows:

$$\mathcal{L}_a(D,G) = E_{x \sim p_{data}(x)}[\log D(x)] + E_{z \sim p_z(z)}[\log(1-D(G(z)))] $$

Here, $D$ and $G$ denote the discriminator and generator networks, respectively, $\{ x_i \}_{i=1}^N$ denotes the set of labeled data points, and $\{ z_i \}_{i=1}^M$ denotes the set of randomly sampled latent variables.

The first term represents the expected log probability of the true data under the discriminator, i.e., the probability of the discriminator correctly classifying real data. The second term represents the expected log probability of the fake data produced by the generator under the discriminator, i.e., the probability of the discriminator incorrectly classifying fake data. 

By minimizing this loss function, the adversary network learns to create samples that are difficult for the discriminator to classify accurately, making the generator less likely to fool the discriminator. As the discriminator becomes more accurate and less conservative, the second term becomes smaller, resulting in greater confidence levels assigned by the discriminator. This encourages the generator to push its samples further towards the decision boundary, increasing the overall confidence level of the discriminator and reducing mode collapse.

More specifically, let us consider the discriminator loss function $\mathcal{L}_d$ and the generator loss function $\mathcal{L}_g$. Considering that the adversary is trying to maximize its own loss $\max_{\phi}E_{x\sim\hat{\pi}}[\log(\sigma_\theta(-D_{\psi}(\theta)(x)-c))]$, we can write the full loss function as:

$\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_d+\alpha\mathcal{L}_a+\beta\mathcal{L}_g,$

where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are coefficients controlling the relative importance of the adversarial and discriminator losses, respectively. Intuitively, we want to balance the effects of the discriminator and adversarial losses, because they have different roles in guiding the generator to produce diverse and informative samples. If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are too large, the generator could begin to produce low-quality samples that are easy to confuse with the real data, whereas if they are too small, the discriminator could be too rigid and unable to adapt to new forms of distortion introduced by the generator.

It is worth noting that although the adversary network can play the role of the generator, it does not directly train the generator weights. Instead, the adversary network influences the gradients propagated through the generator weights indirectly via the discriminator weights. Specifically, the discriminator loss is computed using the current parameter values of the discriminator, but the gradients are estimated based on those corresponding to the adversarial perturbations used to compute the generator output. This allows the generator to adjust its outputs to match the desired properties of the discriminator, even though the actual changes are made only to the adversarial perturbations used to compute them.

Overall, Adversarial Training significantly improves the quality of generated samples, reduces mode collapse, and enables efficient sampling by leveraging a third neural network named the adversary.


## Adversarial Perturbation
Let us now focus on the details of the adversarial perturbation used to train the generator network. The specific formulation of the adversarial perturbation depends on the type of the generator. For example, if the generator maps latent variables to raw pixel intensities, we can define the adversarial perturbation as perturbing the pixels of the generated image. Alternatively, if the generator maps latent variables to high-dimensional features, we can define the adversarial perturbation as perturbing the features themselves. It is important to note that the choice of adversarial perturbation affects both the accuracy and consistency of the final generated results, so it is crucial to carefully tune the hyperparameters of the adversarial perturbation to ensure good performance.

One popular strategy for defining the adversarial perturbation is adding Gaussian white noise to the original image. This approach is simple, fast, and yields decent results across a wide range of tasks. On the other hand, other strategies exist such as using implicit noise models learned from dataset examples or using patch-based attacks. These advanced techniques can potentially yield higher fidelity results at the cost of increased computational complexity and longer convergence times.

Finally, it is worth emphasizing that adversarial training requires careful design of the discriminator and generator architectures to avoid suboptimal configurations that cause mode collapse or severe biases in the training data distribution. In fact, it is well-known that optimizing the discriminator too strongly can result in poor quality generated samples. Similarly, optimizing the generator too strongly can lead to mode collapse or instability, while choosing the right tradeoff between adversarial loss and generator loss can effectively leverage the strengths of both components.
