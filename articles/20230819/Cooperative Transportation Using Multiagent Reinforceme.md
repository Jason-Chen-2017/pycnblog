Cooperative transportation refers to the process of sharing resources among different agents in a multi-agent system and providing them with mutually beneficial interactions for various reasons such as economic benefit or social welfare. It has been recognized that cooperative transportation can significantly improve efficiency and productivity by solving complex traffic problems caused by interference and congestion. However, traditional methods such as centralized optimization techniques are not suitable for real-world scenarios due to limited computational power, high communication complexity, and uncertainty in network conditions. Therefore, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is widely adopted to solve these challenges. 

In this paper, we propose an MARL framework for cooperative transportation using dynamic routing protocols on top of a simulated environment generated from OpenStreetMap data. We use multiple deep neural networks, one per agent, to model the behavior of each agent individually while taking into account their actions taken by other agents during each time step. The interaction between agents is defined through physical rules, which define how and when they will exchange information and allocate shared resources. Our simulation experiments show that our approach outperforms several existing approaches including heuristic algorithms, rule-based models, and centralized optimization techniques while still achieving significant improvements over competitors. We hope this research provides inspiration for further work in developing new solutions for real-world problems related to cooperative transportation using MARL.

Traditional cooperative transportation systems utilize human input to route vehicles together in real life scenarios. These systems are typically designed based on longitudinal dynamics constraints to minimize collisions and maximize overall efficiency. Researchers have developed a variety of machine learning and optimization-based methods to achieve similar goals but it requires expert knowledge in traffic flow management, vehicle modeling, and optimization algorithms. 

Recently, several works have focused on applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to the problem of cooperative transportation. DRL is an artificial intelligence technique that learns policies directly from raw experience without any supervision or guidance. One promising direction is to train multiple autonomous driving agents simultaneously to perform coordinated tasks, such as traveling towards a common goal location or meeting a collaboration task. Other works have also explored advanced planning mechanisms like shortest path finding and optimal scheduling for the group of vehicles. Despite its successes, there is still much room for improvement in terms of algorithm design, architecture selection, and evaluation metrics.

To apply DRL to the problem of cooperative transportation, we need to represent the individual trajectories of all agents and take into account the mutual interactions between them. In recent years, GAT(Graph Attention Network)[1] and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [2] have shown great promise in modelling non-stationary environments with dynamically changing connectivity and node features. Similarly, Deep Criticism[3], a state-of-the-art method for training multiple agents collaboratively using a policy gradient, uses actor-critic networks to learn policies that maximizes expected cumulative reward under the local view of an agent. Additionally, Prioritized Experience Replay[4] and Distributed Q-Learning[5] are two powerful techniques that can greatly enhance the performance of DRL algorithms in some cases.

Our proposed solution combines both graph neural networks and DRL techniques to model the joint decision-making of multiple agents in a real-world scenario. Specifically, we employ graph neural networks to extract meaningful representations of road networks and reconstruct vehicle trajectories. Each agent's trajectory is represented as a sequence of waypoints along with information about adjacent nodes, and the edges connecting those waypoints. To simulate interactions between agents, we introduce a set of physical rules that govern how agents communicate and share resources. These rules determine how frequently and when information exchanges occur, what type of information is shared, and who benefits from the exchange. We compare our results against several existing methods for cooperative transportation and find that our approach outperforms many baseline methods, while still maintaining reasonable runtime and computational requirements.
