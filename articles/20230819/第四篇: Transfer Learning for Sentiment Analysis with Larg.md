# 1.简介
  

在深度学习模型发展的历史上，深度学习模型层出不穷。最早的AlexNet、VGG、ResNet、GoogleNet等网络结构都有很大的成功，但这些网络并没有考虑到深度学习所面临的实际应用中的各种复杂性。随着计算机计算能力的提升，深度学习网络的规模也越来越大，越来越深，但同时也带来了新的挑战——如何更好地利用训练好的深度学习模型来解决实际问题？近年来，深度学习技术在自然语言处理（NLP）领域有了长足的进步，比如预训练语言模型可以提升自然语言理解能力；句子或者文本分类任务中，深度学习模型已经在多个任务上超过传统机器学习方法。但是这些技术仍然无法直接用于 sentiment analysis。近年来，英语情感分析任务是NLP技术的一个热点研究课题，但现有的基于深度学习模型的方法仍然不能很好地适应不同的情感倾向，需要根据每个领域的特点进行定制化设计。因此，本文以情感分析为例，结合深度学习模型及预训练语言模型的方式，尝试探索一种有效的情感分析方式。

情感分析是一个关键词，它是NLP领域的一个重要任务。情感分析主要由两步完成，即特征抽取和分类。其中特征抽取通常是通过对文本的分词、词性标注、命名实体识别等手段，将文本转换成计算机可读的形式；而分类则是通过统计学习方法或神经网络方法对特征进行建模，从而确定文本的情感类别。
在特征抽取这一步骤，目前有多种模式被提出，包括词袋模型、n-gram模型、词嵌入模型、卷积神经网络模型等。n-gram模型是一种简单而粗糙的特征抽取方法，它认为相邻的n个词具有相同的意义。词嵌入模型是一种统计学习方法，它利用语言学的一些基本假设，如一切都是实数、向量空间中的词与上下文关系等，将单词用其向量表示。CNN模型是一种深度学习模型，它可以自动提取文本的局部、全局和时序特征，它在NLP任务中取得了显著的效果。在分类阶段，目前有基于规则的、基于模板的和基于神经网络的分类方法。基于规则的方法简单且容易实现，但是只能识别固定的情感类型。基于模板的方法能够识别多个情感类型，但它的学习效率较低。基于神经网络的方法是目前在情感分析领域占据主导地位的技术，它可以利用特征向量对文本进行分类。
在分类阶段，传统机器学习方法已经可以达到较高的准确率，但对于不同领域的文本来说，它的性能可能差距较大。为了缓解这个问题，一些研究者提出了预训练语言模型（Pre-trained language model），它可以利用大量的文本数据训练一个深度学习模型，然后作为起始点对其他任务进行fine-tuning。这种方法的优势是可以充分利用大型、通用的语言模型，使得情感分析任务能够获得比较好的结果。
Transfer learning is a technique that allows us to leverage the pre-trained models on a different task by simply reusing its learned features without having to train from scratch. It is one of the most common ways to improve performance in NLP tasks as it enables us to transfer general concepts and patterns learned during training to new domains where they may not be applicable. In this work, we will use transformers, an architecture developed by Google Research which has achieved state-of-the-art results on various natural language processing tasks such as translation or text classification. We will then fine-tune the transformer for sentiment analysis using Amazon review dataset to see if our approach can achieve improved performance compared to existing techniques. The experimental results will showcase how transfer learning can significantly enhance the performance of deep learning models in NLP tasks.

## 3.1 Transformer(Transformer)
Transformers are an attention mechanism designed to help neural networks overcome the limitation of recurrence and provide deeper contextual understanding than RNNs. In recent years, Transformers have been applied successfully across many NLP tasks such as machine translation, question answering, text summarization, and so on. To understand how these models work, let’s take a closer look at them. A transformer consists of multiple encoder layers and decoder layers stacked together along with positional encoding and a self-attention layer. Here’s what each component does:

Encoder Layers: These layers consist of multi-head attention mechanisms followed by feedforward neural networks (FFNs). Multi-head attention involves splitting the input into several heads, applying separate attention mechanisms on each head and concatenating the output back together. FFNs are used to map the hidden states obtained after attention to higher dimensional space. 

Decoder Layers: Similarly to the encoder layers, these also contain multi-head attention and FFN layers. However, instead of taking inputs directly from the source sentence, the decoder takes inputs generated by the previous time step from the decoded output itself. This makes the decoding process more efficient because it avoids redundant computations and focuses solely on generating accurate predictions. Additionally, the decoder uses teacher forcing, i.e., during inference, it passes the ground truth labels as input at each time step rather than predicted outputs. 

Positional Encoding: Positional encoding is another important feature added to the transformer architecture. It adds information about the position of the elements within the sequence, making sure that the model learns representations that reflect the order of the words better. One way to add positional encoding is to concatenate it to the embedded vectors before passing through any form of attention. Another option is to include it as part of the embedding function, i.e., the embedding vector corresponding to a word is actually the sum of its original embedding and its positional encoding. 

Self Attention Layer: Self attention refers to the transformer's ability to focus on specific parts of the input sequence based on their relationship with other parts. Each element of the input sequence receives equal weightage when computing the output representation. Unlike traditional attention mechanisms like softmax functions, self attention relies on relationships between individual elements within the sequence and doesn't require a fixed set of keys and values to compute similarity scores. Moreover, since self attention operates on a lower-dimensional subspace of the input, it requires less computational resources compared to CNNs and RNNs. Overall, self attention helps capture long-range dependencies between elements in the sequence and provides enhanced performance over standard attention mechanisms.

## 3.2 BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
BERT is a large-scale pretrained language model created by Google research. It stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers and was published in July 2019. BERT is particularly useful for two main reasons:

1. Better Performance: BERT achieves significant improvements in downstream tasks compared to conventional approaches like LSTMs or GRUs. Specifically, BERT outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on GLUE benchmark and SQuAD question answering. 

2. Transferability: With transfer learning, we can adapt the pre-trained BERT model to new tasks by freezing certain layers and training only some of them on the new data. This reduces the amount of computation required and speeds up the training process considerably. Additionally, we can integrate the pre-trained model into different applications such as chatbots or search engines to enable easy integration of natural language understanding capabilities.

The key difference between BERT and other similar models is that it uses both the left and right contexts while performing language modeling, whereas the LSTM architectures typically use just the current word but ignore the neighboring words. Using bidirectional context improves accuracy by capturing additional information beyond the immediate surrounding words. Other modifications made to the original model include using byte pair encodings to tokenize text, adding next sentence prediction loss to handle the issue of dependency ordering among sentences, and masking out random positions during training to prevent the model from peeking at the future during evaluation. Despite these changes, BERT still maintains the high level abstraction of representing language as a sequence of tokens.
