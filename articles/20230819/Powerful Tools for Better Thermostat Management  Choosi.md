# 1.简介
  

Thermostats are essential to maintaining body temperature and preventing heat stroke in our homes. They provide both comfort and safety while also reducing energy consumption. But it's not always easy to choose between different thermostat technologies. As an AI language model, I am dedicated to creating technical articles that provide valuable insights into how technology can enhance human well-being. My goal is to help readers understand the nuances of each type of thermostat technology by comparing their pros and cons. 

In this article, we will discuss several types of thermostat technologies available today and explore why people still struggle with making informed choices when selecting one for their home. We'll then take a look at some powerful tools available today to simplify thermostat management and encourage healthy habits. Finally, we'll share our experiences with thermostat owners as they evaluate which technology works best for them.


# 2.Conceptualization and Terminology
Before diving into the nitty gritty details, let's define some common terms used throughout the article: 

1. Celsius (°C) : Temperature unit in Celsius scale, which is commonly used outside. It represents degrees above or below absolute zero. For example, "27°C" means 27 degrees centigrade relative to absolute zero. In comparison, Fahrenheit (°F), which is also widely used within the United States, measures temperature in tenths of degrees above or below absolute zero. Therefore, "98.6°F" means 98.6 degrees fahrenheit relative to absolute zero.

2. Humidity (%): Relative humidity refers to the amount of water vapor in the air. When it's high, it indicates that there is more moisture in the air, so it needs heating to maintain its current temperature. The lower the humidity percentage, the colder it gets, which makes cooling necessary to keep the room comfortable. Humidity is measured using percentages. A typical value ranges from around 30% to 70%.

3. Setpoint (SP): The target temperature set point determines what temperature the thermostat should try to achieve. If the actual temperature exceeds the setpoint, the thermostat turns on the heat source to increase the temperature, leading to overheating. Similarly, if the actual temperature falls below the setpoint, the thermostat turns off the heat source to decrease the temperature, leading to freezing.

4. Outdoor temperature (OT): The outdoor temperature refers to the average air temperature outside your household. It helps predict the required room temperature for optimal comfort during daylight hours. You can obtain the outdoor temperature data from weather services like OpenWeatherMap or Dark Sky API.

5. Radiant temperature: The radiant temperature refers to the natural solar heat released by the sun onto the earth surface. It varies depending on latitude and time of year.

6. Absorptivity: Absorptivity describes how much of the heat radiated by the sun is absorbed by the atmosphere. Dry climates require more absorption than wet climates, resulting in less effective heating through windows and walls due to insufficient air movement to counteract the direct solar radiation.

7. Clotheslining: Clotheslining refers to arranging clothing pieces closer together for better insulation between them. This technique reduces the heat transfer across the outer layers of the clothing, allowing for better ventilation and cooling.

8. Ventilation mode: There are three main modes of ventilation: Natural, Heated Pad, and Split System. Natural ventilation involves natural circulation of air inside and outside the building. Heated pad ventilation uses an external heater located near the center of the building for additional cooling effectiveness. Split system ventilation involves installing multiple openings separated by skin panels, giving greater flexibility to adjust airflow direction.
