In this article we will learn about decision making strategies used by professionals involved in complex business environments. We will cover topics including defining priorities, addressing conflicts between conflicting objectives, managing stakeholder input, applying trade-off analysis, and understanding different types of information available for use in decision-making processes. 

We’ll also explore various algorithms and techniques used by decision makers across a wide range of fields, from financial markets to healthcare. In each case, we’ll explain how these methods work and show examples of their practical application in practice. We’ll conclude with some insights into future directions for decision making research and development.

This is an advanced level tutorial focused on technical explanations, code examples, and practical applications of important decision-making strategies. It assumes readers have basic knowledge of programming concepts and data structures, statistical analysis, and mathematical optimization. 

By the end of this article, you should be able to understand how to approach complex decision-making problems in order to make the most informed and beneficial decisions possible. You may even find new avenues for exploration beyond traditional methods that rely heavily on rules or subjective judgment. Best of luck!

# 2.前提条件
Before diving into details, it’s worth taking a moment to review the basics of decision making, specifically what constitutes “complex” decision-making scenarios and why they are so difficult to handle. Here are a few key points to keep in mind:

1. Complexity comes from the variety of issues faced by decision-makers in real-world business settings. They face many different challenges, including uncertainty, incomplete information, limited resources, and changing requirements over time. 

2. There can be tension between stakeholders who want a specific outcome but also want to balance competing priorities. This leads to conflicted decision-making situations where there isn’t always clear winner.

3. Decision-making requires a collaborative effort between all relevant parties, including those involved in negotiating contract terms, setting budgets, determining staff assignments, and making strategic investments. This brings in additional complexity when trying to evaluate potential solutions.

4. Despite best efforts, organizations still often encounter challenges in making consistent and sustainable decisions. This is particularly true in high-stakes environments like politics, law enforcement, finance, and healthcare. Strategies for resolving disputes effectively and efficiently help ensure consistency, but sometimes fail miserably.

Let's move on to discuss our main topic, decision making strategies.

## 3.1 Defining Priorities
One common strategy employed by decision-makers is to define a set of goals or objectives and then prioritize them according to relative importance. However, this process has limitations in handling complex decision-making scenarios where conflicting needs and constraints exist. Here are two primary reasons for this:

1. Competing priorities can lead to uneven distribution of resources among different activities or projects. This makes it harder for decision-makers to track progress towards achieving shared goals and ensuring overall sustainability.

2. The initial definition of priorities doesn't capture enough nuances or contextual information that could impact the final decision. As a result, the priority scheme becomes outdated quickly, leading to poor outcomes at times. Additionally, deliberate communication and dialogue between stakeholders plays a crucial role in shaping a comprehensive picture of the situation before making a decision.

To address these concerns, several decision-making methodologies have been proposed, including:

1. Weighting Methodology - A systematic weighting of criteria or attributes assigned to each option and then ranking them according to their weights.
2. Bias Analysis - An analysis of biases held by individuals or groups in selecting one option over another.
3. Voting System - A formalized vote process with rankings given to candidates based on merits, demerits, and preferences. 
4. Consensus Building - A deliberate process of sharing ideas, perspectives, and opinions through discussion and group conversation to reach a consensus.

These methodologies provide structured and objective ways of assessing the relative importance of different options without getting bogged down in unnecessary debates or arguments. By following a prescribed process, stakeholders can come to a more collectively agreed-upon understanding of the relative value of various options while ensuring appropriate consideration of relevant facts and contextual information.

## 3.2 Addressing Conflicts Between Objectives
Another challenge faced by decision-makers is to manage any conflicts between conflicting objectives. One common scenario is where stakeholders want to increase profits by increasing revenue but decrease costs. This can lead to negative externalities where increased revenue results in higher costs and vice versa, causing losses for both sides. To avoid these kinds of problems, decision-makers need to carefully consider which goal(s) to pursue and focus on reducing the risk of each other instead of optimizing for self-interest only. 

There are several tools and techniques that can be used to manage conflicts between conflicting objectives. Here are three commonly used ones:

1. Trade-Off Analysis - This involves comparing and analyzing the benefits and risks associated with different choices and deciding on the optimal solution that balances these trade-offs. Commonly used metrics include Return On Investment (ROI), Cost-Benefit Ratio (CBR), Net Present Value (NPV), Economic Value Added (EVA), and Leverage Effectiveness Index (LEI).

2. Scenario Planning - This involves creating multiple alternative scenarios that represent different combinations of conditions and assumptions. Each scenario provides a basis for evaluation and comparison to identify the best course of action.

3. Escalation Processes - These involve bringing up issues of escalating uncertainties, delays, or disagreements to the highest-level authority or management responsible for decision-making. Frequent escalations can cause frustration and confusion within the organization, resulting in lost trust and reduced efficiency.

Overall, effective decision-making relies on careful thoughtfulness combined with precise analytical skills and sound judgement. Just like any other aspect of life, good decision-making requires constant experimentation, learning, and iteration until successful outcomes emerge.
