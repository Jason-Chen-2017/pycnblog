# 1.简介
  


Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a pre-trained model on one task is used as the starting point for training another related task. It has been shown that transfer learning can significantly reduce the time and resources required to develop deep learning models while improving their accuracy on the target tasks. Transfer learning is widely applied across multiple domains such as image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, etc., with many successful applications in industry today. In this article we will explore how transfer learning works at a high level by focusing specifically on deep neural networks (DNNs). We will also explain various terms and concepts involved in transfer learning along with the mathematical basis of DNN transfer learning algorithms. Finally, we will showcase several code examples demonstrating the implementation of different transfer learning techniques using PyTorch library in Python. This article assumes readers have some basic knowledge of machine learning and deep learning principles and are familiar with fundamental concepts of DNNs.

# 2.基本概念与术语
Before diving into transfer learning, let's first understand some basic terminology and concepts of deep neural networks(DNNs) which we need to keep handy throughout the article.

1. **Neuron:** A neuron is an artificial unit that takes input from other neurons and produces output signal based on its activation function. Each neuron receives weights associated with each input from other neurons and combines them linearly to produce the final output. The weight matrix defines the strength of connection between two layers or neurons.
2. **Layer:** Layers are collections of neurons arranged in sequence to perform complex computations on the input data. There are generally three types of layers: input layer, hidden layer and output layer. 
3. **Activation Function:** Activation functions are non-linear transformations performed on the weighted sum of inputs before passing it through the next layer. Common activation functions include sigmoid, ReLU, tanh, softmax, etc.
4. **Weight Decay Regularization:** Weight decay regularization adds a penalty term to the cost function which encourages small weights during training. The goal is to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance.
5. **Epochs/Iterations:** Epoch refers to the complete iteration over all training samples in the dataset whereas Iteration refers to the number of batches processed in each epoch. 

Now that we have understood the basics of DNNs, we can move forward to understanding transfer learning in more detail.

**What Is Transfer Learning?**
Transfer learning involves taking advantage of a pre-existing model trained on one task and applying it to a new but related task without having to train the entire model from scratch. This reduces the amount of time and computational resources needed to train a model, makes it easier to adapt existing models to new situations and enable transferability of learned features across different problems. Transfer learning has been shown to be effective in multiple domains including computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, medical imaging, and so on. Transfer learning is mainly used when there is not enough labeled training data available for both source and target tasks and when only few annotated instances of the target class are available.

In summary, transfer learning involves leveraging pre-trained models on one domain to assist in solving a new problem in a similar domain with fewer or no labeled data. 

Let’s now move further to learn about specific deep neural network transfer learning algorithms. 

**Types of Transfer Learning Algorithms**
There are different ways of performing transfer learning using deep neural networks depending on the type of input data and size of the dataset. Some common methods include feature extraction, fine tuning, and distillation. Let’s go through these methods one by one.

1. Feature Extraction: 
Feature extraction consists of extracting useful features from the input data without any additional supervision. For example, if you want to classify images based on their content, you may extract visual features such as edges, shapes, colors, textures, etc. You don't need labelled data for this approach because you just use the pre-trained CNN architecture to predict the labels directly from the extracted features. 

2. Fine Tuning: 
Fine tuning is a strategy where a pre-trained model is first frozen or set to a fixed state, then unfreezing some of the layers or even all of them and adjusting the parameters for the new task. This allows the model to pick up certain patterns from the pre-training data that were relevant to the original classification task. Additionally, fine tuning often helps in achieving better accuracy than simply training the model from scratch for the new task. However, it requires careful hyperparameter optimization and regularization to avoid overfitting. 

3. Distillation:
Distillation is a compression method that involves compressing the large teacher model into a smaller student model by minimizing the knowledge loss between the two models. The key idea behind distillation is that a complex teacher model can be compressed into a simpler student model by removing most of the complexity and instead retaining only the important information about the target task. Once the student model is trained, it can still make predictions like the original teacher model, but its ability to do so is reduced due to the compression process.  

In conclusion, transfer learning enables efficient utilization of pre-trained models on a variety of tasks by reducing the time and resources needed to train new models on novel datasets. Various algorithms exist to achieve this, ranging from simple feature extraction, fine tuning, to advanced approaches such as distillation.
