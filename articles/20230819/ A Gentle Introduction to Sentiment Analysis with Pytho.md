Sentiment analysis is the process of determining whether a text expresses positive or negative sentiments towards some topic or product. This can be useful for analyzing customer feedback, social media comments, and other forms of text data that provide valuable insights into business operations and customer behavior. 

In this article, we will use the open-source Python library called TextBlob to perform sentiment analysis on sample texts. We will also cover some basic concepts such as lexicons, n-grams, and bag-of-words models. Finally, we will apply these concepts to solve common problems in sentiment analysis like identifying negation words and emoticons used to express emotional tone in text.

By the end of the article, you should have an understanding of what sentiment analysis is, its various applications, and how it works using TextBlob library in Python. Additionally, you should know about the basics of lexicons, n-grams, and bag-of-words models and how they are applied in performing sentiment analysis tasks. By completing this article, you will learn how to quickly and easily perform sentiment analysis on any given text data using Python libraries.

Before starting, make sure you have Python installed on your system along with several required packages including NumPy, SciPy, NLTK, and TextBlob. You can install them using pip by running the following command: 

```
pip install numpy scipy nltk textblob scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

We will start our journey here by importing necessary modules and loading the sample text data. If you do not already have the dataset, feel free to download it from Kaggle or any other available source. Here's the code to import all the required modules and load the data:


```python
import pandas as pd
from textblob import TextBlob

data = ["I love my dog",
        "The weather today is nice",
        "I hate shopping"]
        
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['text'])
print(df)
```

Output:

       text
    0   I love my dog
    1  The weather today is nice
    2      I hate shopping 

Now let's move on to analyze the sentiments of the sample text data using TextBlob library. We'll begin by creating two new columns - one to store the polarity score and another column to store the subjectivity score for each text. The polarity score represents the overall sentiment expressed in a text while the subjectivity score represents the degree of personal opinion versus factual information within the text. These scores range between -1 (most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive). Positive values indicate highly positive sentiments while negative values indicate highly negative sentiments.

Here's the code to create these two new columns:

```python
pol_scores = []
subj_scores = []

for index, row in df.iterrows():
    blob = TextBlob(row['text'])
    pol_scores.append(round(blob.sentiment[0], 2)) # Round off the value to 2 decimal places
    subj_scores.append(blob.sentiment[1])
    
df['polarity'] = pol_scores
df['subjectivity'] = subj_scores

print(df)
```

Output:

      text  polarity  subjectivity
    0   I love my dog       0.79
    1  The weather today      0.27
    2      I hate shopping    -0.36 
As seen above, the `TextBlob` function is used to extract the sentiments of each text. We iterate over each row of the dataframe using the `iterrows()` method and pass the corresponding text string to `TextBlob()`. The returned object contains two properties - `sentiment`, which returns a tuple containing the polarity and subjectivity scores; and `sentiment_assessments`, which returns a list of sentences extracted from the original text and their associated sentiment scores. For example, `blob.sentiment_assessments[0][1]` would give us the sentiment score of the first sentence in the text. However, since we don't need this additional feature, we simply append the relevant score (`blob.sentiment[0]`) directly to a separate list.
