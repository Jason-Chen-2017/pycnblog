Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular technique used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets by transforming them into new orthogonal uncorrelated variables called principal components. The goal of PCA is to identify patterns that can be explained as linear combinations of these components. It has been widely applied in various fields such as finance, biology, medicine, social science, engineering, and many others due to its ability to capture complex relationships between different dimensions of data. PCA is commonly used for clustering, anomaly detection, pattern recognition, and feature selection. However, it has also been used in healthcare industry for detecting abnormal events, diagnosing disease states, predicting outcomes, and identifying treatment strategies based on patient symptoms. This article will introduce you to the basic principles and applications of PCA in the financial and healthcare industries. 

PCA is an iterative algorithm that repeatedly constructs new principal components until convergence is reached. At each iteration, it takes the current estimate of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix and rotates the input data set using those eigenvectors to maximize their variance while minimizing the correlation with previous principal components. By removing redundant or less informative principal components, we can obtain a lower-dimensional representation of the original data. Moreover, PCA can be extended to include non-linear transformations through the use of kernel functions. Kernel PCA is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data since it enables us to project the data onto a higher dimensional space while preserving most of the important features of the dataset.

In this article, we will focus on explaining how PCA works in finance and healthcare industries along with some practical examples of how they are utilized. We hope that this article will help researchers, analysts, and developers understand the importance and potential benefits of applying PCA in various domains within both medical and technology sectors. 

# 2. Finance and Healthcare Industry Background
## 2.1 Financial Applications of PCA
PCA was originally developed in the field of statistical learning theory during the early years of the twentieth century. Although it did not become widespread till the mid-twenty-first century, it still plays a crucial role in many financial markets. In fact, PCA is widely used in portfolio management, risk management, factor investing, market prediction, and other areas related to analyzing multivariate data. Here's a brief overview of the key steps involved in performing PCA for finance:

1. Data preprocessing: Preprocess the raw data by cleaning, standardization, normalization, imputation, and so on.
2. Calculation of Covariance Matrix: Calculate the covariance matrix of the preprocessed data which measures the pairwise covariances among all the independent variables.
3. Eigenvalue Decomposition: Compute the eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues from the covariance matrix using a spectral decomposition method such as SVD or eigendecomposition methods like QR or Cholesky decomposition.
4. Identification of Principal Components: Select the number of principal components to retain based on the desired level of explainability.
5. Projection of Original Data: Project the original data onto the selected principal components to obtain the reduced-dimensional output.

## 2.2 Healthcare Applications of PCA
PCA is widely used in several healthcare applications, including diagnosis and prognosis of diseases, identification of biomarkers, drug response modeling, and forecasting mortality rates. Here are some common scenarios where PCA is used: 

1. Compressed sensing: When trying to recover a signal from incomplete measurements, PCA is often used to reconstruct the missing values using only a small subset of the measured data points. For example, if one wants to measure an object under the microscope but fails to take images of every detail, PCA can be used to infer the missing details from the remaining measurements.

2. Anomaly detection: During the process of monitoring systems, PCA can be used to identify abnormal patterns that do not conform to known behavioral patterns. For instance, in an online retail store, PCA can be used to identify customers who behave differently than typical shopping behavior based on their purchase history.

3. Clustering: To group similar patients based on their genetic profile, PCA can be used to extract the relevant features and cluster them together based on their similarity. Similarly, in the field of cardiovascular diseases, PCA can be used to identify patients who share common markers of heart failure such as age, gender, blood pressure levels, etc., leading to more targeted treatments.

4. Regression: When developing models for predicting outcomes, PCA can be used to select the most important factors influencing the outcome variable while ignoring noise or irrelevant variables. For example, in a retail company wanting to develop a model to predict customer demand, PCA can be used to identify the most critical features affecting customer purchasing decisions without considering irrelevant information such as demographics or product descriptions.

Overall, PCA offers a powerful tool for exploring complex relationships and patterns within complex datasets. Whether used for fraud detection, disease progression, or investment strategy recommendations, there is no question that it holds immense promise for improving accuracy, reducing costs, and enhancing overall efficiency across a wide range of industries.
