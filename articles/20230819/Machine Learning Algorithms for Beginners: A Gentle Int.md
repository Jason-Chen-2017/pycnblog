## Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI), which allows computers to learn from experience without being explicitly programmed. The goal of machine learning algorithms is to develop computer programs that can improve on their performance with new data or in real-time scenarios.

In this article, we will introduce two fundamental types of ML algorithms: Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. We will also explain the basic concepts behind these algorithms and show how they work step by step using practical examples. 

The end result should be an easy-to-understand explanation of these algorithms with clear explanations of mathematical formulas and implementation details. This article is designed for those who are starting out with machine learning but have some background knowledge in statistics, probability theory, and linear algebra.

The audience for this article would be software engineers, developers, AI researchers, mathematicians, statisticians, and anyone interested in understanding the basics of modern machine learning techniques.

# 2.Naive Bayes Algorithm 
# 2.1 Overview 
Naive Bayes algorithm is one of the most simple yet effective classification algorithms. It is used when the features in the dataset are independent of each other. In other words, the presence of one feature does not affect the presence of another feature. For example, let’s say we have a spam email classifier system where we want to classify whether an incoming email is spam or ham based on its text and sender address. One approach could be to use bag-of-words model where we treat each word individually and do not consider the order in which they occur in the message. Another way could be to use TF-IDF weighting scheme. Both approaches involve extracting features from the input text and feeding them into a machine learning model.  

In the case of naive bayes algorithm, we assume that all the features are conditionally independent given the target class label. This means that the presence of one feature does not impact the presence of any other feature regardless of the value of the target class label. Therefore, we calculate the probability of each feature belonging to each possible target class label independently. We then multiply these individual probabilities together to get the overall probability of the instance being assigned to a particular target class label.

Let us now see how the algorithm works step by step:

# 2.2 Algorithm Steps

1. Calculate the prior probability of each class:
   
   - Total number of instances of each class 
   
   - Divide total by the sum of total count across all classes
   
 
2. Calculate the likelihood of each feature given the class:
   
   - Count the frequency of each feature per class
    
   - Normalize the counts by dividing by the total number of features in the training set
   
3. Compute the posterior probability of each feature for each class:
   
   - Multiply the prior probability of the class
   
   - Multiply the likelihood of each feature given the class
   
   - Sum up the products
    
# 2.3 Example 

Suppose we have a training set consisting of 6 emails labeled as “spam” and 4 emails labeled as “ham”. Our task is to build a spam email classifier system using the naive bayes algorithm. Let’s assume that each email consists of three separate features: length, number of words, and the presence of links. 

Here is how we can apply the above steps to compute the posterior probability of each feature for both classes: 

1. Prior Probabilities:

   Spam = 6/10
   
   Ham = 4/10
   
2. Likelihood Probabilities:
   
   Length | Spam     | Ham     
    -----|----------|----------
       0 |  0       |   1     
       1 |  1/9*2   |   1/7*2 
       2 |  1/9*2   |   1/7*2 
       3 |  0       |   3/7*2 
        
   Number of Words | Spam     | Ham     
    ----------------|----------|----------
         0         | 0        | 1
         >0          | 1/9*2    | 1/7*2 
           ...     |  .      |  .
            n         | 1/9*2    | 1/7*2
            
   Links | Spam     | Ham     
    ------|----------|----------
       y | 1/3*2   | 2/7*2  
      no | 2/3*2   | 2/7*2 
    
3. Posterior Probabilities:

    Class   Feature     Value  |   P(Feature=Value|Class=Spam) * P(Class=Spam)
                 Length  0      |           0
                Length  1      |          1/9*2
               Length  2      |          1/9*2
              Length  3      |            0
                 NumWords 0      |             0 
                NumWords i>0  |             1/9*2
                    Links Y     |            1/3*2
                   Links No     |           2/3*2

       Class   Feature     Value  |   P(Feature=Value|Class=Ham) * P(Class=Ham)
                 Length  0      |           1
                Length  1      |          1/7*2
               Length  2      |          1/7*2
              Length  3      |           3/7*2
                 NumWords 0      |             1 
                NumWords i>0  |             1/7*2
                    Links Y     |           2/7*2
                   Links No     |           2/7*2

Finally, we can choose the class label with the highest posterior probability for each email. For example, the first email belongs to the "ham" category because it has zero length and five words and does not contain any links. On the other hand, the second email belongs to the "spam" category since it has length greater than zero, four words, and contains links. Overall, this naive bayes algorithm works well in practice and provides fast and accurate results.
