# 1.简介
  

This article presents a simple Python program to compute the mass and center of gravity (CoG) of an arbitrary number of objects in space using Newton's law of gravitation. The code is easy to understand and modify, making it ideal for learning or teaching purposes. 

The main goal of this project is to provide beginners with a hands-on experience on how numerical simulations can be used to study physical systems such as planetary motion, molecular dynamics, or interstellar medium. By replicating realistic models of celestial bodies and their interactions within the solar system, we hope that our work will inspire students, researchers, engineers, and scientists to apply scientific methods and computational tools to solve challenging problems in physics, chemistry, engineering, and biology.


We'll start by explaining what computing mass and CoG means and why it is important. Then, we'll explain key principles of Newtonian mechanics including central force, frictional forces, and conservation laws. Next, we'll implement these ideas in Python and demonstrate how they can be applied to simulate the movement of objects in space. Finally, we'll discuss potential extensions and applications of our model.

Let's get started!

# 2.Definitions
## 2.1 What is Mass?
Mass refers to the quantity of matter in an object or a collection of objects at rest. In general, there are two types of masses: static mass and dynamic mass. Static mass refers to any object that doesn't move relative to other objects; examples include stones, metals, glass, and dirt. On the other hand, dynamic mass includes objects that do move around, such as planets, stars, and asteroids. 

## 2.2 Why Is It Important to Compute Mass?
Mass is essential because it determines the strength of an object, its resistance to acceleration due to gravity, and even its rotation speed in certain scenarios. For example, if an object has relatively high mass, it won't have enough power to overcome the pull of the Earth's gravity. Similarly, if an object has very low mass, it may become unstable or fall apart under high tension. Consequently, measuring and predicting mass accurately is crucial for many applications involving physical systems, including sports, transportation, exploration, medical care, and aerospace.

Measuring mass is not always straightforward, especially when dealing with complex physical structures such as those found in astrophysical objects. However, one approach to measure mass accurately is to use computer simulation techniques. These techniques allow us to recreate physical processes such as collisions, frictional forces, and attraction between different objects without actually touching them. By analyzing the results obtained from simulated calculations, we can estimate the true mass of a given object. This technique has been used extensively in fields ranging from meteorology to spaceflight to nuclear science.

It is worth noting that while computers can sometimes help with estimation, they cannot substitute for human observers who carefully analyze real-world observations. Nevertheless, modern computer technology makes it possible to perform simulations quickly, often achieving accuracy comparable to experiments. Nonetheless, accurate measurement of mass remains an ongoing challenge in science and industry.

## 2.3 Central Force
Central force is a fundamental concept of Newtonian mechanics. It describes the tendency of a body to align itself with the direction of the line connecting it to the gravitational field. When two bodies come into contact with each other, the result is usually a net force acting on both bodies that exerts a torque on one of them. Mathematically, central force can be expressed as:

F = Gm1m2 / r^2 * rhat, where F is the force vector, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two bodies, r is the distance between them, and rhat is a unit vector pointing from body 1 towards body 2.

To find the total force acting on an object, we add up all the individual forces acting on it, including the gravitational force and any other forces such as air resistance or electromagnetic fields. Thus, finding the net force acting on an object requires knowledge of all its individual components.

## 2.4 Friction
Friction is another important concept in Newtonian mechanics. It relates to the transfer of energy from moving surfaces to static regions through viscous effects. Friction can cause sudden changes in velocity and vibrations, causing significant disturbances in motion. In order to counteract friction, objects need to change their velocities slowly during impacts, so that the resulting collision occurs smoothly. Friction coefficient is typically measured in percentages or ratio to the normal force, denoted as μ. Mathematically, friction force can be written as:

τ = μ * Fn, where τ is the tangential force, Fn is the normal force, and μ is the friction coefficient.

Overall, friction acts to maintain equilibrium in situations where surface motion is allowed to occur freely. As a result, friction plays a role in many natural phenomena such as fluid flow, slipping of shoes, and camouflage. Despite its importance, however, the exact mechanisms underlying friction are poorly understood, making it difficult to design effective control systems for precise manipulation tasks.

## 2.5 Conservation Laws
Newton's first law states that "For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction." This principle states that the rate at which stuff moves is directly proportional to the amount of matter contained within it. Newton's second law states that "Energy is conserved in a system.". This principle implies that the sum of kinetic and potential energy in a system does not change as time passes, and hence provides a basis for predicting the future state of the system based on past behavior. Therefore, it is useful to consider several equations of motion to ensure consistency and avoid instability. Some common conservation laws in classical mechanics include:

1. Planetary Motion Law: Energy is conserved in the planetary system. That is, the rate of change of momentum and angular momentum is independent of external factors except the initial conditions. 

2. Hooke's Law: Hookes' law relates the deformation gradient tensor to stress tensors and describes the relation between deformations and stresses experienced by materials. 

3. Einstein Field Equations: These set of four equations describe the relation between various wave functions in quantum mechanics. They impose constraints on the distribution function of particles and include a constraint related to symmetries of the interaction between electrons. 

4. Stokes' Law: This equation expresses the law of heat flow, which states that the rate of transfer of heat from one region to another is proportional to the temperature difference between the two regions. 

Combining these laws allows us to predict the behavior of complex systems, identify critical points, and identify stable solutions to boundary value problems.
