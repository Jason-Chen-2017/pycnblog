# As the current generation of financial technologies and services continue to rapidly expand, banking industry is becoming a vital player in shaping how consumers interact with financial institutions today. Banks play an essential role as providing various financial products such as loans, credit cards, mortgages, etc., which are used for cash withdrawals, saving money, or even investments. 

Banks have been through several transformations during the last few years, from being mainly focused on traditional banking activities towards digital transformation and new market opportunities. One of these changes was the introduction of AI into the financial sector, where banks started using machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to automate their business processes. However, there has been relatively little research conducted on how banks can utilize AI tools effectively within this context, especially when it comes to creating value for customers and generating revenue streams. 

To address this gap in knowledge, we present an overview of recent advancements in the field of AI-powered banking that will help bankers better understand how they can use technology to create more effective marketing strategies, improve customer experience, generate higher profitability, and ultimately lead to increased returns for businesses. The article explores the different components involved in the process of creating value, including data collection, model training, model optimization, and decision making, highlighting some key challenges faced by banks while applying AI methods. Additionally, we provide insights on how AI-powered banking might reshape the banking industry’s future direction, allowing for greater collaboration between departments and a focus on driving profits and sustainable growth for all stakeholders.

The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of recent advancements in AI-powered banking. We will begin our discussion by introducing the key actors and principles involved in the creation and implementation of AI-powered banking solutions. Next, we will discuss the different stages of the banking life cycle and describe the roles played by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) models within each stage. Finally, we will introduce the core concepts of Data Science, specifically supervised and unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing, before concluding with a brief summary of the main benefits and risks of AI-powered banking.

Data: Financial transaction history, demographics information, personal assets, employee behavior, risk factors, credit reports, financial transactions logs, and so on are considered as data sources.

Artificial Intelligence (AI): An AI system is a computer program that simulates human intelligence and can perform tasks that typically require conscious thought or reasoning, such as pattern recognition, image understanding, speech recognition, or decision-making. AI systems use rules, logic, statistical analysis, and mathematical calculations to make predictions about complex problems. There are two types of AI models: supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning involves labeled datasets, which are used to train the algorithm to map inputs to outputs based on prior knowledge. Unsupervised learning, also called clustering or dimensionality reduction, uses unlabelled data to identify patterns and relationships in the dataset. Reinforcement learning involves training agents to learn by trial and error, similar to how animals and robots learn from rewards and punishments. Natural Language Processing (NLP), also known as text analytics, enables machines to interpret human language and carry out a wide range of tasks like sentiment analysis, entity recognition, topic modeling, and spam filtering.

Machine Learning (ML): ML refers to a class of algorithms developed to imitate the way humans learn from examples and improve their performance over time. It helps software applications autonomously learn and improve from feedback without being explicitly programmed to do so. This type of automation makes ML a popular choice among big companies due to its ease of deployment and scalability. Another advantage of ML is that it can learn without any pre-defined instructions or targets, enabling it to find correlations and trends across large volumes of data automatically.

Supervision: During supervised learning, the input data is given both correct labels and expected outputs. This allows the algorithm to adjust itself to reduce errors and achieve high accuracy levels. For example, if you want your computer to recognize images of cats, you would label them correctly with "cat" and "dog", and then give the algorithm thousands of cat and dog images to learn from. When testing the algorithm, it could be tested against previously seen images, but only those correctly identified as cats should receive positive marks, whereas incorrectly identified images would get negative marks.

Unsupervised learning: With unsupervised learning, no ground truth output values are provided. Instead, the algorithm must infer hidden structures or patterns in the data, often referred to as clusters or groups. For instance, if you were analyzing a set of emails, you may group together messages that talk about certain topics, such as sales or finance. Similarly, when looking at stock prices, an algorithm might group together companies with similar trading histories.

Reinforcement learning: Reinforcement learning involves training an agent to choose actions that maximize long-term reward based on its perception of the environment and past decisions. For instance, if an agent is playing a game of chess, it needs to learn how to select moves that result in winning the game. The agent learns what good moves look like, what bad moves are dangerous, and how to balance exploration versus exploitation. Reinforcement learning is particularly useful in situations where the goal state is uncertain, because it can explore the environment to discover new paths to success.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP involves extracting meaningful information from textual data, such as identifying entities, keywords, phrases, or sentiment. Sentiment analysis looks at the emotional tone of text to determine whether it expresses positivity, negativity, or neutrality. Entity recognition identifies named individuals, organizations, locations, dates, times, quantities, or amounts mentioned in text. Topic modeling captures the common themes or ideas discussed in a corpus of documents, allowing analysts to identify important issues and take action accordingly. Spam filtering uses techniques like naive Bayes classification to detect email messages that are likely to be spam, fraudulent activity, or other irrelevant content.
