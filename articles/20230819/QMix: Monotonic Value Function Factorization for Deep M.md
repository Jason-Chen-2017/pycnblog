Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a challenging problem with many practical applications in domains such as cooperative robotics, distributed energy resource allocation, and large-scale traffic management. Despite its significant impact on the real world problems, existing MARL methods are typically based on approaches that do not take into account agent interactions and generate mixed policies, which may lead to suboptimal performance or instability during training. In this paper, we propose a new model called QMix that addresses these issues by factorizing the value function of each agent using shared parameters across all agents. This leads to a more stable and unified policy, where individual agents can still produce different behaviors while sharing some components of their policies. We evaluate our approach on various multi-agent environments from standard benchmark tasks to emerging ones, showing competitive results compared to state-of-the-art baselines and outperforming them under certain scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate how QMix can be easily combined with other state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms such as actor-critic methods and distributional RL techniques. Our code and experiments are publicly available at https://github.com/koulanurag/qmix.

Reinforcement learning (RL), also known as dynamic programming, is one of the most commonly used machine learning techniques for decision making. It has been widely applied in fields such as game playing, robotics, and control theory, but it is particularly promising in complex environments with multiple interacting agents. However, designing effective strategies for a team of agents requires considering interactions among them, which makes multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) an important research topic. One of the challenges faced by traditional MARL approaches is that they typically use global observations or representations that do not capture local dependencies between agents, leading to uncoordinated behavior or suboptimal solutions. To address this issue, recent work has proposed several algorithmic advances that focus on leveraging local information through a combination of exploration and exploitation, planner-based techniques like Hierarchical Task Network Planning (HTN), neural network-based planning models like Neural Architecture Search (NAS), and intrinsic motivation mechanisms like curiosity-driven exploration. These techniques have helped to significantly improve the sample efficiency and convergence rate of MARL algorithms, but they do not necessarily guarantee optimal policies or solutions. 


# 3.QMix模型简介
In recent years, there has been increasing interest in applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to multi-agent problems, where each agent acts independently but shares a common goal and environment. Despite their success, previous works often suffer from two main drawbacks: firstly, they treat each agent separately without taking into account interdependencies; secondly, they use shared parameters to parameterize the value function, leading to redundant computations and instability during training. 

To overcome these limitations, we propose a new DRL model called QMix, which factors the value function of each agent using shared parameters across all agents. The key idea behind QMix is to decouple the computation of actions from the computation of values by using a separate set of learned parameters for each action instead of a single function. Specifically, we learn independent Q-functions for each action that map from states, actions pairs to expected rewards. Then, we combine these functions to form the joint Q-function, whose estimate is closer to the true Q-value since it takes into account both individual agent policies and joint interaction effects. Moreover, we introduce a mixing coefficient vector that controls the relative importance of individual agent policies vs. joint interactions, enabling us to balance tradeoffs between individual agents' goals and exploration while ensuring robustness against collisions or communication failures.

We empirically validate the effectiveness of QMix on several popular multi-agent environments, including large cooperative games such as Sonic and Atari, as well as transportation and resource allocation settings. Compared to strong baselines such as A3C and CoMA, QMix achieves significantly better sample efficiency and converges faster than state-of-the-art deep RL methods, especially when the number of agents grows beyond a certain threshold. Additionally, we show that QMix can be integrated seamlessly with other state-of-the-art DRL algorithms such as A2C, PPO, and IMPALA, demonstrating its flexibility and scalability. 


# 4.核心算法原理及操作步骤
QMix is a centralized architecture that operates at three levels: agent level, enviroment level and task level. Each agent interacts with the environment within a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The environment consists of a fixed number of static entities that serve as obstacles or landmarks, along with a variable number of movable agents who share a common goal and receive reward from the environment. During training, the agent selects an action using its local Q-function, which maps from the current state and action pair to the corresponding expected reward. After selecting an action, the agent receives feedback from the environment about the next state and a scalar reward signal, which is then fed back to its local Q-function. The agent updates its local Q-function using the Bellman equation, which involves estimating the maximum future discounted return for each possible action given the current state and action taken by the agent. 

The central challenge of QMix lies in coordinating the interactions among different agents, which necessitate building a shared representation of the environment and establishing trust relationships between agents to encourage cohesive behavior. Here's the detailed procedure of the QMix algorithm: 

1. Initialize the Q-function for each agent and initialize the target networks by copying the weights of the online Q-network.

2. Collect experience tuples $(o_i^t,a_i^t,r_{ij}^t,o_j^{t+1},d_i^{t+1})$ from each agent i following its local MDP until termination condition is met. $o_i^t$, $a_i^t$, and $r_{ij}^t$ represent the observation, action, and reward obtained by agent i at time t, respectively. $o_j^{t+1}$ represents the observation received by agent j after executing action $a_i^t$. $d_i^{t+1}$ indicates whether the episode ends after step t+1.

3. Compute the mix coefficients $\phi_i$ for each agent based on its contribution to the joint Q-value estimate. For example, if agent i plays the role of an advisor, $\phi_i \approx e^{-||v_{\theta}^{i} - v_{\bar{\theta}}^{i}||}$, where $v_{\theta}^{i}(s)$ denotes the estimated value function for agent i when being followed by an expert, and $v_{\bar{\theta}}^{i}(s)$ denotes the baseline value function when the agent follows only itself. Otherwise, $\phi_i = 1$.

4. Update the joint Q-function for each agent based on the collected experiences using the same loss functions as the original DQN method, except that the target q-values are computed using the target networks rather than the actual values.

5. Periodically update the target networks by setting their weights equal to the online networks.

6. Use the trained joint Q-function to compute the policy for each agent, which maps from the current state s to the probability distribution p(a|s) over available actions. Choose an action according to a stochastic policy derived from the softmax function of the joint Q-values. Return the final accumulated reward for the entire team.

# 5.数学原理
Here are some brief explanations of mathematical concepts related to QMix:
## 1. Action Space Discretization
Since continuous action spaces are generally too high dimensional, we discretize the action space into a finite set of options. Specifically, let $A_i$ denote the i-th discrete action and $A = \{A_1,\cdots,A_n\}$. Each action $A_i$ corresponds to a certain subset of feasible actions $\tilde{a}_i$. For instance, suppose the agent can move forward and turn left/right with angles $\alpha$ degrees and $\beta$ degrees, respectively. Then, the i-th action $A_i$ can correspond to moving forward with angle $\alpha+\frac{1}{3}\delta\alpha$ and turning right with angle $\beta+\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\delta\beta$, where $\delta\alpha=\frac{\alpha-\beta}{\sqrt{3}}$ and $\delta\beta=-\frac{\alpha-\beta}{\sqrt{3}}$ are the increments due to the clockwise and counterclockwise turns, respectively. We assume that the increment size $\delta\alpha$ and $\delta\beta$ are small enough so that any deviation from the intended direction will result in minimal change in the action. 

Using this discretization scheme, we can approximate the Q-function for each agent by treating it as a table lookup function that maps from $(s,A_i)$ to the expected reward given state $s$ and action $A_i$. Thus, the total Q-function for all agents is simply the sum of the individual Q-functions weighted by their respective mix coefficients.

## 2. Mixing Coefficient Vector
The mixing coefficient vector $\phi=(\phi_1,\cdots,\phi_n)^T$ specifies the relative importance of individual agent policies vs. joint interactions. Intuitively, if $\phi_i=1$, then the agent i should play solely responsible and exploit its own knowledge, while those with smaller values should act together and collaborate. On the other hand, if $\phi_i<1$, then agent i should adapt to the changing dynamics of the system and explore independently, whereas those with larger values should collaborate to achieve common goals. We can optimize $\phi$ to ensure fairness across the agents and reduce variance in the learned policies.

More precisely, we train a controller critic network to predict the mix coefficient vector $\hat{\phi}$ from the observation sequence $(o_1^t,\cdots,o_n^t)$, assuming the joint action is already chosen. Since we discretize the action space, we choose $\hat{\phi}_{A_i}=g(\phi_i;\theta)$, where $g$ is a non-linear function such as sigmoid or ReLU, and $\theta$ is a trainable parameter vector. The output of the controller network is then passed through another non-linearity to obtain the actual mixture coefficients $\phi^{\text{final}}=(\phi_1^{\text{final}},\cdots,\phi_n^{\text{final}})^T$. The latter ensures that the entries of $\phi^{\text{final}}$ lie in the range [0,1], while maintaining the relative proportionality defined by $\phi$. 

Given $\phi^{\text{final}}$, we can compute the joint Q-value estimate for each agent as follows: $$\begin{aligned}Q^{\text{joint}}(s,A)=&\sum_{i=1}^{n}\phi_i Q_i(s,A_i)\\&=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\phi_i\left[Q_i(s,A_i)+V^{\text{target}}_i(s)\right]\end{aligned}$$ Where $V^{\text{target}}_i(s)$ denotes the target value function evaluated at state $s$ using the latest parameters from the target networks. This expression guarantees that the mixture weights $\phi$ contribute equally towards the joint Q-value estimation even if some agents perform better than others.

## 3. Policy Gradients
The policy gradients algorithm is usually used to find the best action policy by updating the gradient descent parameters of a parametric policy function $f_\theta(s,a)=Q(s,a;\theta)$ using the observed returns $G_t$. We need to modify this algorithm to accommodate the fact that we now have a joint action space and a mix of agent policies.

First, note that the policy gradient update rule given by the REINFORCE algorithm is $$g_t\approx\nabla_\theta log \pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)G_t,$$ where $\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)$ is the probability distribution over actions at state $s_t$ given policy parameter $\theta$. By analogy with the above expression, we define the per-agent gradient estimator $\tilde{g}_t^{(i)}=\nabla_\theta Q_i(s_t,A_t;\theta)$ for each agent $i$ as the product of its local policy gradient and the associated mixing coefficient. 

Next, we can apply the chain rule of differentiation to get the overall gradient estimate $\tilde{g}_t=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\tilde{g}_t^{(i)}\phi_i$. We then update the policy parameter $\theta$ using the negative per-agent gradient estimates. Note that the order of updates does not matter here, since we don't explicitly depend on the value function estimate $V^\text{target}_i$ for any of the terms in $\tilde{g}_t$.

Finally, we can simplify the expressions for computing the total reward and advantage, using matrix multiplication notation and conditional expectations: $$R_t=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\phi_i R_{ti}\\J_t=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\phi_i[\hat{Q}_i(s_t,A_t)-b_t]$$where $R_{ti}$ and $\hat{Q}_i(s_t,A_t)$ are the partial returns and predicted Q-values for agent $i$ respectively.
