# 1.简介
  

Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the fastest growing fields in modern society and has been widely applied to multiple areas such as robotics, image processing, natural language processing, speech recognition, etc. In this article, we will implement a neural network from scratch using python programming language by exploring its basic principles and algorithms. This project will help you understand how artificial neural networks work under the hood and learn some key concepts like activation functions, loss function, optimization algorithm, backpropagation, regularization, gradient descent, and hyperparameters tuning.

In order to provide a clear explanation on our article, let's start with some introduction:

1.What is a neural network? 
A neural network is a type of machine learning model that is inspired by the structure and functionality of the human brain. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes called neurons that process input data and generate output results. The connections between these neurons allow them to communicate with each other and apply logic and reasoning processes. These networks are capable of making accurate predictions based on large amounts of data and can be trained through supervised or unsupervised learning techniques.

2.Why do we need a neural network? 

The development of AI has revolutionized various industries such as finance, healthcare, security, transportation, and many more. However, building complex systems using traditional programming languages may not be feasible for real-world applications due to their high complexity. Therefore, AI engineers use specialized software frameworks that simplify the implementation of neural networks. One popular framework used for building neural networks is TensorFlow. 

Neural networks have shown excellent performance in solving different types of problems ranging from image classification to text translation. They are known for being able to automatically extract relevant features from raw data and classify it into categories. Thus, they are becoming an essential tool in today’s world. 

3.Python Programming Language
Python is a versatile and powerful programming language that has become a common choice among developers because of its simplicity, readability, and extensibility. Within just few weeks, anyone can learn Python programming language and master its application by implementing deep learning models. We will use Python programming language throughout this tutorial. If you don't have any experience in programming, I recommend checking out some introductory courses on Python before continuing.


# 2.Basics & Terminologies
Before moving forward, let's briefly cover the fundamental concepts and terminologies associated with neural networks.
2.1 Basics
A neural network is made up of three main components - Input Layer, Hidden Layers, Output Layer. Each layer contains a set of neurons that take inputs from the previous layer and produce outputs to the next layer. There are no direct connections between layers except for the last two layers which connect to the final output. Below is a simple illustration of the concept:


Let's consider an example where there are three input variables x1, x2, and x3 and one output variable y. To build a neural network with one hidden layer having four neurons, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize weights and biases randomly for all neurons and connections within the network. 
2. Feed the input values (x1, x2, x3) to the first layer of neurons. 
3. Apply an activation function on the output of each neuron in the first layer to introduce non-linearity in the system. Let us assume we choose the sigmoid activation function for this purpose.
4. Pass the weighted sum of the output of each neuron in the first layer to the second layer of neurons along with additional bias terms. 
5. Again apply the activation function on the output of each neuron in the second layer to introduce further non-linearity.
6. Finally, combine the outputs from both the hidden layers to obtain the predicted output value y. 

This general approach applies to most neural network architectures including convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks). In this post, we will focus solely on implementing vanilla neural networks i.e., feedforward neural networks without loops or branches.


2.2 Activation Functions
An activation function is a mathematical operation applied to each node of a neural network that introduces non-linearity into the system. Without an activation function, the network would simply perform linear regression on the input data and could not capture non-linear relationships present in the data. Common activation functions include ReLU, softmax, tanh, and sigmoid. 

The sigmoid function squashes the input signal between zero and one, so it is commonly used as an activation function for binary classification tasks or when the output is bounded between 0 and 1. The ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function replaces negative input values with zero, allowing the network to pass only positive signals through. Softmax normalization also involves applying exponential function over the input values followed by normalization to ensure that all values add up to 1. Tanh function works well when the output should fall between -1 and 1 but still captures non-linearity well enough for most practical purposes. Here is the equation for sigmoid activation function:

f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))  

Here's a visualization of the sigmoid function:


And here is the code snippet to plot the sigmoid function in Python:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1/(1+np.exp(-x))

x = np.linspace(-10, 10, num=100)
y = sigmoid(x)

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.xlabel('Input')
plt.ylabel('Output')
plt.title('Sigmoid Function')
plt.show()
```
