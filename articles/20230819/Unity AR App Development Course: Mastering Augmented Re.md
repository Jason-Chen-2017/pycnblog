# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology 
## Camera Views and Tracking Markers
A typical augmented reality app uses a combination of two or more cameras to capture imagery around the user’s device. One of these cameras captures the visual information of the real world, while another displays the virtual content created by the developer. The resulting output is merged to create an immersive environment, complete with the digital items placed overtop. However, before we dive deep into the implementation details, let’s clarify some key terms and concepts related to camera views and marker tracking.  

### Cameras  
Cameras are devices that record and transmit digital images or video signals. They produce images in real time based on inputs such as light, motion, or sound. An augmented reality app typically requires both front and rear-facing cameras to capture the user’s environment accurately. Front-facing cameras capture the visible part of the environment, while back-facing cameras capture the environment behind the viewer. Apart from capturing images, each camera also produces other data such as depth maps or color tracks, which can be useful for augmented reality purposes.


### Marker Tracking 
Marker tracking refers to the process of mapping out the positions of fiducial markers in the real world and placing those markers virtually in the same locations within the augmented reality space. Fiducial markers are small objects or graphics that encode identifying information about the physical objects they are attached to. For example, QR codes, barcodes, and NFC tags can serve as fiducial markers in augmented reality applications. Once the markers are mapped, we need to track their movement throughout the real world so that we can synchronize the virtual objects with the real ones. In order to accomplish this, several algorithms are commonly used, including Optical Flow, Visual Odometry, Particle Filters, Kalman Filters and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).


### Scene Representation and Object Placement 
The first step towards building an augmented reality application involves defining the layout and appearance of the virtual environment. Here, we assume that there exists a pre-existing digital model of the real-world environment containing geometric primitives such as planes, cubes, cylinders, spheres, etc., and their corresponding texture assets. These models can either be provided directly by the developer or generated automatically using computer vision algorithms or machine learning models. Once the geometry and textures are defined, we can move onto deciding how to represent these models in the augmented reality environment.

To ensure that the virtual objects maintain the correct proportions and orientation in relation to the user, we can use a variety of techniques such as Plane Alignment, Surface Normal Estimation, and Homography Transformation. To handle occlusion, we can use Alpha Blending or Transparency Masking. Lastly, if needed, we can incorporate physics simulations and natural-looking interactions between virtual objects and the real world. 

Once the scene is set up, we proceed to selecting and placing the objects that we want to appear in the real world. There are three main approaches to object placement:

1. Flat Object Placement – In flat object placement mode, we simply project the virtual objects onto the floor or walls of the environment. 
2. Anchor Point Placement – In anchor point placement mode, we specify points in the real world where we want the virtual objects to attach themselves.
3. Image-Based Placement – In image-based placement mode, we extract features from the captured images and match them against predefined templates or references. 

Here’s an illustration of how these placement modes work:
 


## Location Services and Raycasting Techniques
Location-based services play a crucial role in building augmented reality applications. We need to access geographical location data to determine the current coordinates of the user’s device and enable us to retrieve nearby content or offer recommendations. Some common location-based services include GPS (Global Positioning System), NFC (Near Field Communication), Wi-Fi Positioning, Bluetooth Beacons and Geofencing.

GPS relies on satellites orbiting the Earth and emitting radio waves that continuously update the receiver’s position. On Android phones and tablets, we usually rely on built-in APIs to get the current GPS fix. iOS devices require special permission to access the GPS sensor. 

NFC stands for Near Field Communication, which is a low power wireless communication protocol used in the NFC chipsets integrated in mobile phones and tablets. It provides reliable, secure and fast communication between mobile devices, even when separated by many meters. With the aid of an NFC reader, we can read and write NFC tags that contain metadata about places, people, or things that we wish to share. 

WiFi positioning systems detect nearby Wi-Fi networks and calculate their approximate distance, signal strength and location relative to the device. While accurate, these systems are limited to short range communications only and can often lead to poor accuracy when far away from the access point. Furthermore, they can interfere with existing cellular data connections, leading to bandwidth wastage. 

Bluetooth Beacons, similar to WiFi positioning, are little blue dots embedded inside objects or vehicles. They send regular broadcast messages that provide valuable contextual information about their surrounding area, enabling apps to locate them quickly without relying on centralized servers. Geofencing enables developers to define areas of interest and restrict certain actions such as advertising or navigation until the user leaves the defined zone.

Raycasting is a technique used in augmented reality to interact with real-world surfaces such as walls, floors or doors. When we cast rays from the center of our device towards any surface, we receive a reading indicating whether there is anything blocking the path. If there is no obstruction, we know that we are pointing at something and can trigger some action. Common raycasting techniques include plane detection, mesh rendering, UV Texture mapping, and Physically Based Rendering (PBR).



# 3. Core Algorithms and Operations
Now that we have understood the underlying concepts and terminology associated with AR technology, we can start looking at the actual technical specifications and procedures involved in building a simple augmented reality application using Unity. Specifically, we will focus on the following aspects:

1. Creating Virtual Objects
We will learn how to import 3D models and materials into Unity and manipulate them using various transformations and animation techniques. We will also understand how to assign physical properties to objects, such as mass, velocity, drag and gravity, and simulate collision effects. 

2. Manipulating Objects
We will learn how to programmatically control objects in Unity using scripts. We will also explore different types of object manipulation, such as free-form selection and constraint-based manipulation. We will learn how to select objects and perform operations such as scaling, rotation, translation and clipping using scripting.

3. Working with Multiple Cameras
We will study different ways to render virtual objects onto multiple cameras simultaneously. We will also understand how to adjust camera parameters such as field of view, lens distortion and clipping planes to optimize the final result.

4. Handling Input Events
We will learn how to detect user gestures and touch screen inputs in Unity, and react appropriately. We will also learn how to respond to clicks, drags, swipes and taps in 3D space using raycasting and cursor interaction.

5. Improving Performance
We will learn tips and tricks to improve the frame rate of our augmented reality application, such as minimizing draw calls and optimizing asset files. We will also review techniques to reduce memory usage, such as LOD (Level Of Detail) and memory pooling.

6. Integration with Third Party SDKs
We will explore different options for integrating additional functionality into our augmented reality application, such as integrating external 3D libraries or image recognition capabilities. We will also consider security concerns, such as avoiding unauthorized access to sensitive information or processing.

Last but not least, we will conclude the article by discussing best practices for designing and implementing augmented reality apps, and addressing common issues that developers may encounter during the process.
