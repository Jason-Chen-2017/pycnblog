# 1.简介
  

Blockchain technologies are transforming the way we store, exchange, transfer and process digital assets. They offer a significant potential for creating new business models that enable the decentralization of economic activity across borders and geographies. However, they also present unique security challenges that need to be addressed by blockchain developers, governance bodies, regulators and institutional players alike. 

In this article, we will discuss the importance of authentication and authorization mechanisms in securing the blockchain infrastructure. We will describe how blockchains can be secured using these mechanisms such as digital signatures, access control lists (ACLs), user-based permissions or role-based access controls. Additionally, we will explore the current state of industry-wide adoption of authentication and authorization techniques used in blockchain systems and identify emerging threats and vulnerabilities associated with them. Finally, we will discuss future directions and considerations for improving blockchain security. Overall, our objective is to provide practical knowledge and insights on the topic of secure blockchain infrastructure design, implementation and operations.

# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before diving into technical details about blockchain security, let's first define some basic concepts and terminology.

 - User: Any entity who interacts with the system, whether it is an individual or an organization. Users may range from consumers, businesses, government agencies or even anonymous users interacting through smart contracts on the blockchain.
 
 - Node: A server running the consensus algorithm responsible for validating transactions and ensuring the integrity of the network. It stores the public key and other relevant information required for validating transactions. There are various types of nodes, including full nodes, light nodes and archive nodes.

 - Consensus Algorithm: The mechanism by which the nodes agree on the order in which transactions are added to the ledger. In traditional distributed ledgers like Bitcoin, consensus algorithms ensure that all participants follow the same rules when making updates to the shared database. 

 - Transaction: An update made to the ledger that records a change in the state of the network. Transactions contain data such as the sender’s address, recipient’s address, amount transferred, timestamp and signature generated based on the sender’s private key. 

 - Ledger: A shared global record of all the transactions that have occurred on the blockchain. Each node keeps its own copy of the ledger, but every participant agrees on one common version of the ledger called the chain. The chain is made up of blocks of transactions, which are grouped together to form a contiguous piece of the chain.

 - Block: A collection of transactions bundled together into a single unit of work. Blocks are created every few minutes and added to the end of the chain. When a miner mines a block, he creates several transactions and includes them in the block before broadcasting the result to the rest of the network.

Now that you have understood the basics, let's move to the next section where we will discuss different types of blockchain security mechanisms.

# 3.Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms in Blockchain Systems
## Digital Signatures
Digital signatures are a widely adopted approach for authenticating entities involved in blockchain systems. These signatures prove the identity of individuals or organizations while ensuring that the data has not been tampered with during transmission or storage. The most popular digital signature scheme used today is the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) proposed by NIST in 2009.

The ECDSA involves two elliptical curves (secp256k1, P-256, etc.) and two random numbers known as "private keys" and "public keys". Private keys are kept secret, whereas public keys can be exchanged publicly. To sign a message, a sender generates a hash value of the message using a cryptographic hash function, then combines the message hash with his/her private key, applies a certain mathematical operation on the result to generate a signature, and finally transmits both the message and signature along with their corresponding public keys over an unsecured channel. Receivers use the receiver’s public key to verify the signature and confirm that the sender was indeed the source of the message.

Using digital signatures helps establish trust between participants and protect against man-in-the-middle attacks where the attacker intercepts messages transmitted through the network without being detected by the original sender.

## Access Control Lists (ACLs)
Access control lists (ACLs) allow fine-grained control over the permissions granted to specific users. ACLs typically consist of a list of allowed IP addresses, usernames and roles that correspond to each set of permissions assigned to those identities. 

When a client connects to a blockchain application via HTTPS, the web server checks the client's IP address against the ACL and allows or denies access accordingly. This method of controlling access to resources can be useful when dealing with sensitive data stored on a blockchain platform. However, since clients connect directly to the servers hosting the blockchain application, they do not necessarily have the ability to authenticate themselves within the context of the blockchain itself.

To further enhance security in blockchain applications, wallet providers can integrate third-party authentication services such as Google Authenticator or Apple Pay for additional layer of protection. Using multi-factor authentication ensures that only authorized parties can access protected resources, regardless of their connection method or location.

## User-Based Permissions and Role-Based Access Controls
User-based permission systems rely on assigning individual user accounts with specific privileges and authorizations. For example, a banking application might assign a read-only account level to customers, giving them access to view transaction history and balance, but no authority to withdraw funds. Similarly, a healthcare application could grant insurance companies read-only access to patients' medical records, allowing them to track their progression through treatment and schedule appointments, but deny them administrative privileges to modify patient records or create new policies. 

Role-based access controls (RBAC) are more complex than simple user-based access controls because they involve grouping users into predefined roles according to their responsibilities and the actions they should be permitted to perform. RBAC requires defining roles, providing permissions to each role, and mapping users to roles based on their job title, department, team membership, or any other applicable criteria. With RBAC, multiple roles can be assigned to a single user depending on their position or level of responsibility within an enterprise, resulting in greater flexibility and scalability in managing access control policies.

However, implementing RBAC poses a challenge due to the dynamic nature of blockchain networks. In addition to organizing members into roles dynamically, users must continuously monitor changes in the role definitions and apply appropriate permissions to maintain the overall security posture. Compromised credentials or privilege escalation events can pose serious risks if proper monitoring and auditing practices are not followed. Moreover, there is always a risk that poorly defined roles can open up access to sensitive data and functionality without fully understanding the purpose of the system or the intended use case. Therefore, although RBAC is a powerful tool for managing access control policies in blockchain systems, it requires careful planning and implementation to mitigate the possible risks.

## Current State of Industry-Wide Adoption of Authentication and Authorization Techniques Used in Blockchain Systems
As mentioned earlier, blockchains are highly centralized systems that rely heavily on strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect the network from unauthorized access and transactions. While numerous studies exist documenting the effectiveness of various authentication and authorization schemes in protecting blockchain infrastructures, here are three categories of schemes that are currently gaining widespread adoption in industry:

 - Token-based Authentication: Traditional username and password authentication methods are replaced by tokens issued by external identity providers such as OAuth or OpenID Connect. Tokens can be mapped to specific blockchain addresses or other attributes to authorize access to specific blockchain functions. Common examples include MetaMask and Argent X, which issue ERC-20 compatible tokenized versions of Ethereum accounts for mobile app usage.

 - Key Management Services: Instead of relying solely on human intervention for key management, cloud service providers offer managed HSM solutions that support encryption, signing, and verification operations. One such solution offered by AWS CloudHSM is capable of generating hardware-protected keys using FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certification.

 - Multi-Factor Authentication: With increasing popularity of mobile devices and convenient access to blockchain platforms, MFA can become an essential component of user authentication procedures. Many blockchain-focused MFA providers now offer features like push notifications, time-based OTPs or biometric-based authentication options.

Overall, it is critical for blockchain developers, policy makers, financial institutions and technology vendors to understand the pros and cons of different authentication and authorization schemes when designing and deploying blockchain systems. Implementing best practices for securing blockchain infrastructure requires balancing the tradeoffs between convenience, usability, and security, as well as staying abreast of the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape.
