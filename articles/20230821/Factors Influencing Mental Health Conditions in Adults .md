# 1.简介
  

Mental health is a critical public health issue that affects millions of individuals and can have serious consequences on their physical, mental or social wellbeing. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) defines mental health as "the state of being aware of one's own and others' feelings, thoughts, and behaviours and their capacity to cope with them effectively." It highlights the importance of early intervention programs targeting both psychological and physical factors contributing to mental illness. Research has shown that such prevention efforts can prevent substantial morbidity and mortality due to mental disorders among adults over 65 years old. Despite these benefits, there are several factors that contribute to mental health challenges in this age group. This study aims to identify and explore potential factors influencing mental health conditions among adults over 65 years old using multimodal data analytics techniques.

## 2.1. Definitions
- **Multimodal:** Multimodal refers to information that comes from different sources at once, which provides us insights into complex patterns and relationships between variables. Examples include audiovisual data, textual data, cognitive assessment tools like EQ-5D scores, and wearable devices like Apple Watch and Fitbit. 

- **Cognition assessment tools:** Cognition assessment tools help us measure various mental abilities like attention, memory, reasoning, language processing, etc., which can indicate how well someone functions in certain ways. There are many types of cognition assessment tools available, including EQ-5D scores, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRIs). These tools provide valuable insights into people’s mental processes and behaviors. 

- **Behavior patterns:** Behavior patterns describe what kind of activities an individual engages in during his/her day. We can use behavior pattern analysis to understand the way individuals interact and communicate within their lives. For instance, identifying patterns of frequent alcohol consumption can help diagnose depressive symptoms. Similarly, we can analyze personality traits associated with success in school, workplace, leisure time activity, etc. to identify predictors of mental health challenges.  

## 2.2. Taxonomy of factors affecting mental health in adults over 65: 

1. Physical factors: These factors involve factors related to our bodies, such as diet, exercise regimen, stress level, and lifestyle choices.

2. Social factors: These factors involve factors related to our interactions with other people, family members, friends, and neighbours. They may range from positive interactions with loved ones to negative peer pressure or hostility.

3. Environmental factors: These factors refer to factors outside of our control, such as natural disasters, external threats, pollution, and global warming.

4. Genetic factors: These factors are present even before birth and may impact our development and functioning. 

5. Mental factors: These factors refer to internal factors that influence our mind and emotions. They can range from mood disorders, schizophrenia, ADHD, depression, OCD, and eating disorders. 

6. Clinical factors: These factors occur more frequently after acute cases of mental illness where specialists visit to treat them. They may involve medication management, treatment options, access to psychiatrist, and mental health care providers.

7. Behavioral factors: These factors reflect people’s coping mechanisms when they face life events, such as job loss, divorce, and bereavement. Behaviors also play a role in shaping our thought process, making it easier for us to think critically about problems and difficult decisions.

8. Lifestyle factors: These factors refer to the habits, routines, and values that define who we are as individuals. Personal beliefs, attitudes, and values shape our viewpoints, preferences, and actions.

9. Technology factors: Technologies are transforming the way we live, learn, and work. Although new technologies offer convenience and ease of access, they can also lead to obesity, weight gain, increased risk of diseases, and decreased motivation.
