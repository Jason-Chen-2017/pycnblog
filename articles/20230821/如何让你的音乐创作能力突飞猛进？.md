# 1.简介
  

自从诞生于十九世纪初的古典音乐体裁，传统音乐已经成为西方民族文化的一部分。在中国，无论是在历史还是现实，都无法想象没有古典音乐的年代。它的影响力之大远超过其周边文化、风俗习惯甚至宗教信仰。近几年，随着电子技术的发展，各类艺术家纷纷尝试用数字技术来创作音乐，例如虚拟歌手VOS、Sony Vegas Pro等。

然而，如何通过数字技术生成具有独创性的艺术作品却一直是一个难题。在过去几年里，音频、视频领域都有了长足的发展，数字音乐技术也随之发展壮大。据统计，截至2019年，国内数字音乐产业规模达到每年10亿元左右，占全球数字音乐市场的七成以上。

因此，如何通过数字技术创造出具有独创性的音乐作品，无疑是很多音乐爱好者追求的目标。但是，由于人脑的计算能力限制，即使是最高水平的算法也难以完全复制人类的创ativity。

因此，对音乐创作能力的提升，要靠多种途径，其中之一就是学习更多的古典曲目、学习创作方法、了解古典音乐理论及其发展脉络、积累有关音乐史、器材设备、音乐知识等相关知识。只有充分地利用这些知识资源，才能真正掌握并提升自己的音乐创作能力。

本文将为你提供一些关于如何提升你的音乐创作能力的方法。希望能够帮助你不断提升自己音乐创作的能力，让你的音乐作品更加出色！


# 2.基本概念、术语及定义
## 2.1 概念
### 2.1.1 音乐
Music is a subset of human creative activity that involves the creation and study of sounds or tone-like vibrations through various methods including instrumental, vocal, dance, choral, singing, reading, drawing, painting, playing musical notation, gestural movement, and imitation. Music has been used as a source of entertainment, education, communication, exercise, therapy, medicine, psychology, and research in history, philosophy, art, linguistics, music theory, science, industry, and many other fields.

### 2.1.2 音符（Note）
A single pitch sound consisting of an individual element (pitch), such as a sine wave, square wave, sawtooth wave, or triangle wave with amplitude modulation applied to it by volume controls. In western music, notes are usually represented on a staff of two lines, where each line represents one octave above middle C (C4). Notes can be classified into common types such as tones, sharps, flats, quintups, sextups, naturals, octaves, etc., according to their relationship to each other and their harmonization.

### 2.1.3 拍子（Rhythm）
The regular repetitive pattern of beats and pauses between them that together create a melody or tune. Rhythms typically incorporate elements from Western popular music, such as swing, runners, measures, dotted notes, triplets, quadripes, sixteenth notes, eighth notes, quarter notes, half notes, whole notes, and breve notes.

### 2.1.4 和弦（Chord）
A combination of three or more pitches played simultaneously in varying intensities and timbres. They have both spatial and temporal dimensions, which combine to produce a specific effect on listeners. Common types of chords include majors, minors, augmented, diminished, suspended, dominant, and triads. The key signature determines whether the root note of the scale is either the first fifth below middle C (C4) or the third fifth above middle C.

### 2.1.5 模式（Pattern）
A recurring sequence of events arranged in a structured manner, often based on principles of rhythm and structure found in Western popular music. Examples of patterns include motifs, themes, arpeggios, moods, guitar chords, and lead sheets. Patterns can vary in tempo, rhythm, timbre, dynamics, and form.

### 2.1.6 节奏（Tempo）
The speed at which the musician plays his/her melody, chord progression, or piece. Tempos range from very slow (slowest 40 beats per minute) to very fast (fastest 300 beats per minute). Different tempi can be created using different techniques like counterpoint, diatonic analysis, and chronogramming.

### 2.1.7 音轨（Track）
Any distinct section or layer within any audio file, containing its own unique set of digital samples representing analog signal variations over time. For example, one track may contain audio data for a song's vocals while another contains audio data for a song's drums. 

### 2.1.8 MIDI（Musical Instrument Digital Interface）
A standardized protocol for exchanging musical control messages between electronic musical instruments and computers. It defines how digital signals should be interpreted by these devices so that they can work together effectively.

### 2.1.9 AI（Artificial Intelligence）
An intelligent system inspired by the way the human brain works, capable of making decisions, reasoning, learning, and problem solving on its own without being explicitly programmed to do so. There are several branches of AI: machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, game playing, and decision-making.

### 2.1.10 生成模型（Generative Model）
A model that learns to generate new examples that appear similar to the training dataset. This type of model uses statistical algorithms like neural networks, Markov chains, and grammars to create novel combinations of input features. One application of generative models is creating images, videos, and music.

### 2.1.11 演绎推理（Deduction and Induction）
Two important approaches to building mathematical knowledge, involving inference rules derived from observations rather than directly specified axioms. Deduction is based on deductive logic, where premises are connected through logical steps to reach conclusions. Induction is based on empirical evidence gathered from cases and generalizations about the world, and infers general principles from instances.
