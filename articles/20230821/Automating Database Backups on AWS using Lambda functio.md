In recent years cloud computing has emerged as a new way of running software services. With the rise in popularity and ease-of-use of cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), developers have started taking advantage of this platform to deploy their applications quickly, easily and at lower costs than before. In the same vein, cloud vendors offer database services for use cases like data warehousing, analytics or caching purposes. As organizations are moving towards microservices architecture where each service is deployed independently, managing backups becomes critical especially when dealing with mission-critical databases. 

Database backups play an essential role in ensuring business continuity by providing recovery points that can be used to restore the system to a specific point in time in case of any disruption. However, creating regular backups manually is cumbersome, error prone and takes significant time. To automate backup creation process, we need to implement it using serverless architectures so that resources are automatically provisioned, scaled based on demand and cost effectiveness ensured. This blog post describes how to create automated database backups using AWS Lambda functions which can help save valuable time and reduce manual effort involved in database backup management.  

This article assumes that you have some knowledge about AWS Lambda functions, IAM roles, API Gateway endpoints and SNS topics. If not, I recommend reading through these concepts first before proceeding further. Additionally, make sure that your development environment includes Node.js runtime environment along with other required tools. You will also need access to a valid AWS account to follow through this tutorial.


# 2.背景介绍
Today's modern enterprise environments involve complex systems with multiple layers of automation and integration. These systems must rely on well-defined interfaces to communicate with external entities like customers, suppliers, partners etc. One common interface used in such scenarios is RESTful web APIs. When designing a cloud-based solution, it is important to choose appropriate architectural patterns like microservices and event-driven architecture to enable scalability, resiliency and maintainability. Among many benefits of implementing this approach, one key aspect relates to better fault tolerance and reduced downtime during failures. One of the core components in any cloud-native application is its database layer. Each service typically interacts with a dedicated database instance to store and retrieve data efficiently. Therefore, backup management plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and availability of the data stored within the databases. Cloud providers provide various options for backing up databases including automatic scheduled backups or manual backups initiated by users. Of course, these approaches do not guarantee continuous backup retention but they help minimize risks associated with human errors or malicious activities.

When deploying database backups using traditional methods, backup operators spend considerable amount of time performing ad hoc tasks, often resulting in incomplete backups due to hardware failures or interruptions. Moreover, since there may be several copies of the data across different locations, restoration from backups requires special attention from both technical and administrative personnel. Hence, automating backup creation process helps avoid these issues altogether while reducing overall operational overhead.

Traditional database backup solutions usually include two main steps: storage optimization and scheduling. Storage optimization involves optimizing disk space usage, removing unused files and compressing frequently accessed files to improve efficiency and manageability. Scheduling involves setting policies to back up the database periodically or according to certain events like user activity or system failure. All of these operations require a lot of manual intervention, making them impractical for large-scale deployments with numerous databases. 

To address these challenges, cloud vendors introduced various managed database backup solutions like RDS Multi-AZ replicas or DynamoDB Global Tables. These solutions offer automatic and transparent replication of the data across regions without the need for explicit interaction from the backup operator. They also provide cross region failover capabilities for disaster recovery needs. Nevertheless, these solutions still depend on third party services like EBS Snapshots or S3 buckets and are subject to vendor lock-in. Their primary focus is always on low latency, high availability, security and compliance aspects and cannot meet all the requirements of mission-critical databases.

However, AWS offers another option called AWS Lambda functions. AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service offered by AWS that allows us to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It provides a pay per use pricing model and scales automatically based on traffic volume. We can write our own custom logic inside lambda functions and execute them whenever triggered by various events or schedules. Using AWS Lambda functions, we can build custom workflows to perform automated database backups.

In summary, if we want to achieve consistent and reliable backups of mission-critical databases, we need to use AWS Lambda functions as they offer automatic scaling, pay-per-use pricing model and built-in integrations with various AWS services like S3, DynamoDB, Cloudwatch, Route53, IAM etc. These features make AWS Lambda ideal for building automated backup workflows that span across multiple AWS services and deliver consistent and reliable results.
