# 1.简介
  

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a robust cloud platform for hosting machine learning models and services. In this article we will see how to host your machine learning model or algorithm on the AWS platform through an API by utilizing Amazon's Lambda service. We will use Python language to develop our code examples but any programming languages can be used with minimal modifications in the process of deployment. 

By following these steps you will learn:

1. How to create an Amazon S3 bucket where your trained machine learning model files are stored.
2. How to train your machine learning model using Python libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
3. How to package your machine learning model into a Docker container and deploy it on AWS Lambda using serverless architecture.
4. Finally, how to expose your deployed API endpoint using HTTPS protocol so that clients can access it securely. 


This article assumes basic knowledge of Python, Machine Learning and Docker. Familiarity with Amazon Web Services is helpful but not required. If you need further assistance in understanding some concepts mentioned in this article please refer to their documentation.

# 2. Basic Concepts & Terminology
Before diving deep into deploying machine learning models as APIs using AWS Lambda, let’s first understand the basic concepts and terminology used. Let me quickly summarize them here before proceeding forward.

## 2.1. What is Serverless Architecture?
Serverless architecture refers to a cloud computing model in which applications are hosted by a third-party provider instead of being hosted directly on servers owned and managed by the developer. This means that there are no dedicated hardware resources assigned to running the application; rather, they are provisioned automatically based on demand, ensuring scalability without requiring significant upfront infrastructure costs. The key advantage of serverless architectures is cost optimization, as the provider handles all the software management tasks like scaling, patching, backups etc., resulting in savings in both time and money compared to traditional IT infrastructures.

## 2.2. What is Amazon Lambda?
Amazon Lambda is a serverless compute service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows developers to write functions – called “Lambda functions” – in various programming languages that can be executed when needed by the system. These functions run within a virtual environment and have a predefined execution duration, after which they are terminated and reclaimed by the system. Functions can also trigger other AWS services, such as Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, or Amazon API Gateway, making them particularly useful for integrating with backend systems. One important feature of Lambda is its ability to scale automatically, enabling developers to focus on writing business logic and leaving the plumbing to the service provider.

## 2.3. What is Amazon API Gateway?
Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to publish, maintain, monitor, and secure RESTful, WebSocket, and HTTP APIs at any scale. Using API Gateway, developers can create RESTful APIs that act as backends for mobile and web apps, microservices, IoT devices, and more, all securing access via AWS IAM permissions and authentication mechanisms. Additionally, API Gateway offers features like caching, rate limiting, and usage monitoring to help developers manage their APIs efficiently.

## 2.4. What is Amazon S3 Bucket?
Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is object storage built to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere. Developers can use buckets to store machine learning model files, images, videos, log files, etc. They offer multiple pricing plans to meet different needs. For example, customers pay only for what they use, rather than committing to long-term capacity purchases. 

## 2.5. What is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)?
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides reliable, secure, and resizable compute capacity in the AWS cloud. Customers can launch EC2 instances to build highly available and scalable applications. Each instance contains a full operating system plus preconfigured software, allowing developers to install any necessary packages. There are several options for selecting the type and size of instance based on requirements.

## 2.6. What is Dockerfile?
A Dockerfile is a text file containing a set of instructions that specify how a docker image should be created. It describes the base image, packages that should be installed, ports to expose, volumes to mount, and commands to execute during runtime. By building a Dockerfile, developers can create custom images that contain specific components or tools needed for their machine learning models.

## 2.7. What is Docker Container?
Docker containers wrap around individual applications and their dependencies, making them easier to move between environments and simplifying their deployment. Containers share the same kernel and therefore use fewer resources than virtual machines. They start faster because they don't need to boot an entire operating system, reducing overhead. Containers can easily be stopped and started, making them ideal for continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.

# 3. Core Algorithm and Technical Details
In order to successfully deploy a machine learning model as an API using AWS Lambda, we need to follow certain technical guidelines and procedures. Below I will explain each step in detail along with the relevant Python libraries used. Here is an overview of the steps involved:

1. Create an Amazon S3 bucket
Firstly, we need to create an Amazon S3 bucket where our trained machine learning model files will be uploaded. You can create one manually or automate the creation using the boto3 library in Python.

2. Train your machine learning model
Next, we need to train our machine learning model using Python libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Since training models requires large amounts of memory, we may want to choose GPU-enabled instances to reduce training times. 

3. Package your machine learning model into a Docker container
We then need to package our trained machine learning model into a Docker container. A Docker container wraps around an application and its dependencies, making them easier to transport and deploy. The Dockerfile specifies the steps to build the image and defines the entry point command to start the application inside the container. Once the container is built, we can push it to an Amazon ECR repository for deployment later.

4. Deploy your Docker container on AWS Lambda
Finally, we can deploy our Docker container on AWS Lambda using serverless architecture. To do this, we need to create an AWS Lambda function and configure it to connect to our S3 bucket where our model files are located, invoke the API Gateway URL to receive incoming requests, download the latest model weights and serve predictions back to client requests.

Here is a summary of the above steps:

1. Upload Trained Model Files: First, we need to upload our trained machine learning model files to an Amazon S3 bucket.
2. Install Required Libraries: Next, we need to install the appropriate Python libraries to train our machine learning model, including TensorFlow or PyTorch.
3. Write Code to Train Model: Then, we need to write code to train the machine learning model, passing in hyperparameters and loading data. We can save the trained model weights locally or upload them to S3 depending on our preference.
4. Build Docker Image: After training the model, we need to build a Docker image using the provided Dockerfile. This Dockerfile specifies the steps to build the image and define the entry point command to start the application inside the container.
5. Push Docker Image to ECR Repository: Next, we need to push the Docker image to an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository for future deployments. Alternatively, we could pull the existing image from another repository if it has already been built and pushed.
6. Configure AWS Lambda Function: Now that we have our Docker image saved to an ECR repository, we can create an AWS Lambda function and configure it to connect to our S3 bucket, invoke the API Gateway URL to receive incoming requests, download the latest model weights and serve predictions back to client requests.

Let's now dive deeper into each of these steps in more detail. 

# 4. Step 1 - Creating an Amazon S3 Bucket
Creating an Amazon S3 bucket is fairly straightforward. However, since it involves billing, make sure to carefully consider your budget before creating a new bucket. Here are the general steps:

1. Sign into your AWS account.
2. Go to the "Services" menu and select "S3".
3. Click "Create bucket."
4. Enter a unique name for your bucket.
5. Choose the region where you would like to host your bucket.
6. Choose whether you want your bucket to be public or private. Public buckets can be accessed over the internet while private buckets require special permissions to access.
7. Review the settings and click "Create bucket." 
8. Confirm the creation of the bucket by clicking the refresh button next to "Buckets" in the left navigation pane. The newly created bucket will appear under "Buckets" with a status of "Creation completed."
