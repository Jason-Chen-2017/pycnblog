Spatial sampling is one of the most critical steps in many point cloud processing tasks such as reconstruction, segmentation and recognition. It determines which points are sampled from a given dataset to be further processed or analyzed by algorithms. This article will review spatial aware sampling techniques that use spatial information encoded in point clouds to selectively extract specific regions of interest (ROI) from the data. These ROIs can then be used for various applications including object detection, semantic segmentation, scene understanding, etc., depending on the purpose of the algorithm being applied. 

The primary objective of this work is to provide an overview of existing spatial aware sampling techniques and identify their strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, it will also discuss related works that build upon these methods and highlight future research opportunities. Finally, we will demonstrate how spatial aware sampling can benefit several computer vision applications through case studies using both synthetic and real-world data sets.

Spatial sampling refers to the process of selecting a subset of representative points from a given dataset. In general, there are three types of spatial sampling techniques based on different criteria:

1. Random Sampling - In random sampling, all available points are randomly selected with equal probability to form the sample set. 

2. Clustering Based Sampling - The data is clustered into groups according to some criteria such as density or distance between points and only those clusters are included in the sample set.

3. Region-based Sampling - Points within predefined regions like rectangles, cubes, spheres, etc. are included in the sample set.

Point cloud processing is often considered a precursor to other geometric representations such as meshes and voxel grids. To convert point clouds to higher dimensional objects, mesh decimation, simplification and dilation can be performed. Similarly, traditional image processing approaches can also be adapted to operate directly on point clouds to produce high quality results. Common applications of point cloud processing include object recognition, mapping, tracking and simulation.

In order to perform accurate object detection and segmentation, various machine learning models have been proposed. One common approach involves extracting local features such as keypoints, surface normals, edges, curvatures from point clouds and applying classification and regression techniques to learn the underlying structure of the data. Other approaches involve constructing deep neural networks or CNNs that take input from point clouds directly.

Recent advancements in deep learning have made significant progress towards achieving state-of-the-art performance for various object recognition tasks, such as image classification and object detection. However, they still rely heavily on annotated datasets and require careful preprocessing steps before feeding them into the model. Therefore, it remains a challenge to apply these advanced models to point clouds without relying on annotations or ground truth.  

Other popular spatial sampling techniques include farthest point sampling (FPS), poisson disk sampling, k-d tree sampling and grid sampling. FPS selects points far away from each other while ensuring that all remaining points are sufficiently dense to reconstruct the entire shape accurately. Poisson disk sampling generates samples according to the minimum distance between any two samples. K-d trees are commonly used to partition point clouds and quickly locate nearby neighbors during inference. Grid sampling divides space into regular grids and selects points that fall inside certain cells to generate uniform coverage across the area.

There exist many variants and modifications of these sampling techniques, ranging from supervised clustering techniques to unsupervised ones that rely solely on geometry constraints. Nevertheless, there has not been much investigation into combining multiple sampling techniques together to improve the overall efficiency of point cloud processing. This is particularly challenging since the goal of spatial sampling is to reduce computational cost and increase accuracy at the same time, but oversampling might cause loss of important details due to reduced precision.
