# 1.简介
  

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables an agent to learn how to take actions in an environment and maximize rewards over time. The goal of RL algorithms is to find the optimal policy which maximizes the cumulative reward while satisfying the constraints imposed by the problem. However, most real-world problems have sparse reward functions, i.e., only a few actions lead to significant rewards. In such cases, it becomes challenging to learn good policies with standard reinforcement learning algorithms. Therefore, we propose a novel algorithm called SARSA(lambda), which can effectively handle sparse reward functions through non-parametric function approximation techniques. We also discuss the potential drawbacks of using neural networks for state representation and exploration in reinforcement learning tasks, where existing exploration methods tend to be suboptimal or even degenerate as they fail to explore sufficiently around the current policy's decision boundary. Finally, we summarize our key findings on the performance of this algorithm compared to other popular methods like Q-learning and actor-critic approaches.

本文主要介绍了一种新型基于SARSA(lambda)算法的稀疏奖励函数非线性变换方法，该算法能够有效处理具有稀疏奖励功能的问题。我们认为，在现实世界中存在大量的非平凡问题，这些问题都具有稀疏的奖励函数，即只有少数动作会产生重大的回报。因此，为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种新的SARSA(lambda)算法，它通过非参数化函数逼近技术有效地处理稀疏奖励函数。此外，本文还讨论了强化学习任务中神经网络状态表示和探索方法的潜在缺陷，特别是在探索方面，当前的方法往往不充分探索周围的决策边界，导致策略性能下降或退化。最后，本文总结了我们关于SARSA(lambda)算法在比其他流行方法比如Q-learning、actor-critic方法更好性能上的主要发现。

本节将回顾一些相关工作，首先是传统的基于值函数的强化学习方法（如Q-learning），其次是基于策略梯度的方法（如PG方法），还有是Actor-Critic方法，它们都试图寻找最优的行为策略，并利用奖励函数来指导策略的更新。但它们都受限于奖励函数的非线性表示，并且可能难以直接应用到稀疏奖励函数上。因此，本文针对稀疏奖励函数设计了一种非线性变换方法，采用了函数逼近的方法进行状态和行为表示，从而可以有效地解决稀疏奖励函数的问题。具体来说，本文将 sarsa(λ) 方法作为基础，采用核方法进行奖励函数的非线性变换，达到从稀疏到密集的非线性映射。这种变换也可以用作许多强化学习问题的特征工程，包括推荐系统、图像识别、机器翻译等领域。

## 3.1 概念
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of AI that enables an agent to learn how to take actions in an environment and maximize rewards over time. It involves an agent interacting with its surroundings and learning from experience to make decisions accordingly. Agents interact with their environments by selecting actions based on their perception of the state and taking those actions to impact the next state. A reward signal is then given based on the agent’s action, which indicates whether the action was effective at achieving the desired outcome or not. 

The main idea behind reinforcement learning is to design agents that can interact with their environments autonomously without any intervention by a human operator. As a result, the agent should be able to select actions that maximize long-term rewards rather than just instantaneous rewards. This requires the agent to learn to balance between exploring new states and exploiting known ones, making decisions based on uncertain information, and avoiding getting stuck in local optima due to erroneous choices. 

Another important concept in reinforcement learning is the Markov decision process (MDP). MDPs are a mathematical framework used to model decision-making processes. An MDP consists of four components:

1. State - The set of all possible states that the system can reach.
2. Action - The set of all possible actions that the agent can choose from each state.
3. Transition probability - Defines the likelihood of moving from one state to another when taking a specific action. 
4. Reward function - Defines the reward achieved after reaching a particular state under a given action. 

Based on these components, an agent learns the value of being in different states and the expected return associated with each action. These values form a policy, which specifies the action that the agent should take in each state to maximize its accumulated reward. The process of finding the optimal policy is often referred to as the “reinforcement” part of the problem. Once the policy has been learned, the agent can begin acting within the environment to achieve its goals. 

There exist several types of reinforcement learning problems including sequential decision making, multi-agent systems, planning, and robotics. We will focus on single-agent reinforcement learning here.
