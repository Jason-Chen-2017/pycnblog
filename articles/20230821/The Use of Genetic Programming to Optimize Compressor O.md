Compressor operations can be optimized for improved pressure performance and reduced costs. Efficiency improvements in compressors are achieved by selecting the most efficient arrangement of components during compression, often based on factors such as component temperature or rotational speed. However, optimizing these operations requires expertise in mechanical engineering and is difficult even for experienced engineers due to their complexity and interdependency among different components. In this paper, we use genetic programming (GP) algorithms to optimize a selection of four common compressor stages: bypass ducts, pre-compressor, turbine, and bypass flow-splitters. We show that GP techniques provide significant improvements over baseline design parameters and achieve better balance between efficiency gains and cost reductions. Furthermore, we propose an optimization strategy using multiple objectives that considers multiple aspects of operation, including energy consumption, operational time, heat dissipation, and noise emissions. These results suggest that GP can be an effective technique for optimizing complex process sequences with multiple conflicting objective functions. Additionally, GP provides a flexible framework for identifying suitable solutions without requiring detailed knowledge about each individual component or stage. This paper demonstrates how GP can enable decision makers to automate and optimize key compressor operations at scale.

Genetic programming (GP) is a type of metaheuristic algorithm developed to find optimal solutions to problems that exhibit complex characteristics such as many constraints, large search spaces, and noisy evaluations. It has been applied successfully in various fields ranging from engineering to computer science, finance, and social sciences. In our work, we will introduce some basic concepts of GP and its application in compressor operation optimization.

## Genotype and Phenotype
In GP, individuals are represented as binary strings called chromosomes that encode the alleles used to construct the phenotype. Each gene in the chromosome corresponds to a parameter in the phenotype. For example, in the context of compressor operation optimization, the length, diameter, material properties, and arrangement of various components comprising a particular compressor stage constitute the genotype. The corresponding set of values determined by the combination of all possible genes define the phenotype for that individual.

During the evolutionary process, new offspring are produced through crossover and mutation of existing chromosomes. Crossover involves combining two parent chromosomes to create a child chromosome with similar traits but distinct genotypes. Mutation occurs when one or more bits within a chromosome are flipped randomly, resulting in slight variations in the genotype that may lead to improved fitness in later generations.

## Fitness function
To evaluate the fitness of an individual's phenotype, we need to specify a fitness function that takes into account several factors such as minimum power output, maximum cycle time, high idle load, and low operating cost. At each generation, the fittest members of the population undergo selective breeding to produce offspring that inherit certain genetic features while having unique genotypes. Only those individuals who satisfy certain criteria receive enough resources to participate in the reproduction process. Eventually, the population converges to a stable state where only a small number of highly fit individuals survive and contribute to the next generation.

## Population size, selection method, and stopping criterion
When running GP, it is important to ensure that the population size is sufficiently large so that diversity exists across the solution space. Selection methods determine which parents are selected for reproduction and how they interact. Common choices include tournament selection, roulette wheel selection, and rank selection. The convergence of the population depends on a reasonable stopping criterion. A simple approach is to terminate the algorithm after a fixed number of generations or if no improvement in fitness is observed for a specified number of iterations. Other approaches involve monitoring changes in the best performing solution and terminating early once a satisfactory level of accuracy is reached.

## Crossover operator and mutation operator
Crossover operators combine two parent chromosomes to generate children that have similar traits but different genotypes. There are many types of crossover operators, including single point, n-point, uniform, and partially matched crossover. In our work, we will use uniform crossover because it allows us to preserve both parental genotypes while introducing new genetic variation. The probability of applying crossover is typically chosen between 0.2 and 0.8 depending on the problem domain.

Mutation operators modify the genotypes of individual chromosomes by randomly changing the value of one or more bits. Common mutation strategies include bit flip, swap, scramble, insert, and inversion. In our work, we will use a bit flip mutation with a given probability p to add noise to the genetics of the population. This helps maintain diversity and prevent premature convergence to local minima caused by bad luck mutations.
