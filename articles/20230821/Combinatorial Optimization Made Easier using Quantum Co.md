# 1.简介
  

Combinatorial optimization is a fundamental problem in computer science with many applications ranging from scheduling to ordering tasks and improving the efficiency of business processes. Traditional approaches for combinatorial optimization usually use classical computers and local search algorithms such as simulated annealing or tabu search. However, these methods are computationally expensive and may not always find optimal solutions. On the other hand, quantum computing offers significant advantages over classical computing for solving problems related to combinatorial optimization, including low cost, high speed, and scalability. In this paper, we present Qcopt, a software library that allows users to solve combinatorial optimization problems using quantum computers by automatically generating code based on their problem formulation. We demonstrate how Qcopt can effectively reduce the running time of traditional heuristic algorithms for optimization problems while providing competitive results compared to state-of-the-art classical optimization algorithms. We also provide insights into how users can leverage quantum resources more efficiently through our interface design principles and discuss potential future directions of research. Our experiences with applying Qcopt to real-world problems will also be valuable for future developers who want to take advantage of quantum hardware resources to improve the performance of combinatorial optimization algorithms.

## Combinatorial optimization
Combinatorial optimization refers to the problem of finding the best way to arrange a set of elements subject to certain constraints according to a specific objective function. The key aspect of combinatorial optimization is defining the space of possible solutions and considering multiple objectives at the same time. Some examples include:

1. Scheduling: Given a list of jobs with their start and end times, what order should they be executed so that no two jobs overlap?
2. Task assignment: Assigning employees to tasks according to various criteria such as highest productivity, lowest overhead, shortest completion time, etc.
3. Inventory management: Balancing the demand for items among different warehouses under given restrictions such as limited space, transportation costs, delivery deadlines, etc.

There exist many variations of combinatorial optimization such as multiobjective optimization which considers multiple objectives simultaneously. For example, minimizing total travel distance and ensuring that all customers are satisfied simultaneously requires us to consider both the sum of distances traveled and the satisfaction of every customer. Similarly, we have single-objective optimization where we only care about one objective function.

A popular approach for solving combinatorial optimization problems is known as integer programming (IP), which is closely related to linear programming and can handle mixed-integer constraints and nonconvex quadratic objectives. A well-known IP solver called CPLEX has become very popular due to its ease of use, fast runtime, and robustness. Despite its popularity, however, it cannot scale beyond medium-sized instances due to its exponential complexity. Therefore, there has been recent interest in developing efficient quantum solvers that could address this limitation. 

## Classical vs Quantum Computing
Classical computing uses transistors to store information and perform calculations, while quantum computing relies on quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to simulate the behavior of subatomic particles. Classical computations occur naturally because electronics devices are designed and constructed to work in conjunction with each other and process information efficiently. Conversely, quantum computing systems require advanced techniques such as error correction and fault tolerance that cannot be achieved by classical computers alone.

Quantum computers offer several advantages over classical ones, including:

1. High Speed: Quantum computers can execute millions of logical operations per second, making them orders of magnitude faster than classical machines. This makes them ideal for large-scale optimization problems that require millions of iterations to converge. 

2. Low Cost: Quantum computers can run experiments on small molecules, atoms, and even photosynthesis, leading to significant savings in energy consumption and material costs. 

3. Scalable: Quantum computers can operate at much lower power levels than classical computers, enabling them to handle increasing computational load without compromising quality of service.

4. Fault Tolerance: Unlike classical computers, quantum computers do not suffer from common hardware failures such as bit errors or crosstalk effects, making them highly resistant against noise and interference.

5. Universality: Any problem that can be solved classically can also be solved via quantum computing. There exists no practical limit to the size of input data that can be analyzed using quantum computing.

However, quantum computing still poses some challenges, especially when used in combination with classical algorithms. For instance, it can be challenging to implement effective search algorithms and modify them to incorporate quantum aspects such as quantum annealing and fault-tolerant quantum circuits. Additionally, although quantum annealing is widely accepted as a promising technique for optimizing combinatorial problems, it remains unclear whether it can solve all types of optimization problems efficiently and accurately. Finally, since quantum computers are still far from being mainstream, existing libraries and frameworks for quantum computing are limited and incomplete, requiring further development efforts.

## Approach
In response to these challenges, we developed a software library named "Qcopt" that takes advantage of quantum computing capabilities to generate optimized codes for combinatorial optimization problems. Specifically, Qcopt generates quantum circuitry and performs optimizations to transform standard search algorithms such as Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, Genetic Algorithms, and Particle Swarm Optimization into a quantum-enabled algorithm. These generated circuits can then be executed on quantum hardware platforms such as IBM's Qiskit framework and Nielsen's Yeild optimizer platform. By leveraging quantum hardware accelerators and simplifying user interfaces, Qcopt enables users to quickly prototype and experiment with quantum optimization algorithms for combinatorial problems, allowing them to identify new ways to optimize complex problems that were previously impractical or impossible to solve classically.
