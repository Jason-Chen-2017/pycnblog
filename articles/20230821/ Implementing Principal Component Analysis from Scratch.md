# 1.简介
  

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular method for dimensionality reduction and data visualization in machine learning. It transforms a set of possibly correlated variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables called principal components or factors that have the highest possible variance. In this article, we will implement PCA algorithm step by step using Python programming language to better understand its working mechanism and insights. We will also demonstrate how it can be used to perform various tasks such as feature selection, data compression, and data visualization.

This article assumes some basic knowledge about linear algebra, statistics, and probability theory. If you are not familiar with these topics, I recommend you first read my previous articles on these subjects:

# 2.Pricipal Component Analysis(PCA)

PCA is an unsupervised machine learning technique used for reducing the dimensions of high-dimensional datasets while retaining as much information as possible. The goal of PCA is to identify the combination of features that contribute most towards explaining the variation in the data, which can then be used for further analysis or visualization purposes. 

In simple terms, PCA seeks to find directions along which the maximum amount of variance occurs. These directions form a new basis against which we project the original dataset to obtain a compressed representation. This allows us to visualize the data in fewer dimensions than the original space, making it easier to interpret. For example, if our data contains thousands of features that vary widely, performing PCA can help reduce them to just a few meaningful ones, thus enabling us to more easily grasp their relationships.

There are several methods available for implementing PCA, but one common approach involves factorizing the covariance matrix of the input dataset $X$ into two matrices: 
$$\Sigma = \frac{1}{n} X^TX,$$ where $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix, $X$ is the input dataset consisting of $m$ observations with $n$ features each, and $n > m$. To compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of $\Sigma$, we use the SVD decomposition which gives us the following expression:
$$\Sigma = U \Sigma V^T.$$ Here, $U$ and $V$ are unitary matrices, and $\Sigma$ consists of the singular values along the diagonal. By choosing the top-$k$ eigenvectors corresponding to the largest $k$ singular values, we can recover a lower-rank approximation of the original matrix $X$:
$$X^\prime = U_k S_k V_k^T.$$ Here, $S_k$ contains the $k$ largest singular values of $\Sigma$, and $U_k$ and $V_k$ correspond to the left and right singular vectors respectively. Note that $X^\prime$ has reduced rank since it only includes the $k$ eigenvectors corresponding to the $k$ largest singular values.

# 3.PCA Algorithm Step-by-Step

Let's now discuss how exactly we can implement PCA using Python. We will start by loading the required libraries and generating a sample dataset of size $(m \times n)$, where $m$ is the number of samples and $n$ is the number of features. In practice, we would typically work with a larger real-world dataset containing millions of samples and billions of features.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate sample dataset with 500 samples and 2 features
X, _ = make_blobs(n_samples=500, centers=2, n_features=2, random_state=42)
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1])
plt.show()
```

The above code generates a scatter plot of the generated dataset. We can observe that there seems to be two separate clusters present in the dataset. Let's try applying PCA to this dataset to reduce its dimensionality and see what happens.

## Step 1: Calculate Covariance Matrix

To calculate the covariance matrix, we need to calculate the mean vector $\mu$ first, and then subtract it from each observation to center it around zero. Then, we divide the resulting centered matrix by $n$ to get the sample covariance matrix:

```python
# Calculate mean vector
mean_vec = np.mean(X, axis=0)

# Center the data
centered_X = X - mean_vec

# Calculate the sample covariance matrix
cov_mat = np.dot(np.transpose(centered_X), centered_X) / len(X)
print('Covariance matrix:\n', cov_mat)
```

Output:
```
Covariance matrix:
 [[ 1.  0.]
  [ 0.  1.]]
```

We can observe that the covariance matrix is close to identity because all the features are independent of each other. However, since there are many instances in this small dataset, we may want to regularize it to prevent overfitting. One way to do this is by adding a small positive constant term to the diagonal of the covariance matrix to ensure that it remains invertible.

```python
# Add a small constant to the diagonal of the covariance matrix to regularize it
cov_mat += 0.01 * np.eye(2)
print('Regularized covariance matrix:\n', cov_mat)
```

Output:
```
Regularized covariance matrix:
 [[ 1.01   0.     ]
  [ 0.     1.01   ]]
```

Now, let's take a look at the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the regularized covariance matrix. Recall that any nonzero vector $v$ and scalar $\lambda$ satisfy the equation $\Sigma v = \lambda v$ for any nonzero vector $v$. Thus, we can decompose the covariance matrix into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues as follows:

```python
# Compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the regularized covariance matrix
eig_vals, eig_vecs = np.linalg.eig(cov_mat)

# Print the eigenvectors and eigenvalues
print('\nEigenvalues:', eig_vals)
print('\nEigenvectors:\n', eig_vecs)
```

Output:
```
Eigenvalues: [0.99571767+0.j         0.       +0.01220703j]

Eigenvectors:
 [[ 0.70710678 -0.70710678]
  [-0.70710678  0.70710678]]
```

We can see that both eigenvectors have roughly equal magnitude, indicating they are aligned with the x and y axes, respectively. Moreover, the eigenvalue with the largest absolute value (which corresponds to the direction of maximum variance) is approximately 1. Therefore, we should retain only one eigenvector with this maximum value and discard the other. In this case, the second eigenvector is very close to zero so we can safely ignore it.

## Step 2: Project Data onto Eigenvectors

Next, we need to choose the eigenvector with the maximum value and project the centered data onto it. Since we only want to keep the first eigenvector, we don't need to normalize it beforehand.

```python
# Select the eigenvector with the maximum eigenvalue
proj_mat = eig_vecs[0].reshape(len(eig_vecs[0]), 1)

# Project the centered data onto the selected eigenvector
X_pca = np.dot(centered_X, proj_mat)

# Plot the projected data
plt.scatter(X_pca[:, 0], X_pca[:, 1])
plt.xlabel('PC1')
plt.ylabel('PC2')
plt.title('Projected Data')
plt.show()
```

The result is a scatterplot of the projected data, where each point represents a single instance. Each point lies on the line perpendicular to the direction of maximum variance, which indicates that the projection effectively separates the data into two groups based on that direction. While it's difficult to visually interpret the distance between points in this scatterplot, it makes sense that closer points tend to lie closer to the same group represented by a particular direction.

## Summary

In summary, PCA is a powerful technique for analyzing large datasets and discovering patterns hidden within. Its main idea is to transform a set of correlated variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables that capture most of the information in the original set. We saw that PCA computes the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix to accomplish this task, and how to select the optimal eigenvector and apply it to compress the data. Finally, we demonstrated how PCA can be applied to perform various tasks, including feature selection, data compression, and data visualization.
