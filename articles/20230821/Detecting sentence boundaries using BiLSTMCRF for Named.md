Named entity recognition (NER) is an essential NLP task that aims to identify and classify named entities in unstructured text into predefined categories such as organizations, persons, locations, times and dates, etc. One common way to do NER is by identifying and segmenting the sentences within the document. However, this may not always be feasible or efficient due to various reasons, including lengthy documents, variations in style and tone, misspellings, abbreviations, and ambiguity. To address these challenges, several researchers have proposed different techniques for automatically detecting sentence boundaries without relying on rule-based approaches or dictionaries.
In this blog post, we present a new methodology for automatically detecting sentence boundaries in text data using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory-Conditional Random Field (BiLSTM-CRF) based sequence labeling models. Our model utilizes bidirectional LSTM layers to capture contextual information from both past and future words in each sentence, while employing CRF layer for modeling sequential dependencies between adjacent tokens. The resulting probabilities are then used to determine whether a token belongs to the beginning or end of a sentence. By combining multiple sequences of word vectors generated from the same input sentence, our model achieves high accuracy in sentence boundary detection. Additionally, through experimentation with different hyperparameters, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of training on large amounts of annotated data compared to small pre-trained language models like BERT. Finally, we apply our model to a range of natural language processing tasks and compare its results against state-of-the-art baselines. Overall, our work provides a promising direction for advancing the state-of-the-art in automatic sentence boundary detection methods for NLP applications.

One widely adopted technique for sentence segmentation involves splitting the text into paragraphs, but this leads to loss of context and does not consider internal structure within a paragraph, which can affect the overall quality of the resultant segments. Another commonly used technique involves building rules based on patterns of punctuation marks and typical sentence structures, but these rules often fail to catch some cases where sentences split incorrectly and require manual correction. 

State-of-the-art NLP systems typically use recurrent neural networks (RNNs), specifically long short-term memory (LSTM) cells, as feature extractors to encode raw text into vector representations that capture semantic relationships and local coherence within a sentence. Most recent advancements in NLP focus on deep learning approaches that leverage transfer learning and pre-trained models to achieve significant improvements in performance without requiring extensive labeled data or complex architecture designs. Examples include Google's BERT model and Facebook's RoBERTa, which perform well on many standard benchmarks and languages. Despite their impressive success, traditional RNN-based architectures remain the de facto choice for most NLP tasks because they offer efficient and accurate modeling of linguistic features at fine-grained levels. For instance, parsing trees or constituency graphs represent hierarchical relationships among tokens and provide a richer representation than only individual word embeddings. Nevertheless, existing approaches still fall short of achieving satisfactory results for automatic sentence boundary detection due to the lack of explicit sequential constraints that are necessary to correctly segment a sentence into subphrases. 


Recently, hybrid approaches such as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) have been shown to effectively combine global and local information during sequence labeling tasks. CRFs rely on pairwise potential functions to define constraints between adjacent labels in the sequence, which allows them to capture more complex interdependencies within a sequence. They have also demonstrated excellent performance on numerous sequence labeling tasks, particularly those involving temporal or spatial relationships. However, these models suffer from two main drawbacks: they cannot exploit the sequential nature of sentence boundary detection, making them less suitable for capturing global dependencies across all tokens; and they do not fully take advantage of multi-layered contextual information, limiting their ability to recognize more abstract or non-local relationships between tokens. To fill these gaps, we propose a novel BiLSTM-CRF based approach that combines LSTM layers to capture both global and local relationships among tokens, enabling us to capture important sentence-level features while avoiding the limitations of previous methods.
