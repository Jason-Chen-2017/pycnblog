# 2.核心概念术语说明
## 1. 预训练模型
预训练模型(Pre-trained Model)是一种深度学习模型，它是在大量的无监督训练数据上进行的深度神经网络模型的训练结果。它通常是非常大的，因为它包含了不同层的权重参数。预训练模型的好处之一是它能帮助训练更复杂的模型，而且大量的数据使得模型能够快速收敛。同时，由于预训练模型已经经过充分的训练，它的特征编码(Representation Encoding)能力已经比较强大，这使得它能够有效地解决很多自然语言理解问题。一般来说，预训练模型分为两种类型：语言模型(Language Model)和微调模型(Fine-tuned model)。语言模型用来计算一个词序列的概率分布，而微调模型则是基于已有的预训练模型，对特定任务进行微调，使其具有良好的表现。

## 2. 迁移学习
迁移学习(Transfer Learning)是机器学习中的一个重要概念。它是指借助已有的知识或技能，在新环境中学习新的知识或技能的方法。典型的迁移学习场景包括图片识别、文本理解、模型微调和模型压缩。通过利用源域的数据进行模型微调，可以有效地提升目标域的准确率。迁移学习主要有两种方式，即端到端的迁移学习和渐进式的迁移学习。端到端的迁移学习认为训练出来的模型应该直接用于目标域，但是这样做可能导致复杂的模型设计，并且难以解决数据不匹配的问题。渐进式的迁移学习则是通过初始的预训练模型进行微调，逐步地增加需要训练的层级或者参数，使得模型能够学习到目标域的数据特征。

# 3. Transfer Learning Approaches for NLP
## 1. Traditional Transfer Learning Methods
### 1. Feature Extraction
Feature extraction (FE) methods are one type of traditional transfer learning approaches that do not involve any pre-training stage. These models extract features from the data by using a feature extractor like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Once these features have been extracted they can be used to train another machine learning model on the target domain. FE methods may suffer from two main problems: 

1. Data sparsity problem: In some cases, there is limited training data available for each class label in the source domain. This means that while it is possible to use this approach for many common tasks such as sentiment analysis, image classification etc., it may not perform well when trying to solve complex natural language processing tasks such as named entity recognition.

2. Overfitting Problem: When using FE method with small amounts of labeled data, it becomes important to prevent overfitting. It is commonly done by either reducing the number of layers in the feature extractor or adding regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization to the loss function during training. However, it is still difficult to ensure that the learned features are generalizable beyond the given training data and so more advanced fine tuning strategies are often necessary.

### 2. Finetuning
Finetuning refers to updating the parameters of a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) on new task-specific data. DNNs typically consist of several hidden layers and an output layer. During finetuning, we fix all weights except those of the last fully connected layer, which is trained on our specific task of interest. We then update only this part of the network using backpropagation and gradient descent algorithm. This process involves minimizing the difference between predicted labels and true labels across multiple epochs until convergence. A major advantage of finetuning is its ability to leverage large amounts of existing labeled data for improved performance. Another benefit is that because we only tune a subset of the model's weights, it does not require extensive hyperparameter optimization or computational resources. 

However, finetuning also has limitations: 

1. Complexity: Finetuning requires knowledge of both the architecture and the details of the target task at hand. It may become challenging for tasks with high degrees of complexity such as translation or question answering.

2. Interpretability: Because finetuning directly updates the weights of the pre-trained model, it is often difficult to interpret why certain decisions were made. Moreover, since we cannot control how much information gets passed through the fixed parts of the model, the final decision may be influenced significantly by the fixed components alone.

3. Transferability: While finetuning can work well in practice, it is less effective than other transfer learning methods when dealing with highly non-linear relationships between input and output variables.

To address these issues, various approaches have been developed over the years, including multi-task learning, adversarial training, self-training, and contrastive learning. Each of these methods attempts to combine advantages of different transfer learning paradigms to obtain better results in terms of accuracy, interpretability, and transferability. 

### 3. Knowledge distillation
Knowledge distillation (KD) is a recent transfer learning technique that addresses the limitation of previous feature based and finetuned transfer learning methods. KD involves training a smaller student DNN on the soft targets generated by a larger teacher DNN, where the soft targets capture the inner working of the teacher DNN and thus help learn better representations. To achieve this, KD uses a temperature parameter that controls the degree of softness in the predictions made by the teacher DNN. By doing this, the student DNN learns to predict the soft targets instead of hard targets provided by the teacher DNN, leading to higher accuracy. 

KD has several advantages compared to the above approaches: 

1. Better accuracy: As mentioned earlier, knowledge distillation provides better accuracies by relying on soft targets instead of direct outputs of the teacher DNN.

2. Generalizability: With knowledge distillation, we can make the student DNN more generalizable without being restricted to just the target task. For example, if the target task is named entity recognition but the student DNN encounters new types of entities that it hasn't seen before, it will still be able to recognize them correctly even though it was never explicitly taught about them. 

3. Improved interpretability: Since the student DNN relies on the soft targets generated by the teacher DNN, it is easier to understand what makes the model confident in its predictions. Thus, we can analyze the behavior of the student DNN to gain insights into what features or patterns it is learning.

Despite the promising results achieved by KD, it is still under development and researchers continue to explore alternative methods to improve their performance.

### 4. Multi-task learning
Multi-task learning is a popular approach to transfer learning in NLP. Multi-task learning consists of training separate models on distinct subtasks simultaneously. One way to accomplish this is to use additional unlabeled data to train the shared layers of the network and share them among the subtasks. At test time, the models are fed inputs in sequence and combined to produce a final prediction. There are several variations of this strategy, such as jointly training models on all subtasks simultaneously or sequentially. Joint training usually outperforms sequential training due to the fact that the models can exploit complementary information obtained from the same input data. 

Another advantage of multi-task learning is that it allows us to develop stronger models that can handle more complex tasks. Many modern state-of-the-art NLP systems, such as BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, XLNet, and GPT-3, rely heavily on multi-task learning.

### 5. Adversarial training
Adversarial training is yet another approach to transfer learning in NNP. Adversarial training involves generating synthetic examples that appear similar to the original ones but are maliciously designed to fool the classifier. Specifically, we add noise to the original examples and minimize the cross-entropy error between the noisy examples and the clean, original ones. This encourages the network to adapt to the distribution shift introduced by the adversaries, resulting in improved robustness against attacks. Despite the effectiveness of adversarial training, however, it is generally slower than other approaches and requires more careful hyperparameter tuning.

### 6. Self-training
Self-training is a recently proposed transfer learning method that combines iterative improvement of a base model with automatic selection of unlabelled data for training. Essentially, we start by training a simple model on a small amount of labeled data and gradually expand the size of the dataset by repeatedly selecting batches of unlabeled data and refining the base model using the selected data. The goal of self-training is to create an accurate and reliable model that is capable of handling real-world scenarios and unexpected situations that might arise during deployment.

Self-training has three key benefits:

1. Accuracy: Self-training improves the overall accuracy of the model as it learns to handle the most challenging aspects of the task.

2. Flexibility: By continually integrating new data points, self-training enables the model to automatically adjust to changes in the underlying distribution, making it useful for applications that require continuous monitoring and evaluation.

3. Scalability: Self-training can scale easily to very large datasets by parallelizing the batch selection and refinement steps, allowing for faster improvements in speed and accuracy.

### 7. Contrastive learning
Contrastive learning is another type of transfer learning method specifically designed for NLP tasks. Instead of attempting to reconstruct the original text, contrastive learning aims to identify meaningful semantic differences between pairs of sentences. Consequently, the objective of contrastive learning is to learn embeddings that maximize the similarity between sentence pairs that are syntactically and semantically related. One implementation of contrastive learning is SimCSE, which uses a masked language modeling (MLM) objective to learn good sentence representations that preserve the contextual meaning of individual tokens.

One potential downside of contrastive learning is that it may fail to generalize well to novel domains or tasks. However, this issue is mitigated by leveraging transfer learning paradigms such as multi-task learning and fine-tuning, along with carefully designing the MLM objective and balancing the tradeoff between intra-domain diversity and inter-domain consistency.

Overall, transfer learning techniques offer many benefits in terms of flexibility, efficiency, and generalizability, making them an essential tool for building accurate natural language understanding systems.

## 2. Pre-trained Models for NLP
In recent years, significant progress has been made in NLP through the use of pre-trained models. Pre-trained models are powerful tools that enable developers to quickly build and deploy NLP solutions without requiring expensive manual labeling or annotated data sets. They come in two main varieties: 

1. Language models (LM): These models aim to estimate the probability of the next word in a sentence given the current words. Some of the most popular LMs include GPT-2, GPT-3, and BERT. These models are built on transformer architectures that take advantage of attention mechanisms and are trained on large corpora of text. Overall, language models provide excellent baseline accuracy on various natural language processing tasks.

2. Encoders: Encoder-based models represent text as vectors that capture semantic relationships between words. Common encoders include BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, and Electra, all of which are based on transformer architectures. The primary advantage of encoder-based models is their ability to capture long-range dependencies within sentences. Additionally, they are tailored towards solving specific NLP tasks and can be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks.

In addition to providing basic NLP functionality, pre-trained models can help reduce the need for extensive experimentation and iteration during development cycles. It is crucial for organizations to invest in developing and maintaining pre-trained models that can help them meet the growing demand for AI-powered NLP solutions.
