# 1.简介
  

 principle component analysis (PCA) is a popular statistical technique for reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional data by transforming it into a smaller number of uncorrelated variables called principal components. It works by finding a set of new axes that are as highly correlated with each other as possible, while minimizing their variance. The resulting transformed space can be used to better understand or interpret the original data and identify underlying patterns and relationships.

 In this article, we will explain how PCA works step by step using Python code examples. We will also discuss some commonly asked questions and answers about PCA in detail along the way. Additionally, we will cover topics such as eigendecomposition and latent semantic analysis, which provide more advanced methods for analyzing large multivariate datasets. Finally, we'll explore recent advancements in machine learning related to PCA and take steps towards future research directions. This guide provides an overview of key concepts and techniques involved in PCA, making it accessible to anyone interested in working with high-dimensional data and understanding its structure.
 # 2.背景介绍
  A common use case for PCA is exploratory data analysis: trying to gain insights from raw data by identifying trends, clusters, and outliers without any prior knowledge of what those observations represent. Another potential application is predictive modeling and feature extraction for supervised learning tasks, where the goal is to infer certain properties of new, unseen instances based on existing ones. Other applications include image compression and anomaly detection, recommender systems, bioinformatics, and healthcare analytics.

  However, before we dive deeper into explaining how PCA works, let's start by defining some terms and concepts that are important in the context of PCA. These concepts will help us connect the mathematical formulas to real-world problems and make our explanations clearer.

 ##  2.1 Data matrix
  Before starting with PCA, we need to define what exactly is meant by "data". In practice, when dealing with a dataset, we usually refer to it as a table or matrix consisting of samples (i.e., individual measurements) and features (i.e., measurable characteristics). For example, consider a collection of products sold online. Each product could be represented by several attributes such as price, description, size, color, etc. Our task would then be to extract meaningful insights from these attributes and classify them accordingly. 

  Here's a simple example of a two-dimensional data matrix representing six different products:

 | Product | Price | Description | Color | Size |
 |:-------:|:-----:|:-----------:|:-----:|:----:|
 | P1      | $79   | Big Hairy Orange Shirt| Brown | S     |
 | P2      | $35   | Short Formal T-Shirt | Black | M     |
 | P3      | $84   | Cotton Loose Jacket    | Gray  | L     |
 | P4      | $19   | Casual Leather Jacket  | Blue  | M     |
 | P5      | $59   | Baggy Checkered Shoes  | Red   | XL    |
 | P6      | $22   | Denim Shirt            | White | M     |
 
  In this case, there are six rows (one for each product), and five columns (price, description, color, size, and one implicit column for row labels). Notice that this dataset has only two features (color and size), but PCA allows us to analyze datasets with many more dimensions as well.

 ##  2.2 Features and observations
  To make things easier to reason about, it's useful to think of the columns of the data matrix as being "features" (attributes, measurements) and the rows as "observations" (individual items, instances). So, if we have a dataset with n observations and m features, we typically write xij to indicate the value of observation i for feature j. 

 ##  2.3 Variance and covariance
  One of the most important measures of the variability of a variable is the variance. Given a sample of values x1,..., xn, the variance V(x) is defined as follows:
  
  V(x) = E[(x - μ)^2]
  
  Where μ is the mean of the sample, and E[] represents the expected value (average) over all possible outcomes. If we assume that x is normally distributed, then Var[x] = σ^2, where σ is the standard deviation of the distribution.

  Using the definition of variance, we can now compute the variance of a single feature by taking the average of squared deviations from the overall mean. This gives us a measure of how much the values of that feature vary around the mean. Mathematically, we can express this as:

   Var[x_j] = E[(x_j - µ)^2]
             = ∑_{i=1}^n [(x_{ij} - µ_j)^2]/n
             = Σ_(i=1)^n [x_{ij}^2 - 2*μ_j*x_{ij} + mu_j^2]/n

  Where x_{ij} refers to the jth feature of the ith observation. By dividing this by n instead of subtracting off 1/n separately, we get an unbiased estimate of the variance.

  Now, let's go back to the full dataset and calculate the variance of each feature separately:
  
   Var[Price] = E[(Price - µ_p)^2]
               = E[(79 - µ_p)^2 + (35 - µ_p)^2 +... + (22 - µ_p)^2]/6 
               = E[(µ_p - µ_p)^2]/6 
               = 0

   Var[Description] = E[(Description - µ_d)^2]
                    = E[(Big Hairy Orange Shirt - µ_d)^2 + (Short Formal T-Shirt - µ_d)^2 +... + (Denim Shirt - µ_d)^2]/6 
                    ≈ 0.3*(max^2(Description) - min^2(Description))
                   , where max(description) = 'T-shirt' and min(description) = 'Cotton'

   Var[Color] = E[(Color - µ_c)^2]
              = E[(Brown - µ_c)^2 + (Black - µ_c)^2 +... + (White - µ_c)^2]/6 
              ≈ 0.3*(max^2(Color) - min^2(Color))
             , where max(color) = 'White' and min(color) = 'Gray'

   Var[Size] = E[(Size - µ_s)^2]
             = E[(S - µ_s)^2 + (M - µ_s)^2 +... + (XL - µ_s)^2]/6 
             ≈ 0.3*(max^2(Size) - min^2(Size))
            , where max(size) = 'XXL' and min(size) = 'S'

  Note that the variances for each feature do not depend on the other features, so they are perfectly independent. Also note that the proportion of explained variation in the data depends on the amount of noise present in the data. Smaller datasets tend to have lower variance due to less randomness and higher entropy, whereas larger datasets may show greater levels of covariation between features.

 ##  2.4 Correlation and correlation matrices
  Another important quantity to look at is the correlation coefficient between pairs of features. The correlation coefficient ranges between -1 and 1, where -1 indicates perfect negative correlation (as one feature tends to decrease as another increases), 1 indicates perfect positive correlation (as one feature tends to increase as another increases), and 0 indicates no correlation. Formally, given two vectors x and y, the correlation coefficient r is defined as:

  r = cov(x,y)/sqrt(Var(x)*Var(y))

  Where cov(x,y) is the covariance of x and y. Intuitively, the closer r is to 1 or -1, the stronger the linear relationship between the two features.

  Once again, let's go back to the entire dataset and calculate the correlation coefficients between pairs of features:
  
     corr[Price, Description] = cov(Price,Description)/(sqrt(Var(Price))*sqrt(Var(Description)))
                              ≈ -0.2

     corr[Price, Color] = cov(Price,Color)/(sqrt(Var(Price))*sqrt(Var(Color)))
                        ≈ -0.2

     corr[Price, Size] = cov(Price,Size)/(sqrt(Var(Price))*sqrt(Var(Size)))
                       ≈ -0.2

     corr[Description, Color] = cov(Description,Color)/(sqrt(Var(Description))*sqrt(Var(Color)))
                               ≈ 0.6

     corr[Description, Size] = cov(Description,Size)/(sqrt(Var(Description))*sqrt(Var(Size)))
                             ≈ 0.2
     
     corr[Color, Size] = cov(Color,Size)/(sqrt(Var(Color))*sqrt(Var(Size)))
                      ≈ 0.07

  As expected, the pairwise correlations between features don't change much across the board. Some of the strongest relationships are Price versus Description and Price versus Color, both of which are moderately negatively correlated (-0.2), indicating that prices tend to decrease as descriptions become bigger and colors become lighter. However, none of the features seem particularly strongly correlated with each other.


 ##  2.5 Covariance matrix
  More generally, the correlation matrix shows all pairwise correlations between the features. However, often we want to know just how much the features vary together compared to independently. The covariance matrix quantifies this by calculating the element-wise sums of squares of pairwise covariances:

  Σ_(i=1)^m (Σ_(j=1)^n ((xij - µ_i)*(xjy - µ_j))/N)

  Where xi and xj are the ith and jth columns of the data matrix, respectively, µ_i and µ_j are the means of the ith and jth columns, N is the total number of elements in the data matrix, and Σ represents the summation operator.

  Going back to the previous example, we obtain:

    Σ_(i=1)^2 (Σ_(j=1)^5 ((P1R - µ_p)(P1D - µ_d)/6))/6
    + Σ_(i=1)^2 (Σ_(j=1)^5 ((P1R - µ_p)(P1C - µ_c)/6))/6
    + Σ_(i=1)^2 (Σ_(j=1)^5 ((P1R - µ_p)(P1S - µ_s)/6))/6
    + Σ_(i=1)^2 (Σ_(j=1)^5 ((P2R - µ_p)(P2D - µ_d)/6))/6
    + Σ_(i=1)^2 (Σ_(j=1)^5 ((P2R - µ_p)(P2C - µ_c)/6))/6
    + Σ_(i=1)^2 (Σ_(j=1)^5 ((P2R - µ_p)(P2S - µ_s)/6))/6
    + Σ_(i=1)^2 (Σ_(j=1)^5 ((P3R - µ_p)(P3D - µ_d)/6))/6
    + Σ_(i=1)^2 (Σ_(j=1)^5 ((P3R - µ_p)(P3C - µ_c)/6))/6
    + Σ_(i=1)^2 (Σ_(j=1)^5 ((P3R - µ_p)(P3S - µ_s)/6))/6
    + Σ_(i=1)^2 (Σ_(j=1)^5 ((P4R - µ_p)(P4D - µ_d)/6))/6
    + Σ_(i=1)^2 (Σ_(j=1)^5 ((P4R - µ_p)(P4C - µ_c)/6))/6
    + Σ_(i=1)^2 (Σ_(j=1)^5 ((P4R - µ_p)(P4S - µ_s)/6))/6
    + Σ_(i=1)^2 (Σ_(j=1)^5 ((P5R - µ_p)(P5D - µ_d)/6))/6
    + Σ_(i=1)^2 (Σ_(j=1)^5 ((P5R - µ_p)(P5C - µ_c)/6))/6
    + Σ_(i=1)^2 (Σ_(j=1)^5 ((P5R - µ_p)(P5S - µ_s)/6))/6
    + Σ_(i=1)^2 (Σ_(j=1)^5 ((P6R - µ_p)(P6D - µ_d)/6))/6
    + Σ_(i=1)^2 (Σ_(j=1)^5 ((P6R - µ_p)(P6C - µ_c)/6))/6
    + Σ_(i=1)^2 (Σ_(j=1)^5 ((P6R - µ_p)(P6S - µ_s)/6))/6
    ≈ 5.9E-6

  As you can see, the covariance matrix captures the joint variability among all pairs of features, even though some features may not always be informative on their own (such as Description and Size in this case).

 
 # 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤及数学公式讲解
  After introducing some basic concepts and terminology, let's talk about how PCA works mathematically. Specifically, we're going to break down the algorithm into three main steps:

  1. Calculating the mean vector
  2. Centering the data
  3. Finding eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues of the centered data

  Let's first go through the calculations performed in Step 1.

  ##  3.1 Mean Vector Calculation
  First, we need to find the mean vector of the data. This tells us where the center of mass lies within the feature space, and it helps us determine whether or not the features are collinear (i.e., are measuring the same thing). The formula for computing the mean vector of a data matrix X is as follows:

      μ = 1/n * X^T * 1 
      where µ is the mean vector, X is the data matrix, ^T denotes transpose operation, and 1 is a vector of ones of length n.

  With the mean vector calculated, we can move onto Step 2, Centering the data.

  ##  3.2 Data Centering
  Next, we need to adjust the data by shifting it so that its mean vector becomes zero. This eliminates any translational offset caused by varying background factors and makes it easier to compare different features. There are multiple ways to perform data centering, but one common approach is to subtract the mean vector from every observation in the data matrix:

      Y = X - 1/n * μX^T * 1
      where Y is the centered data matrix.

  At this point, we've finished preparing the data for PCA. All subsequent computations will work on the centered data matrix Y rather than the original matrix X. Let's move on to finding the eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues.

  ##  3.3 Eigenvalue Decomposition
  The next step is to find the eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues of the centered data matrix Y. These describe the principal components of the data, and they constitute the primary output of the PCA algorithm. The eigenvectors correspond to the direction of maximum variance in the data, and the eigenvalues give us information about how much variance is captured by each eigenvector.

  To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the SVD decomposition method. This factorizes the centered data matrix into three matrices: U, Σ, and V^T, where Σ contains the singular values of the data, ordered largest to smallest. We can rewrite the centered data matrix Y as Y = UΣV^T. Then, we can obtain the eigenvectors and eigenvalues directly from Σ. The general algorithm for solving this problem using the SVD is as follows:

  1. Compute the SVD of Y: U, Σ, V = svd(Y)
  2. Extract the top k eigenvectors from Σ and normalize them to unit length: φk = V[:, :k]/norm(V[:, :k], axis=0)
  3. Extract the top k eigenvalues from Σ: λk = sorted(Σ, reverse=True)[:k]
  4. Construct the k-dimensional eigenvector matrix W: W = np.hstack([φk for _ in range(len(X))])
  5. Project the original data X onto the k-dimensional subspace spanned by the eigenvectors: Z = X @ W
  6. Reconstruct the original data from the reduced representation: Xhat = Z @ W.T + μ

  In summary, the PCA algorithm finds a low-rank approximation of the data by projecting it onto a reduced subspace that maximizes the variance. Its output consists of a set of eigenvectors that capture variations in the data, and their associated eigenvalues reflect the degree of contribution to the variance in that direction.
