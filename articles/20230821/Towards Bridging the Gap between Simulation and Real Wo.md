In this paper we introduce an approach to bridge the gap between simulation and real world in robotic control by using both learning-based methods and physical simulation approaches. The key idea is to use a learned model that captures not only low-level behaviors of the robot but also high-level human intentions or goals. This enables us to enable the robot to adapt to different environments while maintaining its ability to interact with humans. We achieve this through two main components: predictive state representations and goal-driven exploration policies. In our experiments on a simulated Fetch robot, we show that our method can successfully capture non-trivial dynamics such as smooth and dynamic trajectories and allow the robot to learn complex behavioral skills despite limited training data. Finally, we demonstrate how the same method can be extended to perform effective navigation tasks in real-world scenarios where obstacles, uncertain terrain, and distractions are commonplace. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential of bridging the gap between simulation and reality to develop intelligent robots capable of performing challenging tasks. We hope that our proposed framework will inspire other researchers to explore new ways to leverage simulation and real-world data to build more robust and reliable robotic systems.

Robotic control typically relies on several complementary techniques, including closed-loop simulations, optimization-based controllers, reinforcement learning algorithms, and machine learning methods. Although these techniques have been widely used in the past decade, there has been relatively little progress towards combining them into a single system that can effectively leverage simulation and real-world data. On one hand, it remains difficult to simulate complex dynamic systems accurately and efficiently, which makes it difficult to train models that mimic their behavior in the real world. On the other hand, current simulators do not incorporate any feedback from the environment or user input during execution, which means they cannot correctly respond to changes in the environment over time. Furthermore, even if simulation was possible, designing policy optimization strategies that combine expert knowledge and learned models would require careful consideration of tradeoffs between accuracy, efficiency, and generalization capacity.

To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid approach based on goal-directed exploration in the simulator and learning-based state representation in the real world. Specifically, we first collect large amounts of real-world demonstrations that capture both task-specific skills and human preferences. Using these demonstrations, we construct a deep neural network (DNN) that maps raw sensor inputs to high-level control actions that approximate the desired trajectory. Next, we transfer this learned model to a physical system running a simulation engine. During simulation, the DNN generates target states and commands for the physical system to execute. In the real world, when the physical system encounters a novel situation or receives new information, it updates its internal model and retrains itself using the collected demonstrations. By doing so, we create a unified model that combines expert knowledge and learned heuristics and adapts dynamically to new situations and user feedback. Additionally, we integrate learning into the simulation pipeline by utilizing demonstration replay as well as imitation learning. By collecting multiple demonstrations at various levels of complexity, we train our model to recognize diverse behaviors and generate appropriate responses, enabling it to adapt to a wide range of contexts without relying solely on simulation. Finally, we experimentally validate our approach on a simplified version of the Fetch robot, comparing it to existing baselines and human demonstrators, showing significant performance improvements due to our enhanced modeling capability.

Our contribution combines three areas of robotics - computer vision, reinforcement learning, and artificial intelligence - to solve the problem of integrating simulation and reality in order to build more intelligent and reliable robotic systems. Together, these techniques aim to address the following challenges:

1. Integrating simulation and reality: Our proposed framework involves transferring a learned model from a virtual environment to a physical system, allowing the latter to take advantage of improved hardware capabilities and the former's accumulated experience. However, our method requires considerable computational resources and may still struggle under resource constraints or long runtimes. Therefore, further development is needed to optimize our approach and parallelize inference across multiple processors.

2. Human-in-the loop learning: In many practical applications, it is crucial to include human guidance in the decision process. While previous research focused on developing autonomous agents that could infer user intentions directly from visual observations, recent advances in neural language models provide promising tools for enabling intelligent conversation with users via text or speech. However, most of these models rely either on curated datasets or weak supervision, limiting their effectiveness in unseen domains. Moreover, it is important to ensure that the agent's behavior does not conflict with the user's, especially when collaborating with humans. Thus, future directions should focus on developing methods that leverage natural language understanding to better understand the context and user intentions, and generating prompts or instructions for communication to avoid conflicts. 

3. Generalization: Despite extensive exploration of the potential of machine learning and deep learning techniques for robotic control, few efforts have focused on bridging the gap between simulation and reality. Moreover, in some cases, the learned model may not generalize well to completely new scenarios or conditions. Future work should investigate whether there exist generalization issues associated with traditional state space partitioning schemes, and consider alternative architectures and training strategies to improve generalization performance.
