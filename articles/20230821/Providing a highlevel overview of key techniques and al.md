# 2. Concepts and terms
## 2.1 Supervised learning
Supervised learning (SL) is a type of machine learning in which an algorithm learns from labeled data and predicts the output for new input data. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping function between input variables and output variables by training on a set of examples where each example has been manually labeled with the correct answer or outcome. 

The basic process involves four steps:

1. **Data collection**: Collecting labeled data consisting of pairs of inputs and outputs that are used to train the model. Examples include image classification problems such as recognizing different animals or handwriting characters, text classification problems such as spam filtering, or stock price prediction problems.
2. **Data preparation**: Preparing the collected data by cleaning it and transforming it into a suitable format so that it can be fed into the algorithm. This step typically involves converting categorical values into numerical ones, normalizing the scale of features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. 
3. **Algorithm selection**: Choosing an appropriate algorithm based on the problem at hand and the available resources. Popular choices include decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, support vector machines, and neural networks. Some of these algorithms have hyperparameters that need to be tuned to achieve optimal performance.
4. **Model training**: Feeding the prepared data into the selected algorithm and adjusting its parameters until it produces accurate predictions on the test set. During this stage, the algorithm may also receive feedback from human experts to fine-tune its performance over time.

In summary, supervised learning involves building a model using a labeled dataset, which consists of input-output pairs. It involves the following main tasks:

1. Data Collection: collecting and preprocessing datasets.
2. Algorithm Selection: selecting an appropriate algorithm based on the requirements of the task.
3. Model Training: fitting the chosen algorithm to the data to produce accurate models.
4. Evaluation and Fine Tuning: evaluating the accuracy of the model and fine-tuning the model if necessary.

## 2.2 Unsupervised learning
Unsupervised learning (UL) is another type of machine learning in which an algorithm tries to discover patterns and relationships within unlabeled data without any prior knowledge about the system being modeled. UL approaches often involve clustering or dimensionality reduction techniques like principal component analysis (PCA), kernel PCA, and t-SNE. These methods attempt to find underlying structures or groupings in the data without reference to any prescribed labels. 

The basic process involves two steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Collecting raw data, which might be unstructured or noisy, but usually does not contain any predefined labels. One common use case for unsupervised learning is anomaly detection, identifying abnormal events or outliers in large data sets. Another example would be market segmentation, grouping customers based on their purchase behavior or demographics.
2. **Data Analysis/Preprocessing:** Analyze the data using various techniques, including feature extraction, normalization, and visualization. Use dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or t-SNE to reduce the number of dimensions in the data while retaining relevant information. Clustering algorithms like K-means can then be applied to identify groups or clusters of similar data points.

In summary, unsupervised learning involves finding hidden structure or pattern within unlabelled data without any prescribed labels. It involves the following main tasks:

1. Data Collection: gathering and processing data.
2. Data Analysis/Preprocessing: analyzing and preprocessing data to extract meaningful insights.
3. Clustering Algorithms: applying clustering algorithms to group similar data points together.

## 2.3 Reinforcement learning
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning approach that enables agents to learn from experience instead of just from static instructions. In RL, an agent interacts with an environment through actions and receives feedback in form of rewards and penalties. It must learn how to select actions that will maximize long-term reward, and must explore the environment to avoid getting stuck in local optima. RL approaches can be categorized into deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and actor-critic methodologies. DRL explores more complex environments using advanced optimization techniques like Deep Q-Networks (DQN). Actor-critic methodologies combine policy gradient methods with value function approximators. Policy gradients update the probability distribution of actions given current observations, whereas critic functions estimate the expected return for each state.

The basic process involves three steps:

1. **Environment Setup:** Set up the simulation environment and create an interface for the agent to communicate with it. Define the states, actions, and rewards for the agent to act within the environment.
2. **Agent Configuration:** Choose an appropriate agent architecture and define its policies, value functions, and exploration strategies. Train the agent using samples generated by interacting with the environment.
3. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the agent's performance and make improvements based on the results. Repeat steps 1-3 until satisfactory performance is achieved.

In summary, reinforcement learning involves an agent interacting with an environment and receiving immediate feedback in the form of rewards and penalties. Its objective is to learn how to behave intelligently in order to maximize future rewards. It involves the following main tasks:

1. Environment Setup: setting up the simulated environment and defining the state space, action space, and reward function.
2. Agent Configuration: choosing an appropriate agent architecture and defining its policies, value functions, and exploration strategies.
3. Evaluation: evaluating the agent's performance and making improvements based on the results.
