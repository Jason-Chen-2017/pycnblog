# 1.简介
  

Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is an emerging field in machine learning that aims to develop explainable and interpretable machine learning systems that can be used by human decision-makers for better understanding of their outcomes. XAI has multiple applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, security, and transportation, where aiding humans in making trustworthy decisions is essential. This article will provide an overview of the state of the art in XAI and highlight some key research directions. We will also discuss how interactive examples could support users in gaining insights from complex AI models through visualizations and explanations.

## 2.1 Basic Concepts and Terminology
### 2.1.1 What is XAI?
Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is an emerging area of machine learning research focused on developing techniques to create human-interpretable models that are able to provide insights into their behavior. The goal is to allow humans to understand what drives model predictions and make data-driven decisions more confidently. Common uses include improving patient care, reducing risk in financial institutions, identifying fraudulent activities, and guiding automated vehicles. 

### 2.1.2 Types of XAI Techniques 
There are several types of XAI techniques:

1. Model Inferences
2. Model Interpretability 
3. Data Visualization
4. Active Learning 

#### 2.1.2.1 Model Inference
Model inference refers to using the trained model to make predictions on new unseen data instances or test sets. One common technique for explaining model inferences is LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations). LIME generates local surrogate models at each prediction point based on perturbing feature values around the input instance. These surrogate models are then used to generate local explanations for the prediction. Other methods include SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), GradCAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), and Anchor explanations. 

#### 2.1.2.2 Model Interpretability
Model interpretability is a type of explanation that allows us to understand why a given model makes certain decisions. It involves studying features and their relationships with the target variable and the underlying reasoning mechanisms behind them. Two popular approaches to model interpretability are Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots. 

#### 2.1.2.3 Data Visualizations
Data visualization tools can help reveal patterns and trends within large datasets. They can be particularly useful for exploratory analysis when we want to identify outliers, biases, or clusters. Several popular data visualization techniques include histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps. 

#### 2.1.2.4 Active Learning
Active learning is a type of machine learning approach that involves choosing a set of labeled training data points that maximizes our confidence in the learned model's performance on yet-unlabeled data points. The main idea is to iteratively query the user about which data points they believe should have high probability of being correctly labeled so that these additional samples can be added to the training dataset. Popular active learning algorithms include uncertainty sampling, margin sampling, and Bayesian optimization. 


### 2.1.3 Terms and Definitions
**Adversarial Examples**: Adversarial examples are inputs designed to intentionally mislead a machine learning system, often resulting in incorrect classification or other adverse effects. Researchers have been hard at work creating adversarial examples that attack different parts of deep neural networks and natural language processing models.

**Attention Mechanism**: An attention mechanism enables a machine learning algorithm to focus on specific regions of an input during model inference. Attention mechanisms can be implemented via recurrent layers in sequence models like LSTM or transformer networks, convolutional layers in image recognition models, and pooling layers in CNNs.

**Counterfactual Reasoning**: Counterfactual reasoning is a branch of cognitive science that studies how people think and behave under alternative circumstances. Counterfactual thinking involves looking ahead to imagining scenarios that would not have occurred if certain assumptions had not been made. It helps to improve decision-making processes in contexts where there are uncertainties.

**Domain Generalization**: Domain generalization refers to the ability of a machine learning model to perform well on related but different domains. A common application of domain generalization is cross-domain sentiment analysis, which focuses on analyzing social media comments across various topics such as politics, sports, and entertainment.

**Fairness**: Fairness is a quality that ensures equal opportunities for all members of society to achieve desired outcomes. There are several fairness definitions including demographic parity, disparate treatment, and group fairness.

**Graph Neural Networks**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are graph-based machine learning models that process information from graphs rather than traditional tabular data. GNNs use message passing and aggregation functions to learn representations of nodes and edges in the graph.

**Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning System**: Human-in-the-loop machine learning systems involve incorporating human expertise into the training pipeline. This typically involves building a feedback loop between the AI system and human experts to correct errors and improve its accuracy.

**Instance-Level Fairness**: Instance-level fairness measures whether the protected attributes (e.g., race, gender, etc.) of individual instances within a dataset are equally represented across groups or classes.

**Interpretability**: Interpretability is a measure of how easily a machine learning model can be understood and used by others. Interpretability techniques may range from simple rules-of-thumb to highly complex algorithms that require specialized knowledge.

**Kernel Method**: Kernel method is a mathematical technique for constructing non-linear classifiers and regression models from linear ones by applying nonlinear mappings to the original space. The kernel trick is widely used in pattern recognition, statistics, and machine learning.

**Label Noise**: Label noise refers to noisy labels assigned to data points that do not accurately reflect the true class label. Label noise can occur due to subjectivity or contextual factors, e.g., user-generated content on online platforms or traffic signs on roadways.

**Overfitting**: Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, leading to poor generalization performance on new data. Overfitting can be prevented through regularization techniques like dropout and early stopping.

**Positive-Unlabeled Learning**: Positive-unlabeled learning (PU Learning) is a semi-supervised learning technique that involves partitioning the dataset into two subsets - positives (labeled examples) and negatives (unlabeled examples without ground truth labels). The aim is to train a classifier while minimizing the impact of negative examples on the model's accuracy.
