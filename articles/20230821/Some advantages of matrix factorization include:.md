# 1.简介
  

Matrix Factorization (MF) is a well-known collaborative filtering algorithm that has been used to predict user preferences from the data collected from their interaction with items or services. MF can be applied to different types of datasets including sparse ones like social network connections and text documents. It allows for more accurate recommendations by reducing the dimensions of high dimensional feature vectors while preserving the relevant information in those vectors. In this article, we will discuss some benefits and potential applications of MF.


# 2.Concepts & Terms
## Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative filtering refers to algorithms that make predictions about the interests of users by collecting data on their past behaviors and preferences and using it to recommend items that they may be interested in. The basic idea behind collaborative filtering is that people who have similar preferences also tend to have similar tastes.

In general, there are two types of collaborative filtering techniques - explicit feedback systems and implicit feedback systems. Explicit feedback systems use ratings given by users to determine which items they prefer. Implicit feedback systems do not require users to explicitly provide ratings but rely on other signals such as actions taken during interactions between them and the system. 

To improve performance, several approaches have been proposed such as latent factor models, content-based filtering, neighborhood methods, and probabilistic matrix factorization. Matrix Factorization (MF) is one of these approach where collaborative filtering problems are solved using low rank approximation of user-item interactions matrix. MF model decomposes the user-item interactions matrix into product of two matrices called user factors and item factors. User factors represent user preferences over latent features whereas item factors capture item characteristics. These factors are estimated based on known user-item interactions and new data points can then be predicted by multiplying the corresponding user and item factors.


## Latent Factors Model
The goal of latent factor models is to approximate the original matrix through low rank decomposition. This technique has proven effective in recommendation systems because the original ratings matrix is usually too large to handle computationally. By finding a low rank approximation of the ratings matrix, only few parameters need to be estimated. Thus, the learned latent factors can easily explain most of the variance in the original ratings matrix. 


### Types of LFM Models
There are three popular types of latent factor models:
* Regularized Matrix Factorization (RMF): This type of model applies regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. It uses the same loss function as traditional linear regression models, i.e., minimizing error between predicted values and actual values along with penalties for large coefficients. RMF model provides better accuracy than SVD-based method for low rank approximations.
* Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF): NMF optimizes the objective function by making sure that all elements in the matrix are non-negative. It achieves good results when the matrix contains negative entries due to errors in capturing positive correlations among features.
* Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF): PMF combines ideas from both RMF and NMF models. Instead of trying to find exact solutions, it uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the distribution of possible factors and compute the probability of each element being present in any of the k latent factors. This approach handles sparsity in the input data by allowing missing values and producing robust predictions even when some factors become zero.

### Learning Algorithms
Learning algorithms for latent factor models vary depending on whether the problem is convex or nonconvex. When the learning task is convex, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms can be used directly. However, SGD requires tuning the hyperparameters such as step size, momentum term, etc. To solve nonconvex optimization problems, various quasi-Newton methods such as Conjugate Gradient (CG), Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS), and Limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS) can be used. Despite its popularity, CG is still preferred over others for faster convergence rate and improved numerical stability compared to other methods.

### Regularization Techniques
Regularization techniques are used to avoid overfitting in latent factor models. Two commonly used techniques are L1 and L2 regularization. The former encourages sparsity in the solution space by shrinking small weights towards zero. The latter encourages smoothness in the solution space by adding penalty terms associated with large weight magnitudes. Other techniques such as dropout and batch normalization are also useful for improving generalization performance. 


## Content-Based Filtering
Content-based filtering is another popular recommendation technique where similarities between items are measured based on their attributes. For instance, if two movies share common genres, actors, directors, and keywords, they might be recommended together. Similarly, books that are related to each other could be recommended together.

In contrast to collaborative filtering, content-based filtering relies solely on the attributes of the items rather than previous user behavior. Therefore, content-based filtering does not depend on individual preferences but instead focuses on global patterns. As a result, content-based filtering produces less personalized recommendations since it cannot take into account individual preference differences across individuals. Nevertheless, content-based filtering remains a powerful tool for recommending novel items that users may not have previously considered.

Two main steps involved in implementing content-based filtering are vector representation and similarity measurement. Vector representation involves transforming raw attributes of items into numeric representations suitable for computing distances. Similarity measurements involve calculating how closely related two items are based on their respective attribute vectors. Common distance metrics used in content-based filtering include Euclidean distance, Cosine similarity, and Jaccard coefficient.

A major limitation of content-based filtering is scalability. As the number of items increases, the time required to calculate pairwise similarities becomes increasingly slow. One way to address this issue is by applying dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA reduces the dimensionality of the attribute vectors so that they are easier to manage and compare. Another option is to use database indexing techniques to quickly locate relevant items based on query criteria.
