# 1.简介
  

## （1）定义
Parallel distributed processing (PDP) is a computing model that allows multiple processors or nodes in a network to work simultaneously on the same task by splitting it into smaller subtasks that can be processed concurrently by different processors. PDP has many uses, including improving computational efficiency and increasing system scalability, reducing communication overhead, enhancing fault tolerance, and allowing parallel computation across multiple platforms with heterogeneous hardware resources. In this article, we will focus on using Apache Hadoop and MapReduce for implementing PDP. 

## （2）介绍
Apache Hadoop is an open-source framework that enables storing and processing large datasets on clusters of commodity servers. It offers high data availability through replication and automatic failover capabilities, making it suitable for applications that require fast, reliable access to large datasets. Hadoop provides several interfaces such as Java API, command line interface, RESTful web services, and graphical user interface (GUI). The name "Hadoop" refers to three components - HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator), and MapReduce (a programming model for processing large datasets). 

MapReduce is a software framework designed for parallel processing of big data sets on large clusters of computers. It splits a job into map tasks which process the input data and generate intermediate key-value pairs, and reduce tasks that merge these pairs into output results. The main goal of MapReduce is to distribute the processing load amongst the available compute resources and ensure fault-tolerance. However, MapReduce also provides more advanced features like partitioning, sorting, and joining data sets, which are not covered in this article.

In this article, we will introduce basic concepts related to PDP and then explain how MapReduce implements PDP for efficient parallelization of computations across clustered systems. We will start by defining some important terms used throughout the article and move towards an overview of Hadoop architecture and its components. Finally, we will demonstrate how MapReduce's programming model can be used for parallel computing of mathematical functions over massive datasets. 

# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before proceeding further, let us define some commonly used terms:

1. Cluster: A group of servers connected together that share storage, memory, and processing power. Clusters help improve performance and reliability because they allow dividing up the workload between different machines while still providing complete service even if one machine fails. 

2. Master node: One server in the cluster responsible for managing all other nodes in the cluster. It runs the Hadoop daemons such as NameNode, DataNode, ResourceManager, NodeManager, etc., manages the cluster via a master daemon called Zookeeper, and coordinates resource allocation.

3. Slave node: All other servers in the cluster except the master node. They run the actual tasks requested by the client application and perform various operations on data such as reading/writing files from/to disk, executing programs, etc.

4. Job Tracker: A master daemon responsible for scheduling jobs, tracking their status, and monitoring them during execution. It sends out heartbeats to the slaves to check their health, tracks resource usage by each slave, and allocates resources based on priority, fairness, and job requirements.

5. Task Tracker: A slave daemon responsible for running individual map or reduce tasks assigned by the Job Tracker. It communicates with the Task Scheduler and executes tasks assigned by it.

6. Input file(s): Data that needs to be processed by MapReduce program. Each input file typically resides on a single node and may be split into smaller chunks.

7. Output directory: Directory where MapReduce writes the final result. This directory typically resides on a single node but may contain multiple files due to shuffling during aggregation.

8. Split: A portion of an input file that is sent to a mapper or reducer function in batches for processing. Splits are created by the DataNode when loading the input file.

9. Mapper function: Function that processes input data and generates intermediate key-value pairs. The number of mappers depends on the size of the input data.

10. Reducer function: Function that aggregates the intermediate values generated by the mappers and combines them into final output. There can be at most one reducer per job.

Now that we have defined the common terms, let us go ahead and dive deeper into Hadoop Architecture and Components.


# 3. Hadoop Architecture and Components
## 3.1 Hadoop Architecture Overview
The following diagram shows the overall architecture of Hadoop:


As shown in the above figure, Hadoop consists of four main components:

1. **HDFS**: Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) stores and retrieves large datasets. It distributes data across multiple nodes in the cluster and replicates data for redundancy and availability purposes. It has two primary components:
     * NameNode: Manages metadata about files stored on the Hadoop filesystem and performs block placement.
     * DataNodes: Stores the actual data blocks.
2. **MapReduce**: MapReduce is a programming framework for processing large datasets in parallel across a cluster. It uses the concept of maps and reduces to divide the dataset into small portions, apply transformations to those portions, and aggregate the results. It has three primary components:
     * JobTracker: Schedules and monitors the jobs executed on the cluster.
     * TaskTracker: Runs the individual map or reduce tasks assigned by the JobTracker.
     * TaskScheduler: Assigns the map or reduce tasks to TaskTrackers for execution.
3. **YARN**: Yet another resource negotiator (YARN) is a platform for running Hadoop applications. It provides a distributed environment for executing applications and managing resources. Its core component is the ResourceManager which assigns resources and schedules the containers on the NodeManagers. It has three major components:
    * ResourceManager: Responsible for handling resources on the cluster and assigning them to Containers.
    * NodeManager: Responible for launching and managing containers on the cluster nodes.
    * ApplicationMaster: Interface between users and the YARN infrastructure. It receives resource requests from the Client and sends scheduling instructions to the ResourceManager. Once the resources are allocated to the containers, the ApplicationMaster starts running the application code inside them. 
4. **ZooKeeper**: ZooKeeper is a centralized service that maintains configuration information and coordinate the activity of multiple distributed applications. It is used by the Hadoop components to synchronize configurations, coordinate node failures, manage elections, and provide synchronization primitives.

## 3.2 Hadoop Components Details
Let us now explore each of the Hadoop components in detail.

### 3.2.1 NameNode
NameNode manages metadata about files stored on the Hadoop filesystem. When a new file is written, the NameNode determines the set of datanodes that should store copies of the data. It keeps track of file permissions, timestamps, and locations. Every change made to the namespace (such as renaming or deleting a file or directory) is recorded in the transaction log and can be rolled back if needed. The NameNode exposes a simple file system interface to clients and handles most of the complexities involved in scaling to handle petabytes of data. 

### 3.2.2 DataNode
DataNode is responsible for storing and retrieving the actual data blocks. It accepts write requests from the client, reads and writes data to disks, and responds to read requests from other datanodes in the cluster. Datanodes communicate regularly with the NameNode to report their current state and update the shared file system namespace. The DataNode caches frequently accessed data locally for faster response times.

### 3.2.3 JobTracker
JobTracker is responsible for coordinating the execution of jobs submitted to the cluster. It receives the request for a new job from the client, submits tasks to the TaskTrackers, assigns containers to the tasks, and monitors the progress of the tasks until completion. The JobTracker keeps track of the location of all map tasks and reduce tasks, as well as any intermediate data generated by the tasks. If a TaskTracker fails or becomes unresponsive, the JobTracker reassigns any remaining tasks to healthy TaskTracker instances. The JobTracker supports priority levels and ensures that critical tasks are executed first.

### 3.2.4 TaskTracker
TaskTracker is a worker daemon that runs on every node in the cluster and runs the individual map or reduce tasks assigned to it by the JobTracker. Each TaskTracker communicates with the JobTracker and reports its available resources, failure counts, and progress updates to the JobTracker. As part of its role, a TaskTracker also acts as a resource manager, responsible for allocating CPU time and memory resources to map and reduce tasks. TaskTracker detects failed tasks and restarts them automatically.

### 3.2.5 Yarn
YARN stands for yet another resource negotiator, which was introduced earlier. It offers a distributed environment for executing applications and managing resources. It provides a higher degree of abstraction than the underlying Hadoop components, simplifying the deployment of applications on a cluster. YARN offers a unified interface that supports batch processing, interactive querying, stream processing, and graph analytics. The ResourceManager controls the resources available to the cluster, schedules the execution of applications, and monitors their progress. The NodeManager runs the individual containers assigned to it, sharing the available resources equally among all containers within a node. The ApplicationMaster connects users to the YARN infrastructure and initiates the execution of the application logic inside the containers.

### 3.2.6 ZooKeeper
ZooKeeper is a centralized service that maintains configuration information and coordinates the activity of multiple distributed applications. It is used by the Hadoop components to synchronize configurations, coordinate node failures, manage elections, and provide synchronization primitives. It provides strong consistency guarantees for transactions and can operate in highly-available mode with no single point of failure. ZooKeeper exposes a hierarchical namespace that organizes nodes as a tree structure, and each node contains data and optional child nodes. Clients interact with the ZooKeeper ensemble using a simple protocol, enabling them to create, delete, and manipulate data in the distributed system. The ensemble uses a leader election algorithm to elect a unique leader, ensuring that there is only one active session at any given time. ZooKeeper also includes an administrative console that helps troubleshoot issues and maintain the system's integrity.

# 4. Using MapReduce for PDP 
In this section, we will showcase how MapReduce can efficiently implement PDP using the Word Count Example. Before moving forward, make sure you have gone through the previous sections thoroughly and understand the basics of Hadoop and PDP. Also, familiarize yourself with the basic terminology mentioned before e.g., Job Tracker, Task Tracker, NameNode, DataNode, YARN, etc.. 

## 4.1 Running WordCount Example using MapReduce
We will use the famous example of counting the occurrence of words in a document to illustrate the working of MapReduce. Let’s assume we have a text document containing the following sentences:

```
Hello world!
This is a test sentence for word count example.
```

To count the frequency of occurrences of each word in the document, we need to follow the below steps:

1. Read the input file consisting of the text document.
2. Tokenize the text document to extract individual words.
3. For each word, emit a key value pair <word, 1> pair to the mapper.
4. Group the emitted keys by the same word and sum the values to get the total count of occurrences of each word.
5. Write the aggregated results to the output directory.

The implementation of this workflow using MapReduce would look something like the following pseudocode:

```python
// Initialize empty dictionary to hold the frequencies
freq = {}

// Iterate over the input lines and tokenize each line
for line in input_lines:
  tokens = line.split()
  
  // Emit a key-value pair for each token 
  for token in tokens:
    context.write(token, "1")
    
    // Update the frequency count for the token
    freq[token] += 1
    
// Aggregate the frequency counts by adding up all the values for the same key
for key, value in freq.items():
  context.write(key, str(value))  
```

In this implementation, we iterate over the input lines and tokenize each line to extract individual words. We then emit a key-value pair for each token to the mapper, along with a string representation of integer value equal to 1. Since we want to count the number of occurrences of each word, we simply increment the corresponding counter in our `freq` dictionary after writing the key-value pair to the mapper. After iterating over all the input lines, we loop through the `freq` dictionary and emit a key-value pair for each key-value pair in the dictionary, along with the integer value as the frequency count. These aggregated results are then written to the output directory.  

Using this approach, we can scale the analysis of larger text corpora by breaking down the analysis into smaller pieces that can be analyzed independently by separate nodes in the cluster, thus achieving better utilization of available resources. Additionally, since the processing happens on a per-word basis, errors caused by misspelled words or infrequent words do not significantly affect the accuracy of the analysis. Thus, MapReduce can be considered a robust and efficient tool for performing parallel distributed processing on large datasets.
