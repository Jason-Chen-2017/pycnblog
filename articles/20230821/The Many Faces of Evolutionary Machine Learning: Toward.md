近年来，人工智能（AI）在各个领域都取得了巨大的成功。而进化式机器学习（Evolutionary Machine Learning, EML）是一个新兴的研究方向，其理论基础也正在逐渐成熟。该领域的最新研究也使得机器学习的研究和应用更加透明、可复制和可重复。然而，目前国内外关于Evolutionary Machine Learning的理论和实践仍不够系统完整。本文试图通过一个完整的框架介绍Evolutionary Machine Learning的理论、研究及应用，并给出一些参考和评价。
# 2. Background Introduction 
In the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been rapidly applied in various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, etc. With the emergence of evolutionary machine learning (EML), a new research direction is emerging. This field has made significant progress in understanding how to design novel algorithms that can adaptively optimize their behavior based on previous knowledge. In this article, we will introduce a comprehensive theory of EML and its applications along with some evaluation methods for verifying the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithmic solutions. To begin with, let's define some terms used in EML before going deeper into the details.
# 2.1 Basic Terms and Concepts

## Population 
Population refers to an individual or group of individuals which are being optimized by a particular optimization method or algorithm. 

## Parent Selection 
Parent selection is the process of selecting the most suitable parents from the population according to certain criteria, such as fitness value or crowding distance.

## Crossover 
Crossover is the act of mating two parent chromosomes to generate offspring. It occurs during reproduction of the genetic material.

## Mutation 
Mutation is the process of introducing random changes to the genetic sequence of an organism at a specific position within the sequence. 

## Fitness Function 
Fitness function assigns a numerical value or score to each chromosome in a population, depending on how well it performs in achieving the objective function specified for the problem under consideration.

## Genotype 
Genotype is the actual sequence of nucleotides (DNA or RNA) present in an individual or an element of the population. 

## Phenotype 
Phenotype is the visible or perceivable physical appearance of an individual or an element of the population. It consists of all the genetic information required to reproduce an individual and provide the desired response.

## Algorithmic Process 
An algorithmic process involves using mathematical formulas or procedures to solve problems efficiently and effectively. These processes include sorting, searching, pattern matching, compression, encryption, and image processing.

## Classification Problem 
A classification problem is one where there is a need to predict discrete labels/categories for given input data. For example, spam filtering, sentiment analysis, disease diagnosis, and object detection are some popular examples of classification problems.

## Regression Problem 
Regression problem involves predicting continuous output values instead of class labels. Common examples of regression problems are price prediction, stock market predictions, and sales forecasting.

## Feature Engineering 
Feature engineering is the process of selecting relevant features from raw data collected from sensors, images, text documents, etc., that contribute towards the goal of solving a classification or regression problem. It helps improve the performance of machine learning models by reducing noise, eliminating redundant or irrelevant variables, and transforming the feature space into a more effective representation for training.

## Hyperparameters 
Hyperparameters are parameters that are set prior to running the optimization algorithm itself. They control the properties of the algorithm such as mutation rate, crossover probability, number of generations, etc.

## Meta-heuristics 
Meta-heuristics refer to a category of optimization techniques developed using advanced computational methods. Meta-heuristics are widely used in search, scheduling, and optimization problems to find optimal solutions. Some commonly used meta-heuristics include genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, and ant colony optimization.

# 2.2 The Model-Based Evolutionary Machine Learning Paradigm

Model-based evolutionary machine learning (MB-EML) paradigm is a type of EML that uses machine learning algorithms trained on historical data to guide the search for better solutions. MB-EML combines machine learning with the principles of evolutionary computation. By following a modular approach, MB-EML splits the optimization problem into several subtasks, each solved independently using different machine learning algorithms. Each module interacts with other modules through shared data representations, allowing them to exchange information effectively. The architecture of MB-EML allows the exploration of multiple possible solution paths simultaneously.


The core components of MB-EML include:

1. Representation Module - responsible for encoding the problem domain and generating candidate solutions represented as vectors of real numbers.
2. Objective Function Module - takes the vectorized candidate solutions generated by the representation module and maps them to a numeric scalar representing their fitness quality.
3. Optimization Strategy Module - determines the search strategy employed to navigate the parameter space defined by the hyperparameters of the optimization algorithm.
4. Neural Network Module - trains neural networks using historical data to learn patterns and relationships between input data and output data.
5. Data Module - stores and preprocesses historical data for use by the representation, objective function, and neural network modules.
6. Interaction Module - handles communication between different modules.


Using these core components, MB-EML can tackle complex optimization problems such as optimizing the layout of a circuit for signal propagation. However, MB-EML requires sophisticated hardware infrastructure to run efficiently, making it challenging to apply it to large-scale problems.

# 2.3 Comprehensive Overview of Evolutionary Machine Learning Approaches

Evolutionary Machine Learning approaches typically fall into three categories:

1. Classical Evolutionary Algorithms – These algorithms have a deductive character and rely on mathematical optimization techniques to find good solutions. Examples of classical algorithms include genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and stochastic hill climbing.

2. Artificial Intelligence Methods – These algorithms have a rule-based character and rely heavily on heuristics and reasoning. Examples of AI methods include decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks.

3. Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithms – These algorithms combine the strengths of both traditional optimization methods and modern AI methods. They leverage both established techniques and advances in AI to overcome the limitations of traditional optimization methods while also exploring unexplored regions of the solution space. Examples of hybrid algorithms include Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and evolving deep neural networks (EDNN).
