Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) is a type of neural network that helps to learn long term dependencies in time series data and makes it possible for the model to predict future values based on previous inputs. It has been demonstrated that RNN can be used for forecasting purposes by analyzing historical data with short periods of time between consecutive observations. In this article, we will discuss how LSTM works specifically for time series prediction using Python and TensorFlow library. We will also implement an example program using LSTM model in TensorFlow library to demonstrate its working principles and accuracy. This article assumes readers have some basic understanding of deep learning concepts such as neural networks, activation functions, backpropagation, etc. If you are new to these topics or interested in expanding your knowledge about them, I recommend reading through <NAME>'s "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" book. 

In summary, we will use an LSTM model to analyze the historical weather data collected from different cities across the world. The goal of our analysis is to identify patterns and trends that may indicate a change in temperature within several days ahead of time. Once we have identified the relevant patterns and trends, we will generate predictions for future temperatures based on those patterns and trends using the trained LSTM model. Finally, we will compare the predicted results with actual values to evaluate the accuracy of our forecasting model. To achieve high accuracy levels, we need to train the LSTM model over a sufficiently large dataset and fine-tune its parameters to optimize its performance. However, despite these challenges, LSTM models provide promising results for time series forecasting tasks and constitute a valuable tool for many real-world applications.


# 2.基本概念术语说明
## A.Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):
The recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural networks where information is passed from one time step to another. As the name suggests, the input data is processed sequentially at each time step to keep track of past events. The hidden layers of the RNN receive both sequential and temporal data inputs and process them accordingly. Each layer processes the input data according to specific weight matrices that act as connections between neurons.

## B.Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): 
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of RNN architecture that offers better memory management compared to traditional RNN architectures like GRU or Elman Net. In LSTM, instead of just outputting the current state after processing the input data, the cell state passes on the memory of the previous time step, which is retained throughout the entire sequence. Additionally, LSTM includes gating mechanisms that control the flow of information into or out of the cell state. These gates allow the LSTM to choose what to forget and what to remember during training. By doing so, LSTM enables better long-term memory retention and improves overall model performance. 

## C.Backpropagation:
Backpropagation refers to the method used to update the weights of a neural network based on the error calculated during forward propagation. Backpropagation updates the weights in reverse order of the computational graph formed during forward propagation. Gradients are calculated for each weight in the network and updated iteratively until convergence.

## D.Time Series Data:
Time series data refers to a collection of discrete measurements made over time. Examples of time series data include daily stock prices, wind speed, sales figures, etc. A common characteristic of time series data is that it exhibits seasonality, meaning that certain parts of the data follow similar patterns over time.

## E.Training Dataset:
A training dataset is a set of data used to train the neural network. During training, the algorithm adjusts the weights of the network to minimize the loss function generated by comparing the predicted outputs with actual outputs.

## F.Testing Dataset:
A testing dataset is a separate set of data used to measure the accuracy of the trained neural network's ability to generalize to unseen data. After training the network, we test its accuracy on the testing dataset and report the percentage of correct predictions.

## G.Hyperparameters:
Hyperparameters are adjustable parameters that affect the behavior of the neural network but are not learned by the algorithm itself. They usually require manual tuning before training the network. Common hyperparameters for time series forecasting include input/output size, batch size, number of epochs, learning rate, and regularization parameter.
