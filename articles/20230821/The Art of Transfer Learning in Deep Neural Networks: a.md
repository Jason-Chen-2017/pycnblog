# 1.简介
  

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance on numerous tasks such as image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing. However, they require large amounts of training data to achieve high accuracy. To address this issue, transfer learning has emerged as an effective technique for adapting pre-trained models to new domains with limited or no labeled data. In recent years, many works have been proposed to apply transfer learning to DNNs, including fine-tuning, feature distillation, domain adaptation, and self-training. This article reviews these techniques and analyzes their advantages, limitations, and potential applications in deep neural network (DNN) transfer learning. We hope that this survey can provide valuable insights into the research progress towards achieving better generalization capability in DNNs by exploiting unlabeled data.
# 2.基本概念术语说明

Transfer learning refers to transferring knowledge learned from one task to another related but different task. It is widely used in computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and other fields where there are limited or no labeled training data available. The goal is to leverage the knowledge gained during one task and use it to improve performance on a similar yet more challenging task without any additional labeled data. 

In DNN transfer learning, we train a model on a source dataset (e.g., ImageNet) using a small amount of labeled data, which is typically called the "pre-training" stage. During the pre-training stage, the weights of all layers are fixed except for the last few layers, which will be trained further on the target dataset. After the pre-training stage completes, the final layers of the model are frozen and only the output layer is allowed to be modified, resulting in a fully initialized model. Then, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned using the target dataset, i.e., the model weights are updated so that they are tailored to the target dataset specifically. There are several ways to perform finetuning, including full finetuning, partial finetuning, gradual finetuning, and contractive learning. Finally, we also explore some advanced variants of transfer learning, such as feature distillation, semantic shift adaptation, and domain adaptation.

Fine-tuning, commonly referred to as weight updates, consists of updating only the output layer parameters of the model while keeping the remaining weights of the entire model constant. Partial finetuning refers to finetuning only part of the output layer at each iteration, leaving other parts unchanged. Gradual finetuning involves starting with smaller learning rates over time and increasing them slowly, which helps prevent catastrophic forgetting when finetuning on multiple datasets. Contractive learning focuses on reducing the degree of interference between the target and source features by using regularizers such as ridge regression or Lasso. Feature distillation uses a lightweight student model to learn features from the pre-trained teacher model instead of directly predicting the labels. Semantic shift adaptation uses a special loss function to guide the distribution shift from the source to target domain during training. Domain adaptation involves applying specialized algorithms designed for dealing with domain shifts, such as co-training, virtual adversarial training, or cost-sensitive learning. Self-training involves automatically generating synthetic labeled data by randomly selecting pairs of inputs from different domains and assigning the same label based on the teacher's prediction. All these techniques aim to enhance the performance of the transferred model by leveraging information from both the source and target domains.

## Fine-tuning

After initializing the weights of the last few layers of the pre-trained model, fine-tuning entails adjusting those weights so that they fit well to the target dataset. Typically, the process includes the following steps:

1. Initialize the input and output dimensions of the new last layer.
2. Randomly initialize the weights of the new last layer.
3. Use a small learning rate to update the weights of the new last layer and keep the weights of the rest of the model constant. Repeat step 3 until convergence.

More formally, let $X$ be the set of all possible input samples and $Y$ be the corresponding set of output labels, denoted by $(x_i, y_i)$ for $i=1,\cdots,m$. Let $\mathcal{D}_S = \{(x^i_j,y^i_j)\}_{j=1}^n_{i=1}$ be the source dataset consisting of $n$ labeled examples of size $m$, where $x^i_j\in X$ and $y^i_j\in Y$, and $\mathcal{D}_T=\{(x^{i'}_j,y^{i'}_j)\}_{j=1}^{n'}\subseteq \mathcal{D}_S$ be the target dataset consisting of $n'$ labeled examples. Define $M_{\theta}(X;\lambda)=\arg\min_{\theta} L(y^{(i)}, f_\theta(x^{(i)}))+\frac{\lambda}{2}\|\theta\|_2^2$, where $L(\cdot,\cdot)$ is a loss function, $f_\theta(x)$ represents the DNN model with parameter $\theta$, and $\lambda$ is the tradeoff parameter between training error and regularization term. Note that the number of hidden units in the last layer must match the dimensionality of the output label space ($\dim(Y)$). With respect to $X\cap X',$ the transfer learning problem reduces to finding $M_{\theta}(X\cap X';\lambda),$ since the shared weights $\theta$ represent a good approximation to minimize the cross-entropy between predicted probabilities on both datasets.

Here are the specific details about how to implement fine-tuning:

1. Initialize the parameters $\theta$ of the new last layer randomly. 
2. Compute the gradient of the loss function $L(\cdot,\cdot)$ with respect to the parameters $\theta$ using backpropagation.
3. Update the parameters $\theta$ according to the formula $\theta:= \theta - \eta\nabla_\theta M_{\theta}(X\cap X';\lambda)$ where $\eta$ is the learning rate.

We note that fine-tuning only affects the parameters of the new last layer. Any layers before the last layer remain unchanged, although they may need tuning if fine-tuning was not done carefully. One potential drawback of fine-tuning is that it does not take advantage of all the labeled data present in the source dataset. A better approach would be to first fine-tune the pre-trained model on a small subset of the source dataset (such as a validation set) to find a good initialization point for the new last layer. Then, optimize the whole model using the entire source dataset to ensure maximum utilization of the available labeled data.

## Partial Finetuning

Partial finetuning means updating only part of the output layer parameters at each iteration, while keeping the other parts of the model constant. The most common method for performing partial finetuning is to freeze the weights of all layers up to the desired depth in the pre-trained model and allow the weights of the next layer (the new last layer) to be updated. Here are the specific details:

1. For each example $x\in X$, compute the logits $z$ generated by the previous layer of the pre-trained model:
   $$
   z=\sigma(W^\ell x + b^\ell)
   $$
   where $W^\ell$ and $b^\ell$ are the weights and biases of the layer $\ell$.
   
2. Set the softmax output layer parameters $\theta=(w,b)^T$ and freeze the weights of the rest of the model: 
   $$
   \theta_l:= \begin{cases} \theta_l & l<L \\ w^T z+b^T & l=L \end{cases}, \forall l \geq 0
   $$
   where $L$ is the desired depth of the new last layer.
   
3. Compute the gradients of the loss function $L(\cdot,\cdot)$ with respect to the output layer parameters $\theta_L$. Specifically, consider the binary case where $K=2,$ i.e., $Y=\{-1,+1\}$. Then, define the sigmoid activation function $\sigma(x)=\frac{1}{1+exp(-x)}$ and the cross-entropy loss function $L(y,p)= -y log p -(1-y)log(1-p)$. The derivative of the cross-entropy loss with respect to the predicted probability can be computed as follows:
   $$
   \frac{\partial L}{\partial p}= p-y
   $$
   
4. Update the output layer parameters $\theta_L$ using stochastic gradient descent with a learning rate $\eta$:
   $$
   \theta_L := \theta_L-\eta\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta_L}
   $$
   where $\eta$ is the learning rate.
   
5. Freeze all the weights of the model except for the newly added output layer, and continue training the rest of the model normally. 
   
Note that partial finetuning assumes that the optimal solution lies within a restricted subspace of the space of models. If the pre-trained model has too much capacity, then it might become impossible to find a suitable solution within the given constraints. Furthermore, even though the pre-trained model provides useful initial points for the new output layer, it may still struggle to converge to the optimal solution due to its overly complex architecture. Consequently, careful hyperparameter tuning and regularization techniques are needed to obtain good results.

## Gradual Finetuning

Gradual finetuning involves gradually increasing the learning rate of the last layer and decreasing it over time. This strategy aims to prevent catastrophic forgetting by allowing the model to recover from mistakes made in earlier epochs. Here are the specific details:

1. Start with a small learning rate $\eta_0$ and increase it slowly over time:
   $$\eta_t=\frac{k_1}{1+\sqrt{t}}$$
   where $k_1>0$ is a hyperparameter that controls the speed of learning rate increase.
   
2. Train the model using mini-batches of size $B$ using SGD with momentum:
   $$
   \theta_t := \theta_{t-1} - \eta_t v_{t-1} - \alpha_t (\theta_{t-1}-\theta^*)
   $$
   where $v_{t-1}$ is the velocity vector calculated from the previous batch, $\alpha_t=\frac{1}{t}$ is the dampening factor, and $\theta^*$ is the pre-defined reference point (e.g., the centroid of the source dataset or zero-initialization).
   
3. Decrease the learning rate exponentially using the formula $\eta_t'=\frac{k_2}{t^\beta}$, where $k_2<k_1$ and $\beta<1$ are hyperparameters that control the shape of the learning rate decay. 
   
The main difference between gradual finetuning and standard SGD is that the learning rate is adjusted dynamically rather than being fixed throughout training. This leads to faster convergence and improved generalization compared to standard SGD. However, since it relies on choosing a suitable learning rate schedule, it requires careful tuning of the hyperparameters.

## Contrastive Loss Training

Contrastive loss training is another way to perform transfer learning using deep neural networks. Unlike traditional methods like fine-tuning, partial finetuning, and gradual finetuning, contrastive loss training explicitly encourages the representation of semantically similar samples to have similar representations. More precisely, the objective function encourages the network to produce embeddings that are closer together for positive pairs of samples and farther apart for negative pairs of samples. The key idea behind contrastive loss training is to introduce a distance metric between two vectors representing an input sample and attempt to maximize the similarity between them. Since the metric measures the dissimilarity between the vectors, it can potentially capture important visual features that are difficult to capture using convolutional or fully connected layers. 

To construct the embedding matrix $E$ for each class in the target dataset, we follow the following procedure: 

1. Extract features $f_i$ of each sample $x_i\in X$ using the pre-trained CNN network $f_{\theta_i}$.

2. Construct a similarity matrix $S\in\mathbb R^{N\times N}$ where $N$ is the total number of samples in the target dataset, where entry $(i, j)$ corresponds to the similarity between the features $f_i$ and $f_j$:
   $$
   S[i][j] = cosine\_similarity(f_i, f_j)
   $$
   Alternatively, the diagonal entries of the matrix correspond to intra-class similarities, and the off-diagonal entries correspond to inter-class distances.
   
3. Normalize the rows of the similarity matrix to have unit length, so that each row sums to 1.

4. Solve the optimization problem:
   $$
   E = argmax_{\vec e_k} \frac{1}{2} \|X W - \vec e_k \|_F^2 + \lambda k \|E\|_F^2
   $$
   where $X$ is the matrix of extracted features, $W$ is the weight matrix obtained after training the model on the source dataset, $\vec e_k$ is the $k$-th row of the embedding matrix, and $\lambda$ and $k$ are hyperparameters controlling the strength and sparsity of the penalty terms respectively.

Once the embedding matrix is constructed, the projection matrix $P$ can be obtained by computing:
$$
P = E V^{-1/2}
$$
where $V$ is the eigenvector matrix of the similarity matrix. Each column of $P$ corresponds to a representative vector for the corresponding class in the target dataset. By projecting the source dataset onto the $k$-dimensional space defined by the $k$-th principal component of the similarity matrix, we can align the classes effectively without relying on annotations or manual design of intermediate layers. Note that this algorithm assumes that the similarity matrix contains enough information to separate the target classes effectively, and fails otherwise.
