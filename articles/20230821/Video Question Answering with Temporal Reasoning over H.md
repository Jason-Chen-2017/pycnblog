Video question answering (VQA) is a challenging natural language processing task that requires a system to understand and reason about videos in order to retrieve relevant information related to the user's query. With growing popularity of social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram etc., video content generation has also increased significantly, leading to an increasing demand for VQA systems that can handle diverse sources of data. This work aims at solving this problem by presenting a novel approach called temporal VQA which integrates multiple sources of video data such as speech-visual, textual, and audio into a unified framework. We propose a neural network based architecture that incorporates temporal reasoning techniques using attention mechanisms between different types of inputs such as visual frames, captions, audio segments and their corresponding timestamps. The proposed model is evaluated on both public benchmarks and real world datasets. The results show significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art approaches. Further, our analysis suggests how the proposed architecture enables us to effectively combine heterogeneous data modalities for better understanding of the video context.
In this blog post we will focus mainly on the first part of our paper, i.e., introducing the basic concepts of human motion understanding, action recognition, and facial expression recognition from videos. Then we will go through the details of the proposed temporal VQA approach followed by its evaluation on benchmark and real-world datasets. Finally, we will discuss some open research challenges and possible future directions of this field.

Let’s start with the basics.

Human Motion Understanding
Human motion understanding refers to the ability of machines to recognize and manipulate movement patterns of humans. In recent years, there have been several advancements in machine learning methods for human motion understanding, including computer vision algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). One common theme across these methods is that they are trained on large amount of labeled training data, usually consisting of thousands or even millions of video sequences. Despite these advances, however, few works have attempted to integrate multiple types of data, such as speech, text, and audio signals, to enable a more comprehensive understanding of human behavior. Recently, the advent of big data technologies and advanced computing resources has made it feasible to gather massive amounts of unstructured data in various formats from various sources such as social media, online news, weather reports, and surveillance footage. These new data sources can provide valuable insights into people’s behaviors and preferences, making them essential components of robust and effective VQA systems.

Action Recognition
Action recognition refers to the process of identifying specific actions performed by individuals within a video clip. While traditional approaches rely solely on still images, recent advancements in CNN-based action recognition models have shown promise when combined with multimodal data such as videos and/or sensor data. Specifically, two popular methods for combining visual and semantic features include spatial transformer networks (STN) and convolutional long short-term memory networks (ConvLSTM). STNs use spatial transformations to map input videos onto a fixed reference frame, allowing action recognition modules to capture fine-grained interactions between objects and background scenes. ConvLSTMs exploit sequential dependencies among pixels within each frame to learn complex spatial relationships, enabling action recognition modules to identify temporal changes and repetitive motions. Moreover, state-of-the-art action recognition models such as I3D and TSN have achieved high accuracy by jointly leveraging both visual and temporal features.

Facial Expression Recognition
Facial expression recognition involves recognizing the emotions conveyed by individual faces within a video sequence. Despite decades of research effort, previous methods for facial expression recognition were mostly designed for static image inputs rather than videos. However, nowadays, the rate of change of human expressions is becoming faster than ever, making it crucial for machines to adapt to new environments and perform tasks quickly. To address this challenge, recent advancements in deep learning methods for facial expression recognition include convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Both CNN and RNN-based architectures have demonstrated promising performance in classifying facial movements. GANs offer another alternative approach to improving the expressiveness of facial recognition models, where a generator learns to generate synthetic face images while a discriminator identifies authentic images and rejects fake ones. Overall, there exists a need for research that combines different types of data and multi-modal deep learning approaches to enhance facial expression recognition capabilities for video-based applications.
