 Spring framework is one of the most popular Java frameworks and has become the de-facto standard for building enterprise applications in the past few years. The core principles behind the Spring framework are Dependency Injection(DI), Inversion of Control(IoC) and Separation of Concerns(SoC). This article will provide a detailed explanation of these principles alongside with examples related to each principle which will help developers understand how they can use the Spring framework effectively for developing their own projects.

         ### What is Spring?
         Spring framework is an open source Java development framework that provides various tools and libraries that simplify the development process and make it easier to write clean, maintainable and testable code. It also supports several programming paradigms such as Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) or Functional Programming(FP). It provides many modules such as MVC, Data Access/Integration, Messaging, Web, Security etc., making it even more powerful than any other Java web application framework.

         ### How does it work?
         To begin with, let's take a look at some basic concepts and terminology involved in the Spring framework. 

          #### Core Concepts
          1. **Spring Container**: A container is a runtime environment used by Spring to manage beans. Beans are objects created through configuration metadata provided by external resource files such as XML, properties file, annotations, etc. The container creates instances of beans on demand, injecting dependencies into them as required.

          2. **Beans**: Beans are managed by the spring container and represent logical units of functionality that have business logic and state. They encapsulate data and behavior together so that we don't need to create separate classes to implement this functionality. Bean creation happens when you start up your Spring container. Beans can be configured declaratively using xml or annotations or programmatically using Spring’s APIs.


          We can define three main scopes of beans - singleton, prototype, and request-scoped. Singleton scope means that only one instance of a bean gets created per Spring container, Prototype scope indicates that every time an object of a bean needs to be instantiated, a new instance is created. Request-scoped beans exist within the lifecycle of an HTTP request, allowing us to share information between multiple objects across different requests.

          There are two types of beans - FactoryBean and @Autowired annotation. 
            
          *FactoryBean*: It is a special type of bean that produces other beans rather than just representing simple values or POJOs. These beans typically wrap some existing technology or service and provide access to it through its methods. For example, JDBC template is a factorybean that wraps database connection pooling and provides a set of methods to perform CRUD operations against a relational database. 
           
```java
  // creating JdbcTemplate bean 
  public class DataSourceConfig {
      @Bean 
      public JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate() throws SQLException { 
          return new JdbcTemplate(dataSource());
      }
      
      @Bean 
      public DataSource dataSource() throws SQLException {
          BasicDataSource ds = new BasicDataSource();
          ds.setDriverClassName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
          ds.setUrl("jdbc:mysql://localhost/testdb");
          ds.setUsername("root");
          ds.setPassword("password");
          return ds;
      }
  }
  
  // accessing data fromJdbc Template   
  @Service
  public class UserService {
     private final JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;
     
     @Autowired
     public UserService(JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate) {
         this.jdbcTemplate = jdbcTemplate;
     }

     public List<User> findAllUsers() {
         String sql = "SELECT id, name FROM users"; 
         return jdbcTemplate.query(sql, rowMapper); 
     }
    
     private RowMapper<User> rowMapper = (rs, rowNum) -> new User(rs.getLong("id"), rs.getString("name"));
  }
```  
          *@Autowired Annotation*: One of the key features of the Spring Framework is dependency injection. Autowired annotation allows us to automatically wire beans based on the specified type without having to explicitly specify the names of the dependencies. It searches for matching beans in the same Spring context and injects them if found. If no matching bean is found, it raises an exception.

```java
    // configuring autowired annotation in the constructor 
    @Component
    public class MyService {

        @Autowired
        private MyRepository myRepository;
        
        public void doSomething() {
            System.out.println(myRepository.findAll()); 
        }
    
    }

    // defining Repository interface    
    public interface MyRepository extends JpaRepository<MyEntity, Long>{

    }
```  

          #### Other Important Terminology
          1. **Configuration Metadata**: Configuration metadata refers to data provided in external resource files like XML, Properties file, Annotations etc. By annotating our beans using these meta data files, we tell Spring what exactly should be injected into our beans and where those resources should be loaded from.

          2. **Spring Context**: Spring context is the heart of the Spring framework. It manages all the components of a Spring application including beans, connections pools, transactions, application events, etc. It loads and configures all the necessary resources during startup.
