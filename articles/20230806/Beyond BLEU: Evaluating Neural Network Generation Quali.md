1979年，肯·纳弗拉斯·布莱恩在《自然语言处理》期刊上发表了一篇名为“BLEU”的论文，被称作“互联网百科全书”中的经典之一，此后流传开来成为当代信息检索的重要评估标准。
         
         2018年底，DeepMind提出了一种基于深度学习的文本生成模型GPT-2，并成功地应用于对话系统、文本摘要、机器翻译等领域。这一突破性的结果引起了广泛关注，而国际顶尖的研究者们也纷纷投入到评测文本生成模型质量的新时代。
         
         在过去十年中，针对文本生成任务的多个指标已经被提出，例如ROUGE、METEOR、BERTscore、SMOGIndex等，它们都试图评价生成文本与参考文本之间的相似度。然而，当前方法仍然存在着诸多局限性，尤其是在指标之间产生冲突时，如何平衡不同方面的需求也是个难题。本文将介绍一种新的多指标方法——COMET，它可以同时评估模型的生成效果与可读性（即客观程度）、情感色彩、多样性、流畅性以及说服力等多个方面，从而为文本生成模型的训练和改进提供更全面的依据。

         

         # 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
         ## 2.1 Metirc
         ### 2.1.1 Definition of Metric
         A metric is a measurement or numerical calculation of some aspect or characteristic of something that can be used to evaluate performance, predict outcomes or compare different models. In other words, metrics are tools used to quantify the performance of an algorithm or system. 

         Some commonly used metrics in text generation include ROUGE score, METEOR score, BERTScore, SmogIndex etc. These metrics measure the similarity between generated texts and reference texts for various evaluation criteria such as recall rate, precision rate, f1-score, and accuracy.
         
         ### 2.1.2 Different Types of Metrics
         There are several types of metrics used in natural language processing including classification metrics, information retrieval metrics, sequence labelling metrics, translation quality metrics and summarization quality metrics. Text generation tasks involve generating multiple sentences or paragraphs, which makes it challenging to evaluate model performance on all these metrics simultaneously. Consequently, there has been recent research interest in developing multi-task learning techniques that leverage different metrics with shared representations. Commonly used methods for evaluating multitask learning systems include meta-learning and fusion strategies based on multiple losses functions.

         ### 2.1.3 Performance Evaluation in Text Generation
         The most common way to evaluate the performance of a neural network-based text generator is by measuring its ability to generate fluent and coherent text. One simple but effective method is calculating the average word perplexity (AWP) of the predicted output versus human references for a given dataset. This approach measures the overall readability and fluency of the generated text but does not take into account the additional aspects like sentiment, personality traits, style diversity, and linguistic complexity present in generative models.

         To address this limitation, we propose the COMET method, which utilizes multiple metrics to capture more comprehensive aspects of the generated text. We define six categories of metrics: content consciousness, stylistic control, moral balance, diverse expressiveness, fluency, and engagingness. Each category includes one or more specific submetrics. We also develop a framework that integrates these categories together to calculate a composite score called COMETQ, which represents the overall quality of the generated text. Furthermore, our proposed methods enable us to optimize individual metrics while ensuring their complementary contribution towards the final score.


         ## 2.2 Target Variables
         ### 2.2.1 Content Consciousness
         Content consciousness refers to how well the generated text focuses on the core message or ideas of the input. This can be measured through the following subcategories:
          - Comprehensibility: How easy is it for humans to understand and comprehend the generated text? 
          - Specificity: Is the generated text focused on only the relevant topics mentioned in the input? 
          - Relevance: Does the generated text provide new insights beyond what was already discussed in the context? 
          - Novelty: Does the generated text contain unexpected or unusual information compared to existing literature?
          - Persuasiveness: How persuasive is the generated text towards the reader's desired goal?

         ### 2.2.2 Stylistic Control
         Stylistic control involves the degree to which the generated text adheres to predefined styles or guidelines provided by experts. It can be measured through the following subcategories:
          - Grammar Correction: Do the generated text have grammatical errors or omissions? What percentage do they represent?
          - Spelling Mistakes: How many spelling mistakes are there in the generated text?
          - Style Consistency: Is the tone, syntax, and sentence structure consistent throughout the generated text? Are there any discrepancies within certain sections or paragraphs?
          - Punctuation Usage: Is the use of proper punctuation consistent throughout the generated text? Do they help improve the clarity and flow of the text?
          - Fluency: How natural and smooth is the generated text? Can readers follow along without much effort?

         ### 2.2.3 Moral Balance
         Moral balance refers to whether the generated text maintains a balanced level of positive, negative, and neutral language. This can be measured through the following subcategories:
          - Sentimentality: How pleasant or charming is the generated text? How does it portray emotions of trustworthiness, humility, loyalty, kindness, and respect?
          - Credibility: Is the generated text credible, accurate, and truthful?
          - Consistency: Is the tone and voice consistent throughout the generated text? Are there any instances where people may come off as brash or aggressive?

         ### 2.2.4 Diverse Expressiveness
         Diverse expressiveness refers to how creative and imaginative the generated text is. This can be measured through the following subcategories:
          - Imagery: How often do the generated text employ visually stunning images, cartoons, and drawings? How closely related to reality are they?
          - Knowledge Absorption: How knowledgeable, expert, educated, or enlightened is the generated text about subjects unrelated to the input? How can we challenge the system’s assumptions and prejudices?
          - Historical Reference: How accurate is the generated text when referencing historical events and persons from different cultures, religions, and geographies? How robust is the narrative quality and realism of the historical stories embedded in the text?

         ### 2.2.5 Fluency
         Fluency refers to how natural and fluid the generated text sounds. This can be measured through the following subcategories:
          - Mechanics: How fluent and clear is the speech and writing in the generated text? Do speakers make appropriate pauses and hesitations?
          - Rhythm: Does the generated text maintain the right rhythmic patterns, syllables, and phonemes throughout the entire text? Are there any instances where phrases break, flow awkwardly, or sound flat out?
          - Pause Length: Is the length of each pause and hesitation long enough to allow listeners to process the content accurately? Are there any instances where too short a pause or hesitance could hinder understanding?

         ### 2.2.6 Engagingness
         Engagingness refers to how enjoyable and exciting the generated text is. This can be measured through the following subcategories:
          - Humorousness: How funny and irreverent is the generated text? Does it garner laughter from viewers?
          - Interactivity: How interactive and engaging is the generated text? Does it require users to interact with the machine?
          - Personalization: Is the generated text personalized to the user? Does it appeal to emotionally driven readers?
