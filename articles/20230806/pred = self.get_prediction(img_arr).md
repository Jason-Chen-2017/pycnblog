        AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning have been the mainstream fields in recent years. The field of deep learning has gained a great attention recently due to its applications such as image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), object detection, speech recognition and many other tasks.

        In this article, we will cover some key concepts in computer vision including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), pooling layers, fully connected layers and backpropagation algorithm for training the model. We will also present an overview of transfer learning, explain how it helps in reducing the time complexity and accuracy loss while achieving good results on new datasets, and discuss several popular CNN architectures used for various computer vision tasks.

        2.Computer Vision Background

        Computer Vision is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling machines to understand and manipulate digital images or videos. It involves analyzing patterns and structures in visual scenes through algorithms developed by humans using advanced techniques like pattern recognition, geometry, filtering and color analysis. There are three primary components involved in computer vision: 

            1- Image Acquisition - Capturing images from different sources such as cameras, scanners, etc. 
            2- Image Processing - Operations performed on images such as resizing, rotation, sharpening, contrast adjustment, etc. 
            3- Object Recognition - Identifying objects, vehicles, animals, human faces, text, etc. 

        A typical computer vision task typically involves obtaining multiple images of the same scene under varying conditions, performing image processing operations, and identifying specific objects or features in the image. This process requires developing complex algorithms and machine learning models with high computational power.


        3.Key Concepts in Computer Vision

        Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are one of the most popular types of deep learning models for computer vision tasks. CNNs are specifically designed for image recognition tasks where they can automatically extract important features from an input image without any handcrafted feature engineering. Below are some key concepts related to CNN architecture:

        1- Feature Extraction:
            In traditional image processing approaches, features like edges, corners, shapes, textures, colors were extracted manually or by using mathematical functions. In order to improve the performance of CNNs, researchers proposed extracting more abstract features like gradients, local extrema, and spatial statistics directly from raw pixel values. These features can be obtained by applying filters over the entire image or small regions of interest (ROIs).

            To capture these features efficiently, CNNs use two dimensional convolution filters which are multiplied elementwise across all pixels in the ROI. Each filter captures a particular type of feature, e.g., edges, corners, shapes, textures. By stacking several filters together, the network learns to recognize variations in each feature at different scales.

        2- Pooling Layers: 
            After computing the features, CNNs apply pooling layers to reduce the dimensionality of the output volume. Different pooling methods include max pooling, average pooling, and L2 pooling. Max pooling returns the maximum value within the pool region, whereas average pooling computes the mean value of all elements inside the pool region. L2 pooling normalizes the output vector by dividing each element by its L2 norm.

            Pooling layers help in reducing the size of the output volume, thus helping in faster computation and less memory usage. Additionally, pooling layers preserve the spatial relationships between the features, providing additional contextual information about the objects being recognized.

        3- Fully Connected Layer:
            Finally, CNNs take the pooled feature maps generated by the previous layer and feed them into fully connected layers, which are linear classifiers that map the input to the output space. Commonly used activation functions include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), Sigmoid, and Softmax.
            
            The last fully connected layer outputs a probability distribution over the classes detected in the input image, making it a multi-class classification problem. However, if the number of classes is large, only a subset of them may be relevant in the given scenario, hence, cross entropy loss function can be used instead of softmax function. Cross entropy measures the difference between two probability distributions, i.e., target distribution and predicted distribution.
