# 1.简介
         

        Java is a popular programming language used in various domains such as web development, Android mobile app development, enterprise application development and many others. Java arrays are one of the most commonly used data structures available in Java and have multiple applications in various fields such as sorting, searching, manipulating large amounts of data and performing mathematical computations.
        
        In this article, we will be discussing about Java arrays by going through some basic concepts like array declaration, creation, indexing, slicing, copying, iterating over an array using for loop and lambda expressions. We will also explore how to sort an array, search an element in an array, merge two sorted arrays into one, find maximum/minimum elements from an array etc., and finally demonstrate code examples along with explanatory comments explaining each step.

         ## 数组的定义

        An array is a collection of similar type variables arranged in contiguous memory locations starting at a specific address. The size of an array is fixed during its lifetime and cannot change dynamically. Once defined, the values stored within it can be accessed using indices or addresses that specify their relative position inside the array.

         ## 声明数组

        To declare an array, you need to provide the name of the array, followed by square brackets [] and specifying the length of the array which determines the number of elements that it can hold. You can also specify the type of data contained in the array within angle brackets <> after the variable name. Here's an example:

        int[] arr = new int[5]; // declaring an integer array named "arr" with a length of 5

        String[] names = {"John", "Jane", "Bob"}; // declaring a string array named "names" containing three strings - "John", "Jane", "Bob".

         ## 创建数组

        If you want to create an empty array without initializing any value, then use the following syntax:

        double[] emptyArray = new double[10];

        This creates a new array called 'emptyArray' having a length of 10, but no initializers assigned to individual elements. For creating an initialized array, you just assign values to individual elements while defining them. Here's an example:

        char[] vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}; // creating a character array named "vowels" with five characters

        boolean[] boolArr = {true, false, true}; // creating a boolean array named "boolArr" with three boolean values

         ## 访问数组元素

        Accessing an array element involves identifying its index location and retrieving the corresponding value. Indexes start from 0 and end at n-1 where n is the length of the array minus 1. You can access an element of an array either using its index or using the element itself as shown below:

        System.out.println(names[0]);   // accessing first element of the array "names" using its index
        System.out.println(name);       // accessing second element of the array "names" using its declared identifier

        The output of both these statements would be: John

             ## 调整数组大小

        Since Java arrays are fixed in size, if you try to add more elements than the current capacity of the array, the JVM throws an exception. But sometimes you may want your program to grow beyond the current limit, so you can increase the size of an existing array using the `resize()` method provided by the JDK. Here's an example:

        char[] letters = {'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'}; // original character array with 5 elements
        resize(letters, 10);    // increasing the size of the array to 10 elements

        void resize(char[] arr, int newSize){
            char[] temp = new char[newSize];
            for(int i=0; i<Math.min(arr.length, newSize); i++){
                temp[i] = arr[i];
            }
            arr = temp;
        }

        This code declares a temporary character array with the desired size and copies all the old elements of the input array into the resized array. Finally, it updates the reference of the input array to point to the newly resized array. Now when you try to print out the contents of the resized array, they should contain all the previous elements followed by null values up to the required size. 

         ## 用for循环遍历数组

        You can traverse an entire array using a simple for loop and retrieve each element individually using its index as shown below:

        float sum = 0f;
        for(int i=0; i<arr.length; i++){
            sum += arr[i];
        }
        System.out.println("Sum of all elements in the array is: "+sum);

        The above statement calculates the sum of all elements present in the 'arr' array and prints it on the console. 

         ## 使用lambda表达式遍历数组

        Instead of traversing an array manually using a for loop, you can use lambda expression to iterate over every element of the array simultaneously as shown below:

        double maxVal = Double.MIN_VALUE;
        forEach(arr, val -> {
            if(val > maxVal){
                maxVal = val;
            }
        });
        System.out.println("Maximum Value in the Array is: "+maxVal);

        The above code uses the forEach() method provided by the Arrays class to iterate over all the elements of the array 'arr'. It finds the largest element amongst those and stores it in the'maxVal' variable.
