         ## 2.1 AI简介
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a subset of intelligent machines that can learn and make decisions independently without being explicitly programmed to do so. AI has been applied to many fields including computer science, mathematics, psychology, engineering, medicine, finance, and social sciences, etc. It helps humans to improve their decision-making abilities, manage tasks more efficiently, create new products and services, optimize operations, among others. Some popular examples of AI applications in manufacture include predictive analytics for quality control, robotic process automation for production lines, and autonomous vehicles for transportation management.

             Deep learning refers to machine learning techniques based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are composed of multiple layers of interconnected processing units. These models have the ability to learn complex patterns from large amounts of data automatically, unlike traditional statistical or rule-based approaches. Popular deep learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have become particularly effective in solving problems related to image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and time series prediction.

         #### 2.2.1.2 强化学习
             Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward over time. The goal is to find a balance between exploration of new possible states and exploiting known paths through a parameter space. In reinforcement learning, policies are learned by optimizing the agent’s expected return (i.e., the sum of rewards obtained while interacting with the environment). Commonly used algorithms include Q-learning, actor-critic methods, and policy gradient methods.

         #### 2.2.1.3 迁移学习
             Transfer learning refers to transferring knowledge learned from one problem to another similar but different task. This technique allows for significant improvements in performance compared to training the model on the target dataset from scratch. In transfer learning, a pre-trained model is fine-tuned using small datasets specific to the target domain. Pre-trained models may be available publicly or can be trained on large datasets specifically designed for the target domain. For example, Google's MobileNet V2 architecture has achieved state-of-the-art results on ImageNet classification task thanks to its use of transfer learning.
