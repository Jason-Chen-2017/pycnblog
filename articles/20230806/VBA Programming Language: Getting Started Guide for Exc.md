# 1.简介
         

         The Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming language is a powerful tool used by developers to automate Microsoft Office applications such as Excel and Word. It allows users to create macros that can be run on demand or automatically triggered based on user actions in the application itself. In this guide we will introduce you to the basics of VBA programming through hands-on examples using Excel formulas and functions. We will also explore some advanced concepts like arrays, loops, modules and subroutines. Finally, we will discuss best practices when writing code with VBA. By the end of this tutorial, you should feel comfortable writing basic programs using VBA in Excel. 
         This guide assumes that readers have at least a basic understanding of Excel and how it works. If you are new to Excel, please review our article "Excel Beginner's Guide" before proceeding with this one.

         # 2.Basic Concepts & Terms
         ## 2.1 Variables
         VBA uses variables to store values temporarily during program execution. There are three types of variables in VBA:
         - String: A string variable holds any text data between quotation marks (" "). Strings can be combined, modified, or parsed using various methods available in VBA. For example, `strVar = "Hello"` concatenates two strings into one.
         - Numeric: A numeric variable stores a numerical value, either integer or decimal. You can perform mathematical operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), exponentiation (^), etc., on numeric variables. For example, `numVar = numVar + 1` increments `numVar` by 1.
         - Boolean: A boolean variable represents a true/false state, which can only take on these two values. Booleans are often used to make conditional decisions within your macro. For example, `if condition then doSomething()` checks whether the expression `condition` evaluates to True or False and executes the corresponding block of code if so.

         ## 2.2 Constants
         Constant variables cannot change throughout the program execution. They are declared using the `Const` keyword followed by an identifier and its assigned value. For example, `Private Const PI As Double = 3.14159`. 

         ## 2.3 Arrays
         An array is a container that stores multiple values under a single name. Arrays are indexed starting from 1 and can hold different data types such as numbers, dates, text strings, and other arrays. Arrays are created using square brackets (`[]`) and their elements can be accessed using indices surrounded by parentheses. For example, `arr(1) = "apple"` sets the first element of the `arr` array to the string `"apple"`.

         ## 2.4 Ranges
         A range refers to a contiguous set of cells within a worksheet or workbook. Rather than referencing individual cells, ranges simplify working with multiple related cells together. Ranges are identified using letters representing rows and columns, separated by commas. For example, `A1:C5` specifies a range containing all cells in the top left corner to the bottom right corner of a 5x3 table.

         ## 2.5 Modules and Subroutines
         A module is a collection of statements written in VBA that performs specific tasks. Modules are stored in separate files with the file extension `.bas`, while subroutine procedures are contained within modules but can be called independently by other parts of the program. Modules are typically named after the task they accomplish, such as `Module Forms` for event handlers, `Module Math` for math functions, etc. Subroutines are usually named after what action they perform, such as `Sub Calculate` for performing calculations, `Sub UpdateData` for updating database tables, etc. To call a subroutine, simply use its name preceded by the module name and a dot, like `Math.Sqr(number)`.

         ## 2.6 Loops
         Loops allow repeated execution of a portion of code until a certain condition is met. There are four types of loops in VBA:
         - For loop: A simple loop that repeats a fixed number of times. For loops use the `For Each...Next` syntax and iterate over each item in an array or range. For example, `For i = 1 To 10 Step 2` initializes a counter variable `i` to 1 and continues looping until it reaches 10, incrementing by 2 each time.
         - While loop: A more complex loop that repeats until a specified condition is no longer true. While loops use the `While...Wend` syntax and execute the body of the loop as long as the condition remains true. For example, `While i < 10` continues looping as long as `i` is less than 10.
         - Do...Loop statement: Another type of loop where the test condition comes first and the loop body follows. Do...Loop loops work similarly to While loops except that the test condition is checked at the beginning of every iteration rather than afterwards. For example, `Do Until i > 10` initializes a counter variable `i` to 10 and continues looping until it becomes greater than 10.
         - Exit statement: Allows breaking out of a loop prematurely without completing the rest of the iterations. Can be placed anywhere inside the loop body, including within nested loops.

         
         # 3.Algorithm and Operations
         ## 3.1 Adding Text
        To add text to a cell in Excel, you can use the following formula:

        ```
        Cell.Value = "text"
        ```

        This adds the word "text" to the current cell. Alternatively, you could use the `Range` function to specify a range of cells instead of just one:
        
        ```
        Range("A1:B2").Value = Array("hello", "world")
        ```

        This replaces the contents of cells A1 and B1 with "hello" and "world" respectively.

        ## 3.2 Formatting Cells
        You can apply formatting to cells using the `NumberFormat` property. Here are some common formats you might want to use:

        - Currency: `$#,##0.00_);($#,##0.00)`
        - Percentage: `#,##0%;-#,##0%`
        - Date: M/D/YY
        - Time: H:MM AM/PM

        Here is an example of applying currency format to a cell:

        ```
        Cell.NumberFormatLocal = "$#,##0.00_"
        ```

        Note that the local currency symbol may differ depending on the regional settings of the computer running Excel.

        ## 3.3 Working with Tables
        VBA provides several ways to manipulate spreadsheet tables. Here are some common examples:

        ### 3.3.1 Creating a Table
        To create a table in Excel, select the cells you want to include in the table and click Insert -> Table. Then enter the number of rows and columns you need, choose whether you want headers and borders, and customize the look and layout of the table using Table Tools.

        ### 3.3.2 Adding Rows and Columns
        Once you've created a table, you can add or remove rows and columns using the Add and Delete buttons at the bottom of the Table Tools window.

        ### 3.3.3 Sorting Data
        You can sort the data in a table column by selecting the column header and clicking Sort. Or you can manually sort data by setting the `Sort` property of the `Table` object to a specific field or range.

        ### 3.3.4 Filtering Data
        You can filter the data displayed in a table by entering a search term into the Filter field at the top of the Table Tools window.

        ### 3.3.5 Calculating Totals
        You can calculate total row and column sums using the Table Tools. Simply highlight the appropriate cells and click Insert -> Total.

        ### 3.3.6 Merging and Splitting Cells
        You can merge adjacent cells together by clicking Select and then dragging across them. You can split a merged cell back into its original components by double-clicking on the border between them.

        ### 3.3.7 Pasting Data
        You can copy data from another source into a table by using the Paste Special option in Table Tools. Choose "Paste Values Only" to paste only the values themselves, not formatting information.

        ## 3.4 Managing Sheets and Workbooks
        VBA provides several options for managing sheets and workbooks. Some common tasks include:

        ### 3.4.1 Copying and Moving Sheets
        You can copy and move sheets within the same workbook using the `Copy` and `Move` commands in the `Sheets` object. For example, to move sheet "Sheet2" to the next position below sheet "Sheet1", you would use:

        ```
        ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets("Sheet2").Move After:=ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets("Sheet1")
        ```

        ### 3.4.2 Displaying and Hiding Sheets
        You can show or hide sheets within the same workbook using the `Visible` property. For example, to hide sheet "Sheet2", you would use:

        ```
        ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets("Sheet2").Visible = xlSheetHidden
        ```

        ### 3.4.3 Saving and Closing Files
        You can save changes to a workbook using the `Save` method. You can close a workbook using the `Close` method or the Close command in the File menu.
