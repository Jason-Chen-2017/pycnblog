         ## 1.1 Abstract
         
         With the growing popularity and usage of machine learning algorithms in various fields such as data science, finance, and marketing, it becomes necessary to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional datasets with a focus on computational efficiency and speedup of training processes. This article compares several methods for reducing the dimensions of multivariate data: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), Autoencoders, and neural networks based approaches like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). In each method, we discuss its advantages and limitations, identify suitable cases where they can be used, and highlight their strengths over other alternatives. We also provide an overview of popular tools that implement these methods and propose further research directions by analyzing the current state-of-the-art techniques and identifying areas where new developments are needed.

         
         ### 1.1.1 Problem Statement

         The problem of reducing the dimensionality of multivariate data is central to many data analysis tasks. It is especially important when dealing with large datasets that do not fit into main memory or computers. To achieve efficient processing and faster computation times, we need to find ways to represent the complex relationships between variables in lower dimensional spaces while still retaining most of the information from the original dataset. This task requires exploring multiple factors, including algorithmic complexity, interpretability, relevance, and scalability.

         ## 2.Terminology  
         
         Let us begin our discussion by defining some key concepts and terminologies involved in the field of dimensionality reduction. They include:
         
         **Multivariate Data:** Multivariate data refers to a set of independent variables describing different phenomena measured on the same population or subject. Examples of multivariate data include social media posts, medical records, stock market prices, and patient characteristics.

         **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique that transforms a multivariate dataset consisting of possibly correlated variables into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components, which represent the directions of maximum variance in the data. It consists of two stages: first, the covariance matrix of the input dataset is calculated, which represents the relationship between all pairs of variables. Secondly, the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues are selected as the principal components, which describe the directions of maximum variance in the data. Common applications of PCA include image compression, pattern recognition, financial portfolio management, and text mining.

         
         **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA):** Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is another approach to dimensinality reduction that tries to project the dataset onto a smaller subspace that maximizes the class separability. It works by calculating a linear combination of the features that best separates the classes in the dataset. The goal is to transform the dataset into a space with only one direction of highest variance. One application of LDA is dimensionality reduction for text classification problems where the number of features is much larger than the number of samples due to sparsity issues. Another example is the face recognition system that uses LDA to classify faces without relying on handcrafted features.

         
         **Autoencoder:** An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network that learns to compress and decompress its input by finding a bottleneck layer where the compressed representation distorts less but maintains most of the information. It has been widely used for dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, and supervised pretraining tasks in computer vision. Examples of popular autoencoders include deep belief networks (DBNs), stacked denoising autoencoders (SdA), variational autoencoders (VAE), convolutional autoencoders (CAE), and sparse coding.

         
         **Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs):** Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) are shallow neural networks that learn binary representations of high-dimensional data by using a probabilistic approach known as maximum likelihood estimation. RBMs are trained using contrastive divergence (CD-k) algorithm, which alternates between updating the visible units and hidden units until convergence. They are often used for image modeling, collaborative filtering, and topic modeling.
          
         
         **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE):** t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique that converts similarities between data points into probabilities. It employs a cost function that keeps both local and global structure of the data intact. It has become a popular tool for visualizing high-dimensional datasets and generating 2D or 3D embeddings of the data that can be plotted in scatter plots, heat maps, or parallel coordinates plots.

         ## 3.Algorithm Overview and Operations

         
         Now let's dive deeper into each of these methods in detail and understand how they work. In general, there are three common operations performed during dimensionality reduction: feature selection, projection, and lossy approximation. These operations typically involve choosing a subset of variables or applying mathematical transformations to convert the data into a desired form.
         
         
         
         ### 3.1 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
         
         Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a commonly used technique for performing dimensionality reduction in multivariate data. Here are the basic steps involved in PCA:
         
            1. Standardization: Before computing the covariance matrix, standardize the data so that each variable has zero mean and unit variance.
           
           $x_i = \frac{x_i - \mu}{\sigma}$
            
            2. Covariance Matrix: Compute the covariance matrix $\Sigma$ by multiplying the transposed design matrix $X^T$ with itself.
           
           $$\Sigma = X^TX$$
            
            3. Eigendecomposition of Covariance Matrix: Find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix to obtain the principal components.
           
           $$\Sigma v_{i} = \lambda_{i}v_{i}$$  
           
           $\Sigma^{-1}$ gives us the inverse of the covariance matrix.   
           
            4. Projection: Project the data onto the principal components by multiplying the design matrix $X$ with the right singular vectors $u_j$, giving us the transformed dataset $Y$.
           
           $$Y=Xu_j$$
            
            where $u_j$ is the jth column of $U = [u_1, u_2,\ldots,u_p]$ obtained from SVD of $X$:
            
            $$X=USV^T=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sigma_iu_iv_i^T=\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i\cdot u_i)u_iv_i^T$$

            If the top k principal components capture at least 95% of the total variance in the data, then we have reduced the dimensionality to k.
            
         
            5. Variance Explained: Calculate the proportion of variance explained by each principal component to determine whether additional components are required.
            
        | Step | Details |  
        |:-------------:|:-------------:|  
        | Step 1: Standardization | Subtract the mean of each variable from its value and divide by its standard deviation to get zero-mean data with unit variance.<|im_sep|>
