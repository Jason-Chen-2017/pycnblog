##   Introduction
Dark matter is a fundamental particle that has not been detected yet, due to its low mass and very small size compared to our conventional particles such as electrons, muons, or protons. In recent years, various research teams have started exploring how this extraordinary nature of the matter can be detected by observing it directly from its primordial origin in space-time. Theories are based on inflationary models and simulations that predict a dark energy spectrum similar to that of the universe itself. However, the detection rate of extragalactic sources like dark matter remains controversial as it depends heavily on the proper choice of survey techniques and observation strategies. 

In view of these challenges, we propose an approach to detect dark matter with high precision using non-invasive surveys that do not require elevated temperatures or specialized instrumentation. We aim to achieve this through the development of a new generation of multiband radio telescopes that will use spaceborne equipment to transmit signals from the remnants of stars to Earth at frequencies ranging from millihertz (MHz) up to several gigahertz (GHz), which are rare in the electromagnetic spectrum but may allow us to reach even higher sensitivity than current ground-based telescopes. Using these novel technologies, we plan to provide accurate, sensitive measurements of the properties of the primordial black holes themselves without relying upon the massive simulation overheads required by traditional approaches. This paper presents an overview of the technical advances that are needed to achieve this goal, including:

1. Advanced receiver technology - To receive the extremely narrowband signals generated by primordial black hole mergers, we need to develop advanced signal processing techniques that can isolate individual radio frequency signals within milliseconds. Researchers in both theoretical physics and communications engineering are working towards developing suitable demodulation algorithms that can extract information from each signal individually while maintaining their separate phase offsets. 

2. Large number of simultaneous detectors - In order to maximise the sensitivity of our telescopes, we need to install multiple receivers at different locations across the sky to capture all possible variations in the incoming signal strength. In addition to measuring the brightness distribution of each source, we also need to measure its spatial distribution relative to other sources. For this purpose, we need to deploy large arrays of high-gain antennas around the target area. 

3. High sampling rates - As the sensitivity of our telescopes increases, we must also increase the sample rate of our observations so that we can resolve subtle variations in the light curve shape. However, achieving the necessary bandwidth requires sophisticated hardware design and integration into existing networks of telescopes. 

4. New types of compact objects - Despite their massive sizes, some galaxies contain tiny remnants of stellar systems called protostars, which produce non-accelerating massive black holes. These structures may help explain why there is no evidence of a dark energy spectrum elsewhere in the Universe. It is essential to explore these potential progenitors more closely to test their feasibility as probes of dark energy. 

5. Optimal pointing strategy - In order to obtain robust results, we need to choose optimal pointings throughout the night. Therefore, we need to develop flexible automatic targeting methods that can quickly and accurately update the pointing position at any given time during the survey. 

Overall, the proposed technology development project aims to enable a new generation of high-precision measurements of the primordial black holes directly from the Big Bang nucleus. By combining advanced signal processing, array layout, and data management capabilities, we expect to obtain unique insights into the structure, dynamics, and evolution of this unusual particle system. Ultimately, our results will set new standards for astrophysical science and inspire us to pursue unprecedented investigations into this mysterious and pernicious force.
