# 2. Basic principles and terminology
## 2.1 Atoms in solids
In solid state physics, atoms are constituent parts of materials that carry out their various functions such as bonding, hydrogen bonding, strong repulsion, etc. In general terms, an atom is a subatomic particle with three main properties: charge (a positive or negative electric charge), position (an ordered set of spatial coordinates) and spin (a quantum number representing the intrinsic angular momentum). These properties can be studied by studying how they interact with other atomic particles in the system, which results in the creation of electronic configurations called orbitals.
An atom has a valence electron count, which determines its electrical properties such as conductivity, magnetic permeability, etc. An elemental molecule consists of one or more atoms arranged in a crystal structure. Examples of elements include Hydrogen, Oxygen, Carbon, Nitrogen, Silicon, Iron, Magnesium, Calcium, etc. The compounds formed by combining these elements are known as organic molecules, including living things like cells, organs, tissues, etc., and synthetic materials such as metals, polymers, ceramics, etc.
A periodic table lists all the elements of the periodic table and shows their chemical symbols and atomic numbers. The atomic number refers to the number of protons that make up the nucleus of each atom. The standard atomic weights for different elements range from about 1.007 to 208.091 dalton, where 1 dalton equals 1 g/mol.
## 2.2 Periodic Table
The periodic table of elements is used to classify them into groups based on their symmetry and chemical properties. Each row represents a single period, starting at the group of the first element through to the last element in the third period. Columns represent different classes or categories of elements depending on their physical properties. For example, there are sixteen rows representing the eight primary alkaline earth metals, sixteen columns representing non-metallic elements and metalloids, and twenty four boxes containing radioactive elements.
Each cell in the periodic table contains information regarding a particular element, including its symbol, name, atomic number, and atomic weight. Click on any cell to get detailed information about the selected element. Additionally, you can use search bar to find specific elements using their names, symbols, or atomic numbers.
