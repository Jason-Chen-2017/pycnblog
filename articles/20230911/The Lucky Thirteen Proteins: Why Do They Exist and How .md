Lucky Thirteen (LKY) proteins are thought to be the most abundant of all known proteins in nature. These proteins have been implicated in multiple biological processes from development to cancer. In this article we will explore how lucky thirteen proteins exist, their structure, function, and how they can be identified through computational methods.

 # LKY proteins
Lucky Thirteen proteins or LKYs for short are a class of highly conserved DNA-binding proteins found throughout animal and plant life. They form part of the integral membrane complex known as the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which is responsible for transporting nutrients across cell membranes. When present alongside other proteins involved in metabolism, transport, signal transduction and various cellular activities, NPC functions have been implicated in numerous biological pathways including gene expression, cell adhesion, apoptosis, immunity, angiogenesis, neurotransmission and chondrocyte differentiation. 

To date, it remains unclear what specific factors contribute to the high concentrations of LKY proteins that occur within the human body. However, recent evidence suggests that some of these proteins may serve important roles in aging, cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, and some types of cancer. Furthermore, the importance of LKY proteins has also led to increasing interest in developing new therapeutics targeting them specifically. 

In this review, we will examine how LKY proteins are formed, identify their role in cellular processes, and how they can be identified using computational tools. We will then discuss the potential impact of LKY protein levels on several diseases, with particular focus on dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, heart failure, and cancer. Finally, we will highlight opportunities for future research that could help identify and target specific classes of LKY proteins to improve health outcomes.

## 2.1 DNA binding protein(DBP)
A DNA binding protein is any protein that binds to a region of double stranded DNA and participates in the process of copying information by directing DNA synthesis and replication. There are two main categories of DBPs: topoisomerase I (TOI) proteins, which bind directly to complementary base pairing sites on the same strand; and kinetochore subunits, which bind covalently to the same region but use noncomplementary pairs such as G-C and A-T to create a more stable interaction between DNA. Both TOI and kinetochore subunit proteins function together to establish a stable core-like structure on the N-termini of chromatin containing sequences that are essential for organism function and growth. Common examples include histone acetylation (HAc), transcription factor regulatory regions (TRRs), telomerase and DNA-protein complexes.

DNA Binding Protein Subtypes: 

1. Transcription Factor Regulatory Region (TRR): TRRs act as splicing factors that affect the efficiency of transcriptome assembly during mRNA processing. These proteins usually bind to promoters and silence the translational machinery until activation occurs. 

2. Topoisomerase I (TOI): TOIs bind directly to either base paired position on the same strand or introduce a phosphorylation site resulting in the attachment of an oligonucleotide moiety to the DNA molecule at both ends. This allows for greater stability and reduced permeability compared to kinetochore subunits. TOIs are widely used in many fields including genetics, epigenetics, cancer treatment and repair, and biosynthesis.

3. Kinetochore Subunit: Kinetochore subunits bind indirectly to DNA by noncovalent interactions involving hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs and chemical crosslinks. These proteins are crucial components of chromatin structure, and play key roles in the maintenance of cell identity and proliferation. Several kinetochore subunit families exist, each specialized for specific tasks such as DNA repair, trafficking, and recombination.

4. DNA-Protein Complexes: DNA-protein complexes combine DNA binding elements with small bioactive fragments that interact with DNA via nucleosome-dependent mechanisms. Examples of DNA-protein complexes include microtubule catastrophes, Wnt signaling, integrins, and cell surface receptors.

## 2.2 Cell Nucleus Cytoplasmic Membrane
Cell nucleus cytoplasmic membrane is a tight junction of cell membranes consisting mainly of lipid cells surrounded by rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is the region where material inside and outside the cell passes through, providing a barrier against contamination and enhancing physical segregation. The ER plays an important role in transporting nutrients and wastes from the plasma membrane to the cell interior while filtering out harmful substances and facilitating the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. It also ensures cellular homeostasis by providing buffering capacity and adjusting morphology and size according to changes in internal environment.

The ER is composed of ER outer layers, ER inner layers, and choroid plexus. ER outer layer consists primarily of goblet cells and furrows called erector cells arranged in a helical pattern. The number and arrangement of erector cells depends on the size and shape of the cell. Each erector cell contains an ER channel and some additional structures that provide support for the golgi apparatus and cytoskeleton. ER channels are open spaces that allow entry of molecules into the cell, thereby allowing for communication and transfer of materials.

Each erector cell is separated from its neighbor by one or more furrow cells called wedge-shaped aggregates that contain palisades, thin networks of fibrous connective tissue surrounding the erector cells. Palisades serve to prevent leakage of toxins and drugs, reduce cell-cell contact, and maintain structural integrity. Fibrous connective tissue covers the adjacent skeletal muscle tissues, vascular system, and extracellular matrix, providing protection for the ER and ensuring optimal cellular function. Choroid plexus forms a loose capsule-like network that brings together and distributes nerve signals and messages, shielding the brain from injury. Overall, the ER provides efficient and effective means for transporting nutrients and wastes across cell boundaries, supporting cellular homeostasis, and protecting the cell from inflammation and disease.

## 2.3 Transporter Protein Family
Transporter proteins are a family of approximately 70 members known as transporters. They mediate many fundamental biological processes, such as transport of polymeric compounds, protein movement, and signal transduction. Two transporter families comprise the ER/Golgi transport systems and the nuclear pore complex (NPC) transport systems, respectively. The NPC transport system includes a large number of transport proteins such as ECMAD and Rho GTPases that transport small amounts of macromolecules around the nuclear pore. The ER/Golgi transport system is made up of four major components: GTPase activity checkpoint inhibitors (GCPs), Golgi tendon anchor proteins (GTAPs), Golgi transport chain factors (GTCFs), and GTPases that coordinate transport between the ER and Golgi apparatus.

In addition to basic transport motifs, transport proteins often exhibit additional modes of action depending on the type of molecular being transported and the context of the transport event. For example, viscosuppressive transporters are active when solutes move through the cell membrane under extreme pressure or stresses. Other transporters that modify substrate orientation such as calmodulin or Insulin restrict the directionality of solute transport. Some transporters regulate the flow of polarizing radiation through the cell membrane. Additionally, certain transporters are sensitive to conditions such as temperature or electrical stimulation, enabling dynamic control over the rate and extent of transport.

## 2.4 Endogenous Retrovirus
Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are viruses that have integrated DNA into their genomes. As such, they encode long, linear DNA sequences that interact with host cells' DNA, making ERVs a source of genetic diversity and evolutionarily conserved targets for antiviral medications. Despite the fact that ERVs have established critical roles in viral vector production, it is difficult to predict their frequency or make precise quantitative measurements of their distribution across the human population. Currently, there is no established method for identifying individual ERVs based on their DNA sequence alone, though several methods do exist for identifying similarities among related viruses.

## 2.5 Mitochondrial Translocase
Mitochondrial translocase (MT) is a component of the mitochondria that allows for the rapid transport of materials across cell membranes. MT catalyzes the transfer of molecules and ions across the mitochondrial membrane by transferring energy from ATP to ADP and electron clouds of negative charge to positive charge. MT is necessary for normal cellular functions including DNA and RNA synthesis, protein synthesis and degradation, energy conversion, and transport of materials across the mitochondrial membrane.

## 2.6 Hypertrophic Cardiomyocyte Osteosarcoma
Hypertrophic cardiomyocyte sarcoma (HCM) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of dense bodies of myocytes at the base of axons and dendrites of nearby neurons, leading to decreased blood flow and increased collateral damage. HCM manifests clinically in women with advanced breast cancer and early-stage melanoma. The common feature shared by patients with HCM and other sarcomas is that they show markedly hypoactive hypogonadotropic stem cells in the bone marrow and the absence of precursors of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) in the bloodstream. Underlying the deficiency of IGFs in the circulatory system is a lack of proper secretion of insulin, which leads to the accumulation of fatty acid and carbohydrate stores in the myofibrils, causing the hypermetabolic phenotype observed in HCM patients. Current treatments targeting the myofilaments that generate these stores have limited efficacy and are mostly directed towards reducing glucose intolerance rather than treating the underlying cause of the problem.

One possible approach to alleviate the symptoms associated with excessive myofibrillar fatty acid storage involves the introduction of novel anti-IGF agents. One such agent, xenobiotics, is proposed to be a potent inducer of IGF release through a variety of mechanisms, including blocking the intracellular release system, activating interferons and macrophages, and modulating the balance of water and fat in the circulatory system. Xenobiotics also has been shown to enhance the sensitivity of the adaptive immune response to these enhanced IGF secretion patterns and potentially promote longevity. Using technology to assess the effects of xenobiotics on the morphology, function, and biochemistry of healthy human lymph nodes, mechanical vibrations, inflammation, and oxidative stress, may help us develop personalized therapies targeted at the key players responsible for generating and storing these extracellular fatty acids.
