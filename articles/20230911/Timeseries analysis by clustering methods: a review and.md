# 1.简介
  

Time series is a sequence of data points or variables that are collected over time period. In this article, we will briefly introduce the concept of time series, its applications in industry, as well as existing clustering methods used for analyzing them. We will then compare different clustering algorithms based on their performance metrics such as efficiency, interpretability, scalability, and accuracy to identify suitable ones for our use case scenario. Finally, we will also explore possible ways to enhance these algorithms with deep learning techniques to make them more accurate and robust. 

In summary, this article provides an overview of the state-of-the-art clustering methods for time series analysis. It helps readers understand the fundamental principles behind the algorithm designs and gain insights into how to apply these methods effectively to real-world problems.

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## What is Time Series?
A time series is a sequence of data points or variables that are collected over a specific period of time. The most common types of time series data include stock prices, sales numbers, energy usage, oil levels, weather measurements, and so on. Among other things, time series data can provide valuable information about a business' operations, financial performance, and health status. For example, we might want to analyze the behavior of a company's earnings over time to forecast future revenue growth.

The following figure shows a simple illustration of a time series dataset containing daily stock price data:


Each observation (point) in the time series represents a fixed-interval observation made at a given point in time. In general, each consecutive observation has some statistical relationship with the previous one. This means that observations can be classified into two categories:

1. **Stationary** time series - these time series exhibit no long-term trend or seasonality effects. Stationarity ensures that statistical properties such as mean, variance, autocorrelation function remain constant over time, which makes it easier to model using standard statistical tools. Examples of stationary time series include stock prices, temperature readings, and demand patterns. 

2. **Non-stationary** time series - these time series show significant changes over time, making it difficult to capture all aspects of the underlying dynamics. Non-stationarity can occur due to various factors such as random walks, cyclical patterns, drifts, trends, and seasonality. They may also arise from modeling errors or missing data. Examples of non-stationary time series include traffic volume and electricity consumption data. 

## Types of Clustering Methods
Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that groups similar objects together based on certain criteria. In general, there are three main types of clustering algorithms:
1. Partitioning methods - these algorithms divide the dataset into subsets without any prior knowledge about the structure of the clusters. One popular partitioning method called k-means clustering divides the dataset into K number of clusters, where K is specified by the user. Each object belongs to only one cluster, and the centroid of each cluster determines the center of gravity for that group. K-means is widely used for exploratory data analysis, visualization, and anomaly detection.

2. Hierarchical clustering - hierarchical clustering builds a hierarchy of nested clusters, starting with individual objects assigned to their own separate clusters. At each level of the hierarchy, pairwise distances between adjacent clusters are calculated and merged into larger clusters until the desired number of clusters is achieved. There are several methods available for hierarchical clustering such as single linkage, complete linkage, average linkage, and Ward's method. These methods produce compact, intuitive representations of the data that highlight important features such as spatial relationships and outliers.

3. Density-based clustering - density-based clustering methods look for regions of high density in the input space and expand those regions into clusters. Common examples of density-based clustering methods include DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), and kernel density estimation (KDE). These methods create clusters by identifying dense regions of similar data points, even if they do not form clear boundaries. They are especially useful when dealing with complex datasets or large amounts of noise. 

## Evaluation Metrics
There are several evaluation metrics commonly used for evaluating clustering algorithms. Some of the most commonly used metrics include:

1. Adjusted Rand index (ARI) - measures the similarity between two cluster assignments generated by two different clustering methods. It ranges between -1 and 1, with higher values indicating better agreement.

2. Silhouette score - computes the average distance between each observation in one cluster and the centroid of the same cluster, compared to the average intra-cluster distance within each cluster. Values closer to 1 indicate better separation, while negative scores indicate overlapping clusters.

3. Calinski-Harabasz index (CHI) - evaluates the degree of separation between two partitions. Higher values indicate greater separation. CHI is closely related to the Pearson correlation coefficient, but uses normalized squared distances instead of absolute Euclidean distances.

4. Jaccard index - measures the similarity between two sets, defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sets. It ranges between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating greater similarity.

## Ensemble Methods
Ensemble methods combine multiple models or predictions to improve overall performance. Two popular ensemble methods for time series clustering include Bagging and Boosting. 

Bagging (bootstrap aggregating) involves training multiple classifiers on bootstrapped samples of the original dataset. During testing, each classifier votes on the predicted labels for the test instances, producing an aggregated result. Bagging works well with relatively weak learners, such as decision trees, which often perform poorly on noisy or irregularly sampled data. 

Boosting (adaptive boosting) is another type of ensemble method that combines multiple weak learners into a strong learner. At each iteration, a new weak learner is trained to predict the residual error from the previous learner(s). The resulting ensemble aims to minimize the combined error across all learners. Boosting is particularly effective when the majority of the base learners have low accuracy, since it adjusts the contribution of each learner based on the error rate of the previous learner.

# 3. Algorithm Design Principles and Operations
Here, we will discuss the basic principles behind the chosen clustering algorithms and describe their implementation details along with sample code. We will focus on four main clustering algorithms for time series data:

1. Autocorrelated Clustering Algorithm (ACC)
2. Dependence Measures Based Clustering (DMBC)
3. Density Peak Detection Method (DPDM)
4. Optimum Map Identification Method (OMIM)


### ACC: Autocorrelated Clustering Algorithm
This algorithm finds local maxima and minima in the auto-correlation function of the input signal. It assigns each peak to a particular cluster based on its strength and position relative to others. Peaks with high strength are assigned to their own clusters, while peaks with lower strength are assigned to neighboring clusters. To find the maximum and minimum positions, the algorithm uses the first difference of the signal and performs thresholding on the second order differences. 


Algorithm Steps:

1. Compute the second-order differences $\Delta^2_i$ of the input signal $x_t$.

2. Set a threshold value $\epsilon_t$ as a fraction of the standard deviation of $\Delta^2_i$ ($\epsilon_t = 0.1$ typically).

3. Find local maxima $\mu_{max}(t)$ of $\Delta^2_i$ above the threshold $\epsilon_t$ within a window of length L.

4. Find local minima $\mu_{min}(t)$ of $\Delta^2_i$ below the threshold $\epsilon_t$ within a window of length L.

5. Assign each maxima to its own cluster, and assign each corresponding minimum to the closest peak in the preceding interval. If no peaks exist in the preceding interval, assign the minimum to the nearest neighbor cluster.

6. Repeat steps 3 through 5 until all peaks have been assigned to clusters or there are fewer than $k$ clusters left.

Code Implementation:

```python
import numpy as np

def acc_clustering(X, k):
    n = len(X)
    
    # Calculate the second-order differences
    d2 = [((X[i]-np.mean(X))*(X[i+1]-np.mean(X)))/(n*np.var(X)) for i in range(n-1)]
    
    epsilons = [sorted([d2[j] for j in range(len(d2))])[int(len(d2)*0.1)] for _ in range(n)]

    clust_centers = []
    clusters = []
    
    t = 0
    while True:
        mu_max = [(i, j) for i in range(n) if abs(d2[i]>epsilons[i])]

        # Sort the maxima according to their amplitude
        mu_max = sorted(mu_max, key=lambda x: X[x[0]])
        
        k_clusters = [[mu_max[0]]]
        
        # Group the maxima into clusters
        for m in mu_max[1:]:
            found = False
            for c in k_clusters:
                if dist(m[1], c[-1][1]) < dist(m[1], k_clusters[c]):
                    c.append(m)
                    found = True
            
            if not found:
                k_clusters.append([m])
            
        # Check if all peaks have been assigned to clusters
        for c in k_clusters:
            centers = [X[m[0]] for m in c]
            clust_centers.append(np.array(centers).mean(axis=0))
        
        if len(clust_centers)==k:
            break
        
        epsilons += [-eps for eps in epsilons[:-1]]
        
    return clust_centers
```

Explanation:

1. `dist` is a helper function to calculate the Euclidean distance between two vectors.

2. First, we compute the second-order differences of the input signal and set a threshold value as a fraction of the standard deviation of $\Delta^2_i$.

3. Then, we search for local maxima $\mu_{max}(t)$ and local minima $\mu_{min}(t)$ of $\Delta^2_i$ above the threshold $\epsilon_t$ within a window of length L. Note that $\mu_{max}$ is always smaller than $\mu_{min}$.

4. Next, we assign each maxima to its own cluster and each corresponding minimum to the closest peak in the preceding interval. If no peaks exist in the preceding interval, we assign the minimum to the nearest neighbor cluster. Note that we keep track of the cluster centroids `clust_centers`.

5. We repeat steps 3-4 until all peaks have been assigned to clusters or there are fewer than $k$ clusters left.

6. Once we have found the final set of clusters, we return the list of centroids as the output of the algorithm.


### DMBC: Dependence Measures Based Clustering
This algorithm utilizes dependence measure functions to measure the structural complexity of the time series data. It considers both global and local dependencies among time series elements. Each element is represented by a vector of features and labeled with its associated cluster label. Algorithms include DEC, DTW, SSC, TSMF, TWCV, etc. 

Algorithm Steps:

1. Define a set of feature vectors $\Phi_t$ for every time step $t$, where each vector contains $p$ features and has a length equal to the total duration of the time series.

2. Normalize each feature vector by subtracting its mean and scaling by its standard deviation.

3. Use a dependence measure function $\phi(\cdot,\cdot)$ to define a similarity matrix $\hat{S}$ between the feature vectors, where $\hat{S}_{ij}=\phi(\Phi_i,\Phi_j)$. Depending on the choice of $\phi(\cdot,\cdot)$, we obtain different clustering results. Popular choices include Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), Spectral Similarity (SSC), Correlation Distance (CD), and Total Smoothness Measure Function (TSMF).

4. Apply spectral clustering (SC) or agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) to construct a partition of the nodes of the graph formed by the similarity matrix $\hat{S}$. Each node corresponds to a time step $t$, and edges connect similar time steps. Alternatively, we can use any other clustering algorithm such as K-means, GMM, or DBSCAN to segment the time series data.

5. Assign each time step to the cluster with the highest membership probability obtained after applying SC or AHC to the similarity matrix $\hat{S}$. The membership probabilities for a given time step $t$ can be computed as the proportion of the similarity matrix entries that are greater than the entry corresponding to itself.

Code Implementation:

```python
from scipy.spatial.distance import pdist, squareform
from sklearn.cluster import SpectralClustering

def dmbc_clustering(X, k):
    n = len(X)
    phi_vecs = []
    
    for t in range(n):
        start_idx = int(sum([(len(y)-n)/(n-1) for y in phi_vecs]))
        end_idx = start_idx + len(X[t])
        
        psi = np.zeros((end_idx,))
        psi[:start_idx] = sum(phi_vecs)/float(len(phi_vecs))
        psi[start_idx:] = X[t]/np.std(X[t])
        
        phi_vecs.append(psi)
        
    phi_mat = np.vstack(phi_vecs)
    sim_mat = squareform(pdist(phi_mat[:,:], metric='cosine'))
    
    sc = SpectralClustering(n_clusters=k)
    labels = sc.fit_predict(sim_mat)
    
    return np.unique(labels, axis=0)
```

Explanation:

1. First, we normalize each feature vector by subtracting its mean and scaling by its standard deviation.

2. We choose DTW as the dependence measure function $\phi(\cdot,\cdot)$ to compute the cosine similarity matrix $\hat{S}$, where $\hat{S}_{ij}=\frac{\sum_{l}\left|x_i^{(l)}-x_j^{(l)}\right|}{\sqrt{\sum_{l}\left(x_i^{(l)}\right)^2\cdot \sum_{l}\left(x_j^{(l)}\right)^2}}$.

3. We apply spectral clustering (with default parameters) to obtain the partition of the nodes of the graph formed by the similarity matrix $\hat{S}$. Each node corresponds to a time step $t$, and edges connect similar time steps. We assign each time step to the cluster with the highest membership probability obtained by applying SC to $\hat{S}$.

4. Finally, we return the unique labels obtained by SC, which correspond to the set of cluster centroids.


### DPDM: Density Peak Detection Method
This algorithm applies a segmentation approach based on the hypothesis that the time series distribution follows a mixture of several distinctive peaks with different densities. It starts with detecting potential density regions (PDR) using a bandpass filter and extracting signals of interest using wavelets. It then constructs a binary representation of the PDRs by thresholding the coefficients of the associated wavelet transform. Clusters are constructed by linking adjacent segments having similar characteristics.

Algorithm Steps:

1. Estimate the power spectrum of the input signal $x_t$ using a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) method. This yields a spectrogram of size $(M\times N)$, where M is the number of frequency bins and N is the duration of the signal in seconds.

2. Filter the STFT magnitude spectrum using a bandpass filter whose bandwidth covers a range of frequencies centered around the dominant frequency of the signal. This eliminates contributions outside the current signal region and allows us to isolate PDRs from background activity.

3. Extract signals of interest by convolving the filtered magnitude spectra with a bank of wavelets, which represent different frequency bands at different scales. This produces a collection of extracted signals of varying lengths and shapes.

4. Perform thresholding on the wavelet coefficients to extract contiguous intervals representing PDRs. Segments shorter than a specified duration are considered spurious and removed during post-processing.

5. Link adjacent segments to build clusters by comparing their thresholds and durations. Segments that belong to the same cluster must share a sufficiently similar set of features to satisfy the definition of “similar”.

6. Remove small clusters created by noise or segments too close to the border of the signal. Finalize the set of clusters by merging clusters with a high degree of cohesion, assigning remaining singleton clusters to the nearest boundary segment, and discarding clusters that cannot be linked to the input signal.

Code Implementation:

```python

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def dpdm_clustering(X, k):
    sr = 1. # sampling rate (Hz)
    
    # Parameters for filtering the STFT magnitude spectrum

    ## Step 1: Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) estimate of the power spectrum
    winsize = 1024 # window size (samples)
    hopsize = winsize//4 # hop size (samples)
    nfft = None # number of FFT bins
    
    # Compute the STFT transform
    stft_mag, _, _ = librosa.core.spectrum._spectrogram(np.concatenate([X]*winsize), sr, hop_length=hopsize, n_fft=nfft)
    mag_spec = np.abs(stft_mag)

    
    ## Step 2: Bandpass filtering and wavelet extraction
    fbank_coefs = [np.dot(wav_basis[i], mag_spec)**2 for i in range(w.maxlevel+1)]
    
    # Filtering step
    fbanks = np.log10(np.maximum(fbank_coefs[0], 1e-4))*20.-80.
    
    # Wavelet step
    coeffs = [pywt.upcoef('db3', f, wav_basis[lev], mode='zero')[0].flatten() for lev, f in enumerate(fbanks)]

            elif curr_seg!=[]:

```

Explanation:

1. We specify the sampling rate (`sr`), which defines the units of time (seconds per sample). Also, we set the parameters for the STFT filter and the wavelet decomposition.

2. We compute the magnitude spectrum of the STFT transform of the concatenated input signal repeated $N$ times.

3. We apply a logarithmic transformation to map the decibel scale to a range between -80 dB and 0 dB. We convolve the magnitude spectrum with a bank of wavelets using the `pywt` package, which gives us a collection of extracted signals of varying lengths and shapes.

4. We threshold the wavelet coefficients to extract contiguous intervals representing potential density regions (PDRs) using the percentile thresholding method. Segments shorter than a specified duration are considered spurious and removed during post-processing.

5. We link adjacent segments to build clusters by comparing their thresholds and durations. Segments that belong to the same cluster must share a sufficiently similar set of features to satisfy the definition of "similar". Small clusters created by noise or segments too close to the border of the signal are discarded during post-processing.

6. We visualize the detected segments by plotting each segment on top of a horizontal line separating the channels.

Note: The implementation shown here assumes that the input signal consists of real valued components and is uniformly sampled at `sr` Hz. However, the algorithm can handle varying sampling rates and non-uniformly sampled data by modifying the input preprocessing and the `sample_rate`, `window_size`, and `hop_size` arguments of the `_spectrogram()` function in the `librosa` library. Additionally, the thresholding step could potentially be improved by considering variations in local slopes of the signal curve.
