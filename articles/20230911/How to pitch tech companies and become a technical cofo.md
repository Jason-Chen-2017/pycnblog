In this article, we will cover five main areas of what it takes to pitch an idea for a technology-based company to a potential investor: 
1) Market Research: Understanding the market, competition, and anticipating customer needs.
2) Product Design: Creating a compelling product that aligns with target audience, has clear value proposition, and is easy to use.
3) Business Model Canvas: Developing a simple yet effective business model canvas that clearly defines how revenue is generated from your product or service.
4) Financial Analysis: Conducting a thorough financial analysis that includes valuation, cash flow projections, dividend yield, and other key metrics such as ROI and market share.
5) Pitch Deck: Crafting a high-level pitch deck that explains the product and its benefits to the potential investors, outlining their investment criteria and preferences, as well as any legal considerations.
We'll also discuss several ways you can go about becoming a technical cofounder at these companies after you've pitched them.
Before jumping into each section in detail, let's begin by understanding some basic concepts related to technology companies and finance.

# 2. Basic Concepts & Terminology
## Tech Companies vs Financial Institutions
Technology companies are typically organizations that rely on software and hardware systems to perform tasks more efficiently and effectively than they could do manually. Examples include Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft. These companies sell products or services directly to consumers via websites, mobile apps, or physical retail stores. However, unlike traditional businesses, technology companies don't have a physical presence in the real world, so they must rely on economies of scale to make a profit. This makes them differentiated in many ways from financial institutions, which provide banking services like mortgages and savings accounts to individuals, families, and small businesses.

## Equity vs Debt Funds
Equity funds are structured around a few principles that ensure long-term stability, growth, and returns over time. They usually have a structure where owners own a portion of the fund and may be able to buy back shares at a discount if there are excessive prices. Examples include Vanguard, Barclays, HSBC, and JP Morgan.

Debt funds, on the other hand, are designed to generate quick returns but may not offer the same level of stability or flexibility over time. Instead, debt funds take longer to accrue interest, require higher initial investments, and may be subject to federal regulations. Examples include Citi, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Chase.

It's important to note that equity and debt funds aren't mutually exclusive and can be used together within one portfolio to create diversified portfolios that meet specific risk appetites.

## Shareholders' Rights
Shareholders rights are protections afforded to all shareholders of a company under certain conditions. One example is the right to vote on major issues, influence the direction of strategic planning, and participate in elections. These rights are enforced through various legal documents such as bylaws, articles of incorporation, constitution, and stock option agreements. All shareholders are entitled to receive income, distributions, tax benefits, dividends, and other beneficial ownership privileges.

## Term Sheet
A term sheet is a document submitted to an investor before making an offering. It provides information about the proposed investment including the scope, pricing, terms, risks, and performance expectations of the company being offered. The purpose of a term sheet is to demonstrate commitment to the project by the investor. Once the investor agrees to purchase the company, the term sheet becomes a legal agreement between the parties and establishes the terms upon which the transaction occurs. A term sheet can be customized according to the requirements of the specific industry or investment process.

## ICO (Initial Coin Offering)
An Initial Coin Offering (ICO) refers to the sale of cryptocurrency tokens that represent units of a new digital asset created by an individual or organization. Tokens are initially issued at a predetermined price, and later distributed amongst participants who contribute towards the development of the platform. The token acts as a security that represents ownership in the project, providing intrinsic value beyond the equivalent fiat currency amount. As the ecosystem grows and more users join the network, the demand for the token increases, creating a healthy and thriving token economy.
