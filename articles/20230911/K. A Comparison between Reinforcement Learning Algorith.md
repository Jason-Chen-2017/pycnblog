# 1.简介
  

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a field of machine learning that focuses on how software agents learn to make decisions under uncertainty based on feedback from the environment. RL algorithms are widely used in robotics and AI fields for training intelligent machines to perform complex tasks like autonomous driving or playing games. However, there has been little research done to compare different reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous action spaces where actions can be taken at any value within a certain range. This article provides an overview of different deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms that have been implemented using continuous action spaces by comparing their performance and their strengths and weaknesses.

## Actions
In this context, “action” refers to the change that an agent makes in its environment as a result of taking an input signal. In other words, it represents the desired output from the agent and defines what behavior it wants to achieve. For example, when we talk about controlling our car by pressing the accelerator pedal, we are making an action - either increasing or decreasing speed depending on whether we push the pedal forward or backward. The action space describes all possible actions that the agent can take given a specific state of the environment. It contains both discrete and continuous variables. In the case of discrete actions, each action corresponds to one of a finite set of values. On the other hand, in the case of continuous actions, each variable can take a real-valued number within a specified range. Therefore, the action space includes infinite combinations of potential actions.
## Rewards
The goal of any RL algorithm is to maximize long term rewards provided by the environment. Each time step, the agent takes an action which results in some reward being obtained. Rewards can be positive or negative, but they do not directly influence the agent’s decision-making process. Instead, rewards determine the importance of different states in terms of their desirability. Intuitively, if an agent receives a high reward consistently over many consecutive steps, then it may choose to explore more frequently to find better options. Similarly, if the agent receives low rewards infrequently, it might decide to exploit its current knowledge and concentrate on learning faster to achieve higher long term rewards.
## States
The environment in which the agent operates is described by a state space that includes information about its surroundings. At each time step, the agent observes its immediate surroundings and reacts accordingly by selecting an appropriate action. As with actions, the state space consists of both discrete and continuous variables. In the former case, the state space is typically a fixed set of values that represent various aspects of the environment such as position, velocity, orientation etc. In the latter case, the state space can include continuous variables such as temperature, pressure, acceleration, force applied by the agent, etc., allowing for much richer representations of the underlying environment.
## Agent
An agent is anything that interacts with the environment through actions and receives feedback through rewards. An agent could be a person, animal, or even a piece of hardware that performs automated tasks without human intervention. Understanding how an agent works requires understanding the four core components mentioned above - actions, rewards, states, and agent. There are several types of agents: deterministic, stochastic, model-based, and hybrid agents. We will briefly describe these here:

1. Deterministic Agents: These agents always act according to a predetermined policy regardless of the current state of the world. They work well in environments with a known, fixed reward structure. Examples of deterministic agents include traditional programming languages like C++, Python, Java, and MATLAB. 

2. Stochastic Agents: These agents generate probability distributions over possible actions and choose actions randomly based on those probabilities. Examples of stochastic agents include decision trees, neural networks, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and Q-learning. 

3. Model-Based Agents: These agents use models learned from experience to predict future rewards and optimal actions. These methods often require accurate models of the system dynamics and observation noise. Examples of model-based agents include dynamic programming, temporal difference (TD), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). 

4. Hybrid Agents: These agents combine multiple strategies to balance exploration and exploitation during training. They incorporate prior knowledge into the decision-making process and adapt to changing circumstances through probabilistic inference. Examples of hybrid agents include imitation learning, transfer learning, meta-learning, and Bayesian optimization. 

## Environment
The environment is defined as the outside world in which the agent exists and interacts with. The environment influences the agent's performance and trajectory by providing information about its natural laws, objects, and constraints. Some examples of environments include physical systems such as vehicles, factories, traffic flow maps; virtual environments such as simulated games or maze-solving problems; social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook; biological systems such as living organisms and microorganisms; financial markets, stock prices, and weather forecasts; and digital systems such as cloud infrastructure and web applications. While designing an RL agent, we need to ensure that the chosen environment is rich enough to provide valuable observations and challenges the agent to learn skills beyond simple trial-and-error learning.
## Markov Decision Process
A Markov decision process (MDP) is a mathematical framework for modeling sequential decision-making problems. It specifies the transitions between states of the environment, the available actions at each state, the expected return after taking an action, and the termination condition for an episode. MDPs allow us to formulate reinforcement learning problems as a sequence of interactions between the agent and the environment. Each interaction involves choosing an action, observing the next state, and receiving a scalar reward. By doing so, the agent learns by efficiently finding the best strategy to achieve maximum cumulative reward across all possible actions. One popular variant of MDP called Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) allows the agent to only observe part of the environment at each time step, leading to more efficient computation compared to full observability. However, POMDPs are less commonly used in practice due to their complexity and limited practicality.
