随着深度学习技术的发展和突飞猛进的应用在医疗领域，对于如何利用深度学习模型进行医学图像分析以及如何提升模型的性能、效果，越来越成为一个重要的话题。近年来随着医学图像数据的复杂性、规模以及多样性的增加，传统的机器学习方法已经无法应对这种数据的高维度特征和非结构化的形式，而深度学习模型能够解决这一难题。本文将通过图景介绍深度神经网络中的迁移学习，并以在医学图像分析领域的案例——肝脏灰质超声检查X-ray图像分类为切入点，详细阐述迁移学习相关知识点。

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminologies
## Introduction to Transfer Learning
Transfer learning is a technique that allows us to leverage knowledge gained from one task and apply it to another related but different task. In this case, we use the knowledge learned on a source domain (e.g., image classification) to improve performance on a target domain (e.g., X-ray diagnosis). The key idea behind transfer learning is to reuse features learned by the model on the source dataset instead of starting from scratch. This can significantly reduce training time and make the resulting models more robust to new input data. 

## Types of Transfer Learning
There are several types of transfer learning methods:

1. Feature Extraction vs. Fully Connected Layers
   We can divide transfer learning into two categories based on whether we want to replace or add layers at the top of the network while fine-tuning. If we only want to extract features from the last few fully connected layers of a pre-trained model, then called feature extraction transfer learning. On the other hand, if we want to keep all layers intact except for the final output layer, then called fully connected transfer learning. 
   
2. Domain Adaptation vs. Task Adaptation
    Another distinction is between domain adaptation and task adaptation. In domain adaptation, we learn generalizable representations across domains and tasks. For instance, when transferring a model trained on images to medical imaging tasks like X-ray analysis, we may need to adjust the weights of some of the earlier layers according to their specialized function in recognizing patterns common to both visual and medical images.
    
    On the other hand, task adaptation focuses on adapting a pre-trained model to perform a specific task better than its original purpose. This approach involves using pre-trained weights as well as retraining the last few layers on our target task. 

3. Finetuning vs. Sensitive Training
   The third distinction between transfer learning techniques is between finetuning and sensitive training. Finetuning refers to loading an existing pre-trained model and continuing the training process on additional unlabelled data. Sensitive training takes place when we train the entire network from scratch without any prior knowledge of the problem being solved. While finetuning provides good initial results quickly, it also introduces a risk of overfitting and loses the opportunity to leverage previous knowledge and experience. 

In summary, there are three main steps involved in applying transfer learning:

1. Selecting a pre-trained model: choose a pre-trained model architecture such as VGG, ResNet, or MobileNet and download the corresponding weight parameters file(s).
    
2. Fine-tune the pre-trained model: remove the final layer(s) of the model and adjust the remaining layers so they fit the target task (in this case, X-ray diagnosis). During this step, we typically use cross-entropy loss and stochastic gradient descent optimization. 
    
3. Evaluate the fine-tuned model: test the fine-tuned model on held-out validation set to see how well it performs on the target task. If necessary, tweak hyperparameters to further improve performance.
    
Overall, transfer learning offers numerous advantages including faster training times, reduced computational resources required, improved accuracy, and potential for greater flexibility in the choice of architecture design and training strategy.
