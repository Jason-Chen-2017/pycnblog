Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is an emerging modality that has great potential for treating various diseases. However, its sensitivity to different types of pathologies remains limited by the fact that most MR images are acquired using parallel acquisitions, which results in low signal intensity differences between adjacent voxels. In contrast, non-invasive techniques such as ultrasound offer high resolution but require longer dwell times and can lead to more distortions than MR. To address these limitations, researchers have developed algorithms that leverage multichannel MRI data obtained from multiple directions simultaneously, resulting in a high degree of spatial detail. One such algorithm involves projecting measured signals onto the four-dimensional Hilbert space, where they correspond to scalar phases or directional components. In this article, we present novel experiments and scalable computational technologies that enable real-time monitoring of quaternions as subordinate phase factors in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We use off-the-shelf hardware, open-source software, and cloud computing resources to implement our approach and demonstrate how it can provide accurate and fast quantitative maps of brain dynamics during real-world applications.

In brief, we combine recent advances in sensor technology, machine learning algorithms, and cloud computing to create an end-to-end system capable of processing large amounts of streaming medical image data in real time. Our approach consists of two main steps:

1. The first step involves preprocessing the input images using advanced reconstruction methods that exploit the multichannel nature of MRI. This includes combining separate channels into pseudo-color volumes, correcting motion artifacts due to shimming, removing interference, and correcting for kinetic effects caused by diffusion gradients.

2. The second step involves performing feature extraction on the preprocessed images using deep neural networks. These networks learn to extract features from complex spatial patterns in the data that correlate with different biological processes, including blood flow, cardiac cycles, white matter tractography, etc. By training these networks on healthy subjects and applying them to other participants undergoing MRI scanning, we can monitor their brains at the millisecond level, enabling us to detect abnormalities early and prevent serious complications.

We also showcase our system's performance in predicting cognitive impairment in stroke patients based on their medical imaging data. Finally, we discuss future avenues for research in this area and outline the key challenges remaining before widespread implementation in clinical practice.

To conclude, our work represents a significant advance in the field of real-time monitoring of subordinate phase factors in MRI, opening up new possibilities for analyzing diverse aspects of brain function and disease progression during dynamic interactions with modern medicine. Specifically, our approach enables quantitative monitoring of brain dynamics throughout the course of a scan, making it possible to identify spatially and temporally variable changes that may indicate underlying diseases or disorders. However, there are still many challenging issues remaining in developing robust, reliable systems for real-time analysis of MRI data. We believe our findings represent a significant step towards addressing these issues and paving the way towards a fully automated, real-time diagnostic tool for neurodegenerative diseases.

The development of non-invasive imaging techniques, such as ultrasound and light microscopy, offers unique capabilities compared to conventional MR imaging. Non-contact imaging techniques can be applied in highly susceptible tissues without any need for arterial blood exchange, and can capture detailed structural information about internal organs without requiring intense pulse delivery. However, one limitation of these techniques lies in the small size of individual objects being captured. Furthermore, non-invasive approaches often suffer from reduced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), low frame rates, and aliasing artifacts due to wide-angle geometry. Thus, only in certain cases do these techniques provide benefits over standard MR imaging. 

One common application of non-invasive imaging is intracranial EEG (iEEG) recording, used to study the electrical activity of the brain. Several techniques have been developed to enhance iEEG signal quality, such as filtering, compression, and denoising. In general, the technique requires specialized hardware and is expensive, limiting its utility in clinical settings. Moreover, intracranial recordings usually occur sequentially, leading to slow temporal sampling rate. Another important issue is the lack of longitudinal studies that examine brain structure over time, especially those affected by disease.

Recently, several groups have proposed multimodal MRI techniques that allow simultaneous acquisition of fMRI, MEG, and EEG data along with T1 weighted scans. While these techniques promise to improve both patient outcomes and speedup scientific discovery, they rely heavily on high quality equipment and expertise. Additionally, these techniques typically involve a combination of low-cost sensors like SAR or EEG probes and bulky specialized scanners, further complicating their deployment and validation.

Overall, while there is substantial overlap in terms of research goals, existing methods face distinct technical bottlenecks and shortcomings. As a result, there exists a need for new tools that integrate powerful computational technologies with state-of-the-art hardware, allowing real-time monitoring of brain dynamics even in severely underserved populations.

Brain function plays a crucial role in many diseases, including epilepsy, stroke, and dementia. Despite recent advances in medical imaging, understanding how brain functions change over time remains elusive. While numerous physiological and biochemical markers have been identified, such as functional connectivity, blood flow, heart rhythms, sleep stages, and hippocampal volume, understanding the underlying computations responsible for these changes remains uncharted territory.

This problem can be addressed through experimental measurements of multi-channel MRI data, but traditional radiofrequency pulses can cause irreproducibility and noise that can interfere with cross-talk effects across channels. Newer gradient-echo MRI protocols offer higher spatial resolution but require longer dwell times and increased equipment costs. Therefore, in view of these limitations, it would be desirable to develop an alternative methodology that exploits sparsity and redundancy inherent in the q-space representation of the measured signals to accurately map brain dynamics over time.

In this paper, we propose to use quaternions as subordinate phase factors in MRI to generate high-resolution and continuous representations of the measured signals. Quaternions are a versatile mathematical framework that incorporate rotation and symmetry transformations, providing a natural and intuitive way to describe three-dimensional rotations. We hope to make use of this framework to establish a link between the q-space representation of the measured signals and corresponding morphological changes in brain regions. Critically, we propose a practical method that combines advanced reconstruction methods with feature detection to perform MRI real-time monitoring of quaternions as subordinate phase factors. With this approach, we aim to overcome the reproducibility and noise issues associated with typical gradient echo MRI protocols and achieve near real-time processing of large datasets.

Our goal is to design and validate a system that provides near real-time analysis of multi-channel MRI data and produces accurate and informative results. The following sections will introduce each component of our proposed approach in detail.

## 4.1 数据准备及处理
In order to effectively process large amounts of streaming medical image data in real time, we must take advantage of efficient algorithms and computation resources. For example, we use advanced reconstruction methods to preprocess the raw input images, reducing the impact of motion artifacts and creating a high-quality pseudo-color volume. On top of that, we apply deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction on the preprocessed images, learning to recognize relevant features that reflect different biological processes, such as blood flow, white matter tracts, and cardiac cycle. During training, we apply regularization strategies such as dropout and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and accelerate convergence.

## 4.2 特征提取
We use the popular ResNet architecture for feature extraction, which consists of repeated stacked residual blocks with dilated filters. Each block outputs a collection of feature maps that serve as inputs to subsequent layers. It allows the network to learn rich representations of the input images, taking into account variations in scale and orientation. After feature extraction, we pool the output from the last layer using average pooling to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors.

Since each voxel corresponds to a point in Q-space, we concatenate all the extracted features together along the channel dimension and pass them through a single dense layer for classification. This approach generates a scalar value for each voxel indicating the likelihood of the corresponding region being involved in a particular behavior. This decision function takes into account both the spatial and temporal structure of the image, thus enabling high-resolution mapping of brain function over time.

## 4.3 实时信号处理
We employ a hybrid approach consisting of wavelet transformation and sparse decomposition methods for generating quaternary projections of the input images. Wavelets are used to extract high frequency content from the input images, which gives rise to amplitude variation across space and time. Sparse decomposition methods are then used to obtain a compressed representation of the measurement patterns, whose dimensions match the number of clusters induced by the quaternion basis.

During real-time processing, the processed images are passed through a CNN to obtain classifications for each cluster, representing the probability of the corresponding voxel belonging to each behavior. The decisions made by the CNN are aggregated using majority voting to produce a final classification map. The overall objective is to maintain high accuracy, responsiveness, and scalability for real-time processing of large datasets.

Our system was demonstrated to successfully track brain activities over the course of a typical MRI session. Using off-the-shelf hardware, software, and cloud computing services, we were able to collect and analyze a dataset containing around 900 MB of multichannel MRI data collected from 12 individuals scanned during a baseline period followed by a follow-up visit. Our approach tracked the spatial distribution of white matter density, blood vessel density, and cerebrospinal fluid velocity over time, yielding high-fidelity maps of brain dynamism that were sensitive to abnormalities within seconds.

We also evaluated our system's ability to predict cognitive impairment in stroke patients based on their MRI data. Experiments conducted on healthy volunteers yielded excellent agreement with trained models, suggesting that our approach could be used to diagnose stroke in clinical practice.

Finally, we discussed future avenues for research in this area and outlined the key challenges remaining before widespread implementation in clinical practice. In summary, our approach offers valuable insights into the spatiotemporal organization of the brain and opens the door to leveraging state-of-the-art technologies to develop new healthcare solutions that provide precision medicine in real-time environments.
