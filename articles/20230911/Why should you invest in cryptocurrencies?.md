In this article we will explain why investing in cryptocurrencies is one of the most attractive financial instruments available today and provide an overview of how it works. Cryptocurrencies are digital tokens that can be exchanged for fiat currencies or other cryptocurrencies through a decentralized network without any intermediary like banks or brokers. They are quickly becoming a popular investment option due to their low cost, security, stability and accessibility compared to traditional stocks and bonds. This article aims to help readers understand the benefits of investing in cryptocurrencies, its market trends, trading techniques and limitations. We will also explore the risks associated with cryptocurrency investments and suggest ways to mitigate these risks while staying on top of the ever-evolving markets. Finally, we will demonstrate various methods by which individuals and institutions can start investing in crypto assets.

This article assumes the reader has basic knowledge about finance concepts such as risk management, fundamental analysis and trading techniques.

# 2.Basic Concepts
Cryptocurrencies are virtual assets created on blockchains that exist only within the blockchain system and cannot be transferred outside the system. These tokens have intrinsic value because they can be used to trade on the exchange platforms like Binance, Coinbase, Kraken etc., just like regular stocks and bonds. Each token is backed by real-world currency and all transactions are encrypted ensuring confidentiality and immutability. 

The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin (BTC) launched on March 9th, 2009. It has been regarded as the greatest milestone in the history of financial technology since its birth. The price of BTC reached $7,000 by January 2017 and has gained exponential growth over the last few years. Currently, there are around 37,000 different cryptocurrencies being traded on various exchanges worldwide. Some of the prominent ones include Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), Monero (XMR), Stellar Lumens (XLM), Tezos (XTZ) etc.

Most of the current mainstream altcoins are based on proof-of-work mining algorithm where users compete to solve complex mathematical problems called "hashing puzzles" to mine new blocks containing transaction records. Miners receive rewards for solving these puzzles and get rewarded more the longer they maintain a high hashing power. Although miners can earn significant amounts of income, they must keep their hash rate constant to ensure that their block creation is efficient and secure. To make up for lost profit, some coins like Bitcoin Cash (BCH) aim to create a faster alternative using scrypt algorithm instead of SHA-256. Other coins like Vertcoin (VTC), Pivx (PIVX), NEM (XEM) and many others use variations of POW algorithm to achieve higher difficulty levels.

To increase the number of participants in the consensus process, some coins like DogeCoin (DOGE), NANO (NANO), Zcash (ZEC) etc. launch side chains that allow smaller wallets to participate in the network and transact directly with each other. While side chain technology provides greater scalability than centralization, it comes with several drawbacks including trust issues, slow confirmation times and lack of privacy guarantees. With increasing popularity of decentralized finance protocols like Decentralized Finance (DeFi), cross-chain swaps, liquidity pools, NFTs and Gambling games, investors are turning towards more sophisticated models of managing portfolio risk.

Despite its growing importance, safekeeping of cryptocurrencies requires careful attention to the key security measures implemented to protect user funds. Risks such as hacking attacks, quantum computing attacks, accidental loss of private keys, manipulation of exchange rates, inflationary pressure from speculation activities, illicit activity involving high-risk exchanges or contracts, government interventions, insider threats and cybercrime pose serious challenges to the ecosystem. However, improvements in cryptocurrency technologies and institutional investor relationships can help address these concerns. Various organizations and companies have come together to develop mechanisms to address these risks and ensure that investors remain protected. Examples of such organizations include Proof of Work Foundation, LedgerSec, Blockchain Security Alliance, ConsenSys Diligence, Bizancio blockchain group and Counterparty XYZ. Overall, cryptocurrencies offer exciting opportunities for both individual investors and large-scale institutional investors alike who want to diversify their portfolios but also seek to manage risk better than ever before.
