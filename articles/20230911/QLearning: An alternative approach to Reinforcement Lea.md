# 1.简介
  

Q-Learning是一种强化学习方法，它利用贝尔曼方程和价值函数对环境状态进行建模，通过不断试错探索出最优的动作序列。Q-Learning相比传统的RL算法，其优点在于训练效率高、适用于连续动作空间、可扩展性强、可处理长期规划等。然而，Q-Learning还是存在一些局限性，如没有考虑到“未知的、不可预测的”环境变化、策略差异、多步决策等。因此，作者提出了一种新型的Q-Learning算法——软实值函数（Soft Value Function）。该算法的特色在于通过控制探索/利用比例，可以平衡各种策略之间的收敛效果。这项工作是对基于表格的方法的一种改进，并着重于解决上述三个问题，即“未知的环境变化”、“多步决策”及“策略差异”。本文将对软实值函数的概念、基本算法、示例代码、应用实例和未来研究方向做详细阐述。

2.问题定义
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning that allows an agent to learn how to make decisions under uncertain and complex environments by interacting with the environment and receiving feedback in form of rewards and penalties over time. The goal of RL is to maximize the long term reward by finding suitable actions in different situations according to the current understanding of the environment and policy. 

However, there are some challenges associated with traditional reinforcement learning algorithms such as “unknown future states”, “multi-step decision making”, and “policy difference”. To address these issues, authors have proposed soft value function algorithm called Q-learning which balances exploration/exploitation ratio while training agent. This paper discusses about this new approach towards solving three fundamental problems faced by existing RL methods – "Unknown Future States", "Multi-Step Decision Making" and "Policy Difference". Finally, we will provide examples of using Soft Value Functions for various tasks like gridworld navigation and robotics control.

## Soft Value Function Approach
The main idea behind soft value functions is to introduce two additional terms to the standard Bellman equation for optimal Q-values estimation. One term is known as the expected soft maximum, which represents the upper confidence bound on the action-value function. Another term is known as the temperature parameter, which controls the amount of randomness injected into the model during training. In practice, the temperature parameter can be adjusted gradually from a high initial value until it reaches a low final value, allowing the system to converge more smoothly to its most optimal solution.

In summary, the soft value function approach involves introducing two modifications to the standard Q-learning update rule:

1. Expected soft maximum (ESM): Instead of taking the argmax operator at each iteration, use the ESM to estimate the best possible state-action pair. The ESM gives a sort of upper confidence bound on the best action given any state, based on the estimated values of all possible next states.
2. Temperature Parameter: A temperature parameter determines the degree of exploration versus exploitation in the system. As the temperature increases, the agent becomes increasingly more likely to explore new states, but also less likely to exploit those it has already explored. During training, the temperature parameter should initially be set high enough to allow the agent to explore different paths, but then decreased down to zero or even negative values to limit the exploration.

## Q-Values
A Q-value is defined as the total discounted future reward obtained from taking a specific action in a particular state, assuming that all other possible actions are evaluated equally well. The discount factor $\gamma$ specifies how much importance is assigned to future rewards. At each step in an episode, the agent receives a scalar reward $r_t$, where $t$ denotes the timestep. Assuming a finite number of steps ($T$) within an episode, the cumulative discounted return is computed as follows: 

$$G_t = r_t + \gamma R_{t+1} + \gamma^2 R_{t+2} +... + \gamma^{T-t-1}R_{T}$$ 

where $R_t$ refers to the reward received after the $t$-th step. The discounted cumulative return gives us an approximation of the true sum of rewards we would receive if we were to follow a greedy strategy throughout the entire episode without considering future events beyond the $T$-th step. However, since we don't know what the future events are, we cannot compute the exact Q-values for all actions in every state. Instead, we need to use our knowledge of the dynamics of the environment to approximate them.
