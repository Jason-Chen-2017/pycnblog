Sustainability monitoring involves tracking key environmental factors such as air pollution, water quality, soil condition, climate change, land use and biodiversity conservation. To effectively manage these environmental aspects, accurate data collection from various sensors are required. However, manual data acquisition can be time-consuming and error-prone. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight approach for sustainability monitoring by using deep learning (DL) algorithms to automatically detect abnormal sensor readings and forecast future trends. We have developed a DL model that takes multi-sensor input data along with temporal features and outputs anomaly detection scores and predicted values. Our proposed solution has several advantages: it leverages existing sensor networks while reducing costs; it uses DNN architectures with reduced complexity compared to traditional machine learning models; it can handle large volumes of data and enable real-time processing; and it does not require any specialized knowledge or expertise in sustainability monitoring.
In this article, we will discuss the detailed design and implementation of our lightweight system architecture that utilizes DNNs for sustainability monitoring. We will also provide examples of how to integrate the framework with other systems components like databases, visualization tools, etc., enabling efficient and reliable management of sustainability data. Finally, we will highlight some limitations and challenges associated with the proposed approach. Overall, our goal is to present a practical and user-friendly framework for rapidly collecting and analyzing sustainability data using state-of-the-art DNN techniques.

Sustainability monitoring is essential for effective management of natural resources, but manual data collection is expensive and error-prone. Therefore, there is a need to develop a novel sustainability monitoring system architecture that leverages DL technologies for automatic anomaly detection and prediction. In this paper, we propose a lightweight system architecture for sustainability monitoring that integrates multiple sensor data sources and works in real-time to enhance data accuracy and efficiency. We describe the basic principles of our approach, including the ML pipeline, feature engineering, anomaly detection methodology, and data visualization tools. We showcase our results through example applications demonstrating its effectiveness at detecting anomalies and predicting future trends in sustainability data. Additionally, we analyze possible limits and benefits of our framework against current approaches. By comparing different sustainability monitoring systems, we hope to demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our approach in achieving high levels of accuracy and reliability in identifying sustainable practices.

We begin by providing a brief background on sustainability monitoring and explaining the motivation behind developing a new sustainability monitoring system architecture using DL techniques. We then define the technical terms involved and explain their importance in our work. Next, we introduce the concept of sustainability monitoring system architecture and illustrate each component within the architecture. We then move on to explain the functionalities of the system architecture, starting with the core ML pipeline followed by the preprocessing steps necessary before feeding them to the trained neural network. Afterward, we discuss the methods for anomaly detection and explore how they apply to both real-time and historical data. Finally, we showcase the results obtained by applying our framework to a case study involving satellite imagery collected over different regions of the world.
