Open source software (OSS) has been a staple of modern technology for decades and is poised to become the mainstream in years to come. It allows developers to create, modify, distribute and collaborate on code that is easily accessible and useful to other users. However, open-source projects also face challenges such as technical debt accumulation and lack of maintenance due to various reasons. 

It's no secret that programmers are some of the most dedicated contributors to OSS. A study by GitHub found that only half of all new contributors are from programmers, while nearly three quarters contribute solely through documentation or issue triaging alone. There are several reasons why programmers contribute to OSS: 

1. Programming skills - Developers can help with critical bug fixes, enhancements and add features that they feel will make their product better. They may also improve existing functionalities, documentation or provide tutorials for beginners who want to learn how to use the library.

2. Problem-solving - Programmers often have a creative approach towards solving problems which helps them come up with unique solutions and deliver high-quality products faster than others. They can also identify potential bugs and edge cases during development and test early releases before committing to release candidate phases. 

3. Networking opportunities - By joining communities or working with organizations around the world, programmers get access to global expertise and knowledge that they otherwise would not be able to obtain elsewhere. This builds a stronger community support structure within an organization, and brings in more talented individuals with relevant skills and experience.

4. Team collaboration - Having multiple developers contributing to a single project encourages teamwork and leads to greater quality of work. The ability to quickly merge different changes into one codebase, streamline processes and resolve conflicts, fosters better communication across the team and boosts morale. 

5. Career growth - Within the larger developer community, programmers gain valuable career-related experiences, including internships, job offers and promotion. Additionally, many employers pay well compensated salaries to top programming talent, making it easier for them to attract skilled employees.

In this article, we'll explore these five reasons for programmers' contribution to OSS. We'll start with basic background information about what exactly "open source" means and how it works. Then, we'll dive deeper into each reason and talk about its impact and importance on the long run. Finally, we'll conclude by discussing the prospects and future directions for programmers' involvement in OSS.  

# 2.Background Information
## 2.1 What is Open Source?
Open source refers to any piece of software whose source code is publicly available under a free license allowing anyone to view, modify, and distribute it. Although there are varying definitions depending on the specific context, generally speaking, it includes anything related to computer programs where the source code is made freely available for everyone to see, copy, modify, and redistribute. The term itself was coined in 1998 by Linus Torvalds and serves as a way of protecting free speech. Some popular examples of open source projects include Linux, Apache, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Python, and Git. These projects enable people to build applications and software using pre-built functions without having to write everything themselves. 

To understand how open source works, let us consider a simple example - web browsers like Firefox and Chrome. Both of these browsers are built on top of an open-source framework called WebKit, which provides HTML parsing and rendering capabilities alongside numerous APIs for accessing system resources like file systems, network connections, databases etc. When you download either browser, you're actually getting the same source code as if you were compiling it yourself. You don't need special permissions or hardware to install them on your machine; simply extract the downloaded files and run them. In fact, when you check the version number of the browser, you might even find out that it came from an open source project!
