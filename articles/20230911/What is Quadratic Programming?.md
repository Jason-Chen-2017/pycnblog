## 1.什么是二次规划？
二次规划（Quadratic programming）是一种数学优化方法，它是对目标函数的某些变量进行限制，从而找到一个最优解。在很多工程问题中，均可以转化成二次规划的形式。

二次规划的目的是在给定目标函数F(x)及约束条件C(x)，通过改变目标函数或约束条件的取值，来求得使目标函数取得最小值的解。一般来说，目标函数有多种形式，如线性函数、二次函数等；约束条件往往由不等式和等式组成。若把目标函数F(x)和约束条件C(x)中的变量用向量表示，则优化问题可以表示为:

min F(x): x∈R^n 

s.t. C(x)=0, ∀x 

其中，x为n维向量，s为矩阵形式的约束条件，用(A_i, b_i)表示第i个约束条件。

二次规划与线性规划的不同之处主要有以下几点:

1.二次规划有着更强的全局优化能力，能够解决非凸问题。

2.对于一些复杂的约束问题，二次规划可以得到非常好的近似解，而线性规划通常会陷入无穷循环。

3.由于求解过程不依赖梯度下降等迭代算法，因此其计算速度比线性规划快很多。

4.虽然二次规划可以在无约束条件下求解，但是它的近似解可能不一定很好。

## 2.为什么需要二次规划？
二次规划的主要应用场景如下:

1.计算最大流问题：最大流问题可以看作是具有容量限制的网络流问题，可转化为二次规划的求解。

2.线性规划问题：线性规划问题是指在满足一定约束条件下的线性方程组的最小化问题。根据线性规划模型的特点，可以将其转换成具有不同优化目标的二次规划问题，从而求得全局最优解。

3.金融风险管理问题：对股票交易、债券交易等业务活动进行风险控制时，采用二次规划方法可以分析成本、收益、波动率等各个因素之间的关系，并确定最佳分配方案。

## 3.如何运用二次规划？
二次规划的求解过程分为两个阶段:
1.线性规划——寻找初始基准解
2.二次规划——进一步优化求解

首先，需要先建立线性规划模型，找出一组初始基准解。然后，利用一定的搜索策略（如线搜索法），逐步缩小范围，提升求解精度。最后，使用二次规inalg法求得全局最优解。

二次规划的求解方式主要有两种：
1.内点法（Interior point method）——基于Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) 不等式约束的算法
2.拟牛顿法（Quasi-Newton Method）——用于处理复杂非线性约束的算法

二次规loptimization的方法很多，但常用的有枝杈线搜索法（Sequential Least Squares Programming, SLSQP），拟牛顿法（BFGS， L-BFGS， GD，...）以及Interior Point方法（ interior-point methods）。下面我们重点介绍一下二次规划算法的基本原理。

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## 1.Optimization Problem Formulation
二次规划的目标是找到一个变量集合$X=(x_1,\cdots,x_n)$，其值满足下列最优化问题:

$$\text{min}_{X} \quad f(X) $$

subject to $g_i(X)\leq c_i,\ i=1,\ldots,m,$ and $h_j(X)=d_j,\ j=1,\ldots,p.$ where $\quad X=(x_1,\cdots,x_n),\quad g_i:\mathbb R^{n}\to \mathbb R, h_j:\mathbb R^{n}\to \mathbb R$ are affine constraints, respectively. The problem can be rewritten in the standard form:

$$\begin{aligned}
&\underset{X}{\text{min}} & &f(X)\\
&\text{s.t.} & &\begin{array}{c}
g_i(X) \\
h_j(X)=d_j\\
\end{array}\leq 0\quad \forall i,j.\\
\end{aligned}$$

The objective function $f$ should be quadratic or a semidefinite program (SDP). A quadratic function of $X$ is called a convex quadratic function; while a nonnegative semidefinite matrix $M$ represents an SDP that minimizes the trace of its smallest eigenvalue. In general, the optimization problems mentioned here may have any combination of these types of functions. We will see how they affect the algorithm later on.

We use $X$ to denote the decision variables and assume that we want to minimize a linear function $f$. If there are no nonlinear terms, then this can always be done using gradient descent algorithms such as steepest descent or conjugate gradient. However, if there are other terms besides the ones with respect to $X$, we need to consider more sophisticated methods. Some common choices for additional terms include additive noise (e.g., Gaussian process priors), additive linear terms (e.g., penalty functions or regularizers), or exponential terms (e.g., decaying penalties).

## 2.Constraints
There are several kinds of constraints used in quadratic programming:

1. Affine constraints: These are simply equality or inequality conditions that involve only the values of the decision variables $X$. We represent them by $g_i(X)\leq c_i,\ i=1,\ldots,m,$ and $h_j(X)=d_j,\ j=1,\ldots,p.$ For example, $g_{ik}(X)\leq c_{ik},\ k=1,\ldots,l$ could represent that a certain sum of the elements of two vectors cannot exceed some fixed value. 

2. Quadratic constraints: These impose additional restrictions on the values of the decision variables. They are expressed in the form $(Ax+b)^TQ(Ax+b)-q^TA^TX+\mu=0$, which means that for all possible values of $X$, at least one element must satisfy the condition $Ax+b=0$ with corresponding coefficients $a_i$ and constants $b$. We typically write these constraints as $(G_k,h_k)=(Q_k,q_k),\ k=1,\ldots,K,$ where each constraint has size $m_k\times n$ and represents a set of marginal constraints over subsets of the decision variables. Each row of $G_k$ specifies the lower bounds of the corresponding column of $X$, while each entry of $h_k$ corresponds to the upper bound for that variable. Note that since we are dealing with sets of marginal constraints, it's crucial to ensure that we're choosing appropriate thresholds when specifying our quadratic programs.

3. Second-order cone constraints: These allow us to enforce the second-order correlations among the decision variables. They take the form of positive definite matrices, so their representations don't look like those of the other constraints. Specifically, given a symmetric matrix $H\in\mathbb R^{n\times n}$, we can express it as a rank-one constraint in $\{X\}$ by setting $G=\begin{bmatrix}-H\\I_n\end{bmatrix}$ and $h=-z^\top H z/2$ where $z\in\{0,1\}^n$ indicates whether each element of $X$ is zero or nonzero. This constraint constrains the square root of the matrix $H$ to be nonnegative along each vector $[v]$ spanned by the other components of $X$.

4. Exponential cone constraints: These allow us to define arbitrary power laws within the decision space. They come in three forms: quadratic terms, exponential terms, and logarithmic terms. Given a real number $\alpha>0$ and a symmetric matrix $M\in\mathbb R^{n\times n}$, we can specify a scalar product term of the form $\sum_{i<j} w_iw_j\exp((-\frac{\|v_i-v_j\|_2^2}{2\beta})^{\alpha/2}),\ v_i\in\mathbb R^n,\ w_i\in\{-1,1\}.$ We interpret $w_i$ as binary variables indicating whether the $i$-th element belongs to the left or right tail of the distribution. This representation allows us to express complex relationships between different parts of the decision space without introducing explicit dependencies. 

5. Nonlinear constraints: Finally, we also deal with general nonlinear constraints. One approach is to approximate them using low-degree polynomial approximations. Another option is to use mixed integer nonlinear programming techniques to optimize over high-dimensional spaces. Both approaches require careful consideration of numerical issues and potential instability due to ill-posedness.


## 3.Solutions Methods 
There are various solutions methods available in quadratic programming:

1. Gradient Descent: Gradient descent is commonly used to solve many quadratic programming problems. It works by iteratively computing the direction of maximum increase in the objective function, and moving in that direction until convergence. There are several variations on this basic idea, such as Steepest Descent or Conjugate Gradients, which attempt to improve performance by exploring multiple directions simultaneously.

2. Active Set Methods: Active set methods attempt to identify which points are feasible during the search process and focus on optimizing over them. By doing so, they avoid unnecessary computations and reduce the chance of getting stuck in local minima. Common variants of active set methods include Barrier Method, Interior Point Methods, Augmented Lagrangian Method, and Coordinate Descent Method.

3. Mixed Integer Linear Programming: In most cases, we often face quadratic programming problems that do not admit efficient exact solution methods. To handle such problems, we can relax the problem into a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) instance, whose solution involves branch-and-bound methods. Common solvers for MILPs include CPLEX, GUROBI, and GLPK.

4. Semidefinite Programming: Similarly to linear programming, quadratic programming can be treated as a special case of semidefinite programming (SDP). Several recent papers show that convex quadratic programs can be solved efficiently using spectral methods such as Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and cutting planes. Moreover, extensions of KKT conditions exist for smooth nonconvex functions, including logistic regression and support vector machines.
