The popular Apache Hadoop framework provides an efficient and scalable platform for big data processing. In this article, we will explore the integration of the MySQL database into the Hadoop ecosystem using connectors such as JDBC or ODBC. We will also demonstrate how to use map-reduce programming model in Hadoop alongside SQL queries on the same dataset stored in a MySQL database. Finally, we will highlight several key benefits of using MySQL together with Hadoop including faster querying performance, high availability, and scalability.
本文将展示如何结合MySQL数据库与Hadoop生态系统中的连接器（如JDBC或ODBC）实现数据操纵。同时，也会演示如何在相同的数据集上采用Hadoop中的映射/归约编程模型进行SQL查询。最后，作者会着重介绍一下为什么要把MySQL与Hadoop结合起来，而它给人的最大优势就是更快、更可靠、更灵活地处理海量数据的能力。

## 1.背景介绍
Apache Hadoop is a distributed computing framework that enables large-scale data analysis across clusters of commodity servers. It has become one of the most widely used platforms for analyzing Big Data sets by providing effective methods for storing, processing, and analyzing datasets at scale. Despite its popularity, it lacked built-in support for relational databases. Therefore, it was necessary to integrate different tools and technologies to work seamlessly with various types of data sources. One example would be ingesting data from both structured (e.g., CSV files) and unstructured (e.g., text files) sources and performing complex queries over them. Another example could involve integrating machine learning algorithms and running predictive analytics on top of the processed data. 

While there are many ways to integrate with external systems, they can vary depending on the complexity and scale of your infrastructure. However, one common approach involves using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) or Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) drivers to connect to MySQL databases. These drivers enable you to access data stored in MySQL databases using standard SQL statements, making it easy to run SQL queries against them within the Hadoop environment. This allows you to leverage powerful SQL features like joins, aggregations, filtering, grouping, etc. which make working with large datasets much more intuitive than working with data in tabular format only.

However, while using purely SQL-based queries is convenient, building reliable, scalable applications requires advanced knowledge of distributed computing concepts such as parallelism, fault tolerance, consistency, and load balancing. The MapReduce programming model offers a simple yet powerful way to parallelize tasks and distribute data across multiple nodes in a cluster, which makes it ideal for processing large datasets. Combining these two approaches, combined with familiar SQL syntax, can help you build highly scalable, fault-tolerant applications that process massive amounts of data within minutes instead of hours or days.

In this article, we will go through several steps to perform basic operations on data stored in a MySQL database using the MapReduce programming model and the MySQL connectors:

1. Setting up the Environment - We will install and configure Hadoop and MySQL software on our local machine and create a test database.
2. Creating Input Files - We will write some sample input data files and upload them to HDFS for later consumption.
3. Configuring the Job - We will define the job configuration parameters such as mapper class, reducer class, and input file location.
4. Writing the Mapper Class - We will implement the logic required for each node to read and parse the input data file and emit output values based on the query requirements.
5. Writing the Reducer Class - We will implement the logic required for the master node to aggregate all the intermediate results produced by the mappers and generate final output.
6. Running the Job - Once everything is set up, we will submit the job to the Hadoop scheduler and monitor progress until it completes successfully.
7. Querying the Output - After the job finishes, we will retrieve the generated output files and analyze the results using SQL queries.

By following the above steps, we can efficiently ingest and transform data from various sources into a form suitable for further analysis and processing using Hadoop’s capabilities.
