# 1.简介
  

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of artificial intelligence that learns from experience to make decisions or take actions in an environment through trial-and-error process. In the context of game playing and robotics, RL has been applied for several decades as one of the most effective strategies to learn complex behaviors such as optimal policy or optimal control. 

In this article, we will introduce some basic concepts and terms related to reinforcement learning and applications in game playing and robotics. We will then explore the main algorithms including value iteration, Q-learning, policy gradient, DQN and Actor Critic methods in detail. Finally, we will discuss how these methods can be used to design robust and efficient games or agents that play against humans or other agents in realistic environments. 

This article assumes readers have a background in machine learning and optimization theory. If you are not familiar with them, please first read relevant literature before proceeding further. 

# 2.基本概念、术语和符号说明
## 2.1 马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）
The MDP (Markov Decision Process) is a widely used mathematical framework that defines the agent's interactions with its environment. It consists of three components:

1. Environment (S): The state of the world at each time step t. For example, in the case of a grid world, the state might include the position of the player and the position of all the walls. 

2. Action space (A): Actions that the agent can choose from at each time step. Examples could include moving north/south/east/west, picking up an item, throwing a ball etc.

3. Reward function R(s,a,s'): A reward signal given by the agent when it takes action a in state s and reaches state s'. This gives the agent feedback on its performance and encourages it to act optimally.

## 2.2 策略（Policy）
A policy is a mapping from state to action. When we say "agent follows policy π", it means the agent chooses actions based on the current state according to the probabilities assigned by the policy. For example, if π(go left) = 0.7 and π(go right) = 0.3, it means there is a 70% chance of the agent going left and a 30% chance of going right in each state. 

Policies can be deterministic or stochastic. Deterministic policies always return the same action given any state. On the other hand, stochastic policies return different actions based on their probabilities. Some examples of stochastic policies include epsilon greedy strategy and softmax policy.

## 2.3 Value Function （状态值函数 V(s)）
A state value function assigns a numerical value to each state s. The goal of an agent is to maximize the expected future rewards obtained while following the optimal policy. Formally, the value function is defined as:

$$V^\pi(s)=\mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi} [R(\tau)]$$

where θ represents the parameters of the policy π. The expectation symbol denotes the average over all possible trajectories that start in state s under policy π. 

Given a fixed policy, the state value function tells us what is the expected total discounted reward starting from state s. However, since the agent cannot directly observe the transition dynamics or next states, they must rely on estimated values of subsequent states to determine their actions. These estimated values come from the value functions. 

## 2.4 Bellman Equation （贝尔曼方程）
Bellman equation is a fundamental equation in dynamic programming. It specifies how to update the value function based on the new information received after taking an action in a particular state. Intuitively, it says that the value function should represent the expected long term reward if the agent keeps choosing the optimal action from that state. 

The general form of the Bellman equation is:

$$V^{\pi}(s)=\sum_{a \in A}\pi(a|s)\left[R(s,a)+\gamma\sum_{s' \in S}T(s,a,s')V^{\pi}(s')\right]$$

where T(s,a,s') is the probability of transitioning from state s to state s' via action a, gamma is the discount factor, and π is the current policy being followed. 

If the problem is episodic (i.e., only the end result matters), the discount factor γ can be set to 1. Otherwise, the higher the discount factor, the more importance is placed on future rewards relative to immediate ones. 

## 2.5 Q-Function （Q-函数）
Q-function provides a way to estimate the utility of taking certain actions in a particular state. Specifically, Q-value function assigns a numerical value to each pair of state-action $(s,a)$. Similarly to the value function, the goal is to find the optimal policy that maximizes the expected future rewards. 

Formally, the Q-value function is defined as:

$$Q^\pi(s,a)=\mathbb{E}_{s'}[\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\gamma^kR(s_k+1,...,s_K)]$$

where K is the horizon length. By contrast with the state value function, which estimates the expected future reward starting from state s, the Q-value function estimates the expected future reward starting from state s, taking action a. Unlike the value function, however, the Q-value function does not provide a direct measure of the quality of individual actions but rather reflects the entire decision making process.

To compute the Q-function efficiently, we use dynamic programming method called Q-learning. 

## 2.6 Policy Gradient （策略梯度法）
Policy gradient algorithm uses the idea of gradients to improve the policy during training. It treats the policy as a parameterized probability distribution, where the gradient is computed with respect to the policy parameters. The objective is to maximize the expected reward (over some episodes). 

Specifically, in policy gradient algorithm, we alternate between sampling a batch of transitions and updating the policy using the policy gradient. At each timestep, we sample a minibatch of N transitions from the replay buffer. The loss function is defined as:

$$\mathcal{L}(\theta)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{\tau \sim \mathcal{D}} \sum_{t=0}^{H-1} \mathcal{L}_t(\theta)$$

where $\mathcal{L}_t$ measures the difference between the actual and predicted log-probability of the action taken at time $t$. 

The key insight behind policy gradient is that the gradient of the surrogate loss w.r.t. the policy parameters leads to faster convergence than simple gradient descent methods, especially in high-dimensional spaces like deep neural networks. Instead of trying to optimize directly for the best reward function, we try to optimize for the best parameters of our policy so that we can generate better samples of experiences later on.

There are many variations of policy gradient algorithms, including REINFORCE, PPO, TRPO and AlphaGo Zero. All of them share the common feature of approximating the expectations over trajectories under the current policy using Monte Carlo estimation techniques. However, the details may differ depending on the specifics of the algorithm. 

## 2.7 Deep Q Network （DQN）
Deep Q Networks (DQNs) is a class of deep reinforcement learning models that uses a deep neural network to approximate the Q-function. It was originally proposed in 2013 by DeepMind researchers. DQNs use off-policy learning to improve the stability and sample efficiency of the updates. 

DQN separates the training into two stages. In the first stage, the agent interacts with the environment using its current policy, collecting data pairs consisting of state, action, reward, and next state. During the second stage, the agent constructs a large batch of randomly sampled tuples from the collected dataset, representing the trajectory of experiences. The network takes input features extracted from both the current state and the next state, concatenated together along the channel dimension. The output layer produces the predicted target Q-values corresponding to each action. The error between the predicted Q-values and the true labels is backpropagated to adjust the weights of the model towards the direction that minimizes the squared error. 

The DQN architecture typically involves multiple convolutional layers, fully connected layers and dropout regularization. Each tuple contains various types of observations such as pixel images, semantic maps, depth sensors, and GPS coordinates, making it flexible enough to handle various tasks. Additionally, due to the stochastic nature of the underlying Markov Decision Process, the exploration-exploitation tradeoff becomes important, requiring appropriate exploration strategies like random sampling and prioritized experience replay.
