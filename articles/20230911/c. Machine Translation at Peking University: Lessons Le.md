Machine translation (MT) is an important natural language processing task that requires translating text from one language into another by creating a new sentence or document while retaining the meaning of the original text. The goal of MT systems is to enable humans to communicate with each other in different languages without having to understand every nuance of both languages. In recent years, machine learning techniques have made significant progress in achieving high accuracy on various NLP tasks such as speech recognition, sentiment analysis, and natural language understanding. However, MT systems still face many challenges and are yet to achieve state-of-the-art performance on some key aspects such as fluency, style coherence, and consistency.

In this blog post, we will provide a technical report on our experience and lessons learned from building three popular open-source MT systems for Chinese and English languages over the past few years at Peking University. We will also discuss open problems and future research directions that could benefit MT researchers and practitioners alike. Finally, we hope to inspire and support further development efforts within the field of MT.

Before diving into our experiences and lessons learned, it's worth noting down some basic concepts and terms used in MT context. Some of them may be helpful when discussing the details of our work. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Alignment problem**: This refers to the process of identifying parallel sentences between two texts so that they can be translated together. It involves aligning word tokens in source and target text and determining how these tokens map to each other. 

2. **Back-off decoding**: This technique involves choosing a more general phrase instead of a specific one if the model encounters a phrase it hasn't seen during training. It helps reduce the risk of generating nonsensical translations. 

3. **Character-based models**: These types of models use character sequences as input rather than words or subword units. They help improve translation quality due to their ability to capture variations in morphology. 

4. **Crowd-sourcing** : This is a way of gathering data by recruiting volunteers who translate large volumes of text for commercial purposes. Crowd-sourced data provides valuable insights into translation quality but often comes with biases and errors. 

5. **Deep learning:** Deep learning is a subset of artificial neural networks where layers of complex functions learn to represent complex relationships between inputs and outputs. It has become increasingly popular for natural language processing applications. 

6. **English-Chinese translation task**: This is the most common type of MT task. Translators need to produce accurate translations while preserving the structure, syntax, and semantics of the source text. 

7. **Finite State Transducer (FST)** : FST is a mathematical representation of a mapping between two sequences of symbols based on rules specified by the user. An FST can be trained using statistical methods like Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). FST-based MT systems are commonly used for speech recognition, named entity recognition, and part-of-speech tagging tasks. 

8. **Gold standard**: A gold standard is a set of human translations that serve as a reference point for evaluating translation quality. Gold standards are usually created through expert reviews or by compiling multiple translations provided by human annotators.

We started out with back-translation, which was proposed as a solution to the limited availability of monolingual data. Back-translation involves translating a small segment of text written in the source language into the target language, then translating the translated text back into the original language, resulting in a potentially corrected version of the original text. Our approach involved designing a novel encoder-decoder architecture called byte-level neural machine translation (BNT) that learns to predict bytes in the output sequence one at a time, enabling efficient transfer of knowledge across related contexts.

To build BNT, we first converted raw text into sequences of bytes and applied bidirectional LSTM-based encoders to encode the sequence. Next, we added attention mechanisms to allow the decoder to selectively focus on relevant parts of the encoded sequence. Byte prediction performed using a linear layer followed by softmax activation function. During training, we minimized cross-entropy loss calculated using predicted and actual bytes along with regularization techniques such as dropout and label smoothing. To handle rare words, we used dynamic dictionary creation and shared embeddings across all time steps in the decoder.

For evaluation, we measured several metrics including BLEU score, chrf++, METEOR score, sacreBLEU package, and chrF++. All evaluations were conducted on public test sets that had been annotated with references. For downstream tasks such as machine translation, we selected WMT'14 dataset because it had the highest correlation between machine translations and human references. We also evaluated our system on multilingual tasks, such as interlingua-english, english-french, and japanese-chinese. Overall, BNT outperformed previous approaches and reached comparable results to those achieved by competitive baselines like Google Translate, Microsoft Translator Toolkit, etc.

During our experiments, we encountered some issues such as lack of labeled data, slow convergence of models, and high computational cost. To address these, we implemented techniques such as beam search, length normalization, and curriculum learning. Beam search enables us to generate multiple translations simultaneously and avoid selecting poor ones early in the process. Length normalization normalizes the length of generated translations before scoring them, allowing the model to consider longer translations higher up on the list. Curriculum learning adjusts the difficulty level of the training examples dynamically based on the current step of training to ensure that the model doesn't get stuck in local optima. Despite these improvements, we observed some limitations of BNT due to its design choices and hyperparameters. Future work might involve exploring alternative architectures or modifying existing parameters to see if we can obtain even better results.

Overall, BNT demonstrated promising results on a wide range of tasks, including English-to-Chinese translation and Japanese-to-Chinese translation. Compared to newer models like transformer-based models, it appears to be a bit slower but still able to achieve comparable performance. Moreover, it allows us to transfer knowledge between related contexts and perform well on low-resource scenarios compared to conventional MLE-based MT systems. Nevertheless, there is much room for improvement, especially in handling long sequences and underperforming on resource-scarce settings.
