Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a popular technique used to translate text from one language into another using deep learning models. However, in many cases the NMT system cannot fully exploit the rich linguistic information across different languages due to the limitations of training data and model architecture. In this work, we present an approach called cross-lingual knowledge transfer that leverages prior translations between multiple languages as well as shared lexicons for improved performance on low-resource languages such as African languages. We demonstrate our approach on three datasets: Multilingual Parallel Corpus (MRPC), Afrikaans-English, and Bangla-Hindi. Our results show significant improvements over competitive baselines, including state-of-the-art transformer models trained on monolingual corpora only. Finally, we discuss how this technology can be leveraged further to improve cross-lingual transfer for other NLP tasks beyond MT. Overall, we believe this new direction has the potential to transform cross-lingual machine translation research towards more advanced techniques for robustness against the constraints imposed by limited data and resource availability. 

In summary, we propose an effective methodology to train multilingual neural machine translation systems by combining previous translations between pairs of languages as well as shared lexicons. This enables us to perform cross-lingual knowledge transfer even when only few parallel sentences are available or when there are no publicly available pre-trained models. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed technique improves upon existing methods significantly on low-resource settings and achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art baselines on multilingual benchmarks. The insights gained through our work can help advance the field towards multi-task NLP applications, where cross-lingual knowledge transfer plays an important role in bridging the gap between similar but distinct languages.

## 2.1 Neural Machine Translation(NMT)
NMT stands for Neural Machine Translation which is a type of natural language processing technique which uses Artificial Intelligence to translate human readable texts from one language to another without using traditional programming techniques like rules. It involves building a mathematical model based on deep learning algorithms known as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The input to the algorithm is sentence written in source language while output is the corresponding sentence in target language. 

The main aim behind using NMT is to simplify the process of translating words from one language to another and ease communication across the globe. It helps in making worldwide communication more efficient and easier than it was before. One key advantage of NMT is its ability to handle large volumes of unstructured data effectively since it uses neural networks to capture contextual meaning between words. Another advantage is its flexibility, enabling easy adaptation to diverse domains and scenarios with minimal retraining effort. Additionally, NMT uses high-quality datasets for training which ensures quality of translation at any time.

Therefore, NMT is considered to be a promising tool for natural language processing. It provides accuracy and scalability as its primary benefits. But, training NMT on massive amounts of data and developing complex architectures demand expertise and resources. Therefore, deployment of NMT in real-world applications still requires considerable attention to detail. To address these challenges, various frameworks have been developed to automate the process of training NMT models. These frameworks typically include libraries, tools, and APIs that allow developers to easily integrate NMT solutions into their own applications.

However, despite their effectiveness, NMT remains challenging to apply to all types of language pairs. For instance, some languages may not have enough parallel data available to train accurate NMT systems, or certain combinations of languages might require specialized handling depending on cultural differences or historical context. Moreover, while exploiting recent developments in NLP and deep learning, NMT systems remain prone to adverse effects such as bias, noise, and errors caused by incorrect assumptions about the underlying structure of language. Despite these drawbacks, NMT continues to serve as a valuable asset in modern NLP systems.
