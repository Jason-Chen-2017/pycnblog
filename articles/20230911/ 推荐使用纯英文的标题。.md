Introduction
　　Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a popular field of research and development over the past decade. AI algorithms are developing rapidly in recent years, and it is expected that more powerful machines will be developed based on its abilities. In this article, we focus on the core principles behind the artificial neural network (ANN). ANNs have become one of the most important building blocks for machine learning and deep learning systems. Therefore, understanding how these networks work underneath helps us to build better models and achieve advanced performance levels. We will discuss several key concepts such as input, hidden layers, output layer, activation function, backpropagation algorithm, gradient descent optimization method, dropout regularization technique, mini-batch training, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We will also present various code implementations using Python programming language along with explanations and illustration. Furthermore, we will cover some challenges and future directions of applying ANNs in real-world applications. Overall, our goal is to provide an overview of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), their working mechanism and architecture, and showcase possible ways to apply them in industry and research environments.<|im_sep|>

## Input Layer 
 The first step in any neural network is to process data inputs through the input layer. The input layer receives data from the external environment or user interaction, preprocesses it, transforms it into usable information, and then feeds it into the rest of the network's layers. It accepts data in varying formats, including images, texts, audio signals, etc., and processes each feature independently by transforming them into neurons and passing them forward to the next layer. The number of neurons in the input layer depends upon the size of the input data. For instance, if we receive a vector of 784 pixel values representing a grayscale image of 28 x 28 pixels, the number of neurons would be equal to 784. 
 
 ## Hidden Layers 
 After receiving input data, the neural network passes it through hidden layers where complex transformations take place. Each hidden layer consists of multiple interconnected neurons that process the data they receive from the previous layer. These neurons apply weights to individual features received from the previous layer, summing up the weighted results, and passing the result through an activation function to produce an output signal that serves as input for the subsequent layer. The number of neurons in the hidden layers can vary depending on the complexity of the problem being solved and the amount of training data available. A large number of hidden neurons can lead to sparsity in the learned representations, making it difficult for the model to generalize well to new instances. On the other hand, too few hidden neurons may not be able to capture enough meaningful relationships between input variables, leading to suboptimal performance.
 
## Output Layer
The final stage in the neural network is the output layer, which produces the predicted value(s) based on the processed input data. This layer typically contains a single neuron whose activation function predicts either a binary class label or a continuous variable based on the input data received from the last layer. Common examples include regression problems where we seek to estimate a scalar value given a set of input features, and classification problems where we aim to identify different classes or categories based on a set of input features. 

## Activation Function 
 An activation function is used at every node of the neural network to introduce non-linearity into the system. There are many types of activation functions that can be applied to nodes: sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, ReLU, LeakyReLU, elliott, softmax, linear rectifier, and threshold. The choice of activation function ultimately depends on the nature of the problem being addressed and the type of data being fed into the network. For example, for a binary classification task, we might use the sigmoid activation function, while for a multi-class classification task with sparse categorical crossentropy loss, we might choose the softmax activation function instead.
 
## Backpropagation Algorithm 
 During training, the network adjusts its parameters iteratively based on the error between the actual and predicted outputs calculated during the forward propagation phase. To perform this update, we use the backpropagation algorithm, which propagates the errors backward from the output layer to the input layer, adjusting the weights of each connection accordingly. The weight adjustment causes the neural network to shift towards increasingly accurate predictions based on the feedback provided by the errors. The backpropagation algorithm makes significant improvements to the accuracy of the trained model by taking into account the impact of small changes in weights on the overall cost function. By contrast, simple random search or grid search methods do not consider the effects of small weight updates, limiting their ability to find optimal solutions within practical time constraints.  
 
## Gradient Descent Optimization Method 
 Another way to update the weights of connections is via gradient descent, a popular optimization algorithm used in conjunction with backpropagation to minimize the error between the predicted and actual outputs. The idea is to calculate the gradient of the error with respect to each weight parameter, and then move in the direction of steepest descent down the slope until convergence occurs. One common variant of gradient descent involves momentum, which allows the optimizer to keep track of previous gradients and speed up convergence to the minimum point. In addition to updating the weights, gradient descent techniques also involve techniques such as batch normalization, which normalize the inputs to each layer before calculating the gradient, and dropout regularization, which randomly drops out a certain percentage of neurons during training to prevent overfitting.
