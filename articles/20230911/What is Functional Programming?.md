> Functional programming (FP) is a style of programmimg that emphasizes the use of functions as first-class citizens in software development and design. It differs from imperative or object-oriented programming by not requiring the programmer to change their way of thinking entirely when transitioning from one function to another. Instead, FP focuses on using pure functions that produce the same result for any given input and avoid changing state or mutable data structures. FP encourages building programs with immutable values and immutability being the default behavior. 

Functional programming has been gaining traction in recent years due to its simple, modular and composable nature. However, some developers have questioned whether it's useful beyond just a theoretical exercise and how effective it can be applied to real-world problems. That's where this article comes into play: we will explore functional programming concepts and algorithms at a deeper level and see how they work within different programming languages. We'll also talk about why FP may not be suitable for every problem and potential pitfalls encountered along the way. Finally, we'll look ahead to what's next in functional programming and what functional programming might bring us. This comprehensive review aims to provide readers with a well-rounded understanding of FP, so they can make informed decisions when working with various programming languages and projects.


Functional programming is often described as "the next big thing" in the world of programming. Its roots are in lambda calculus, which was developed during the 1930s but still heavily influences functional programming today. Over the past decade, new tools such as Clojure, Haskell, and Scala have made functional programming more accessible than ever before. With all these new options available, it becomes difficult to choose between them. In fact, many developers who want to get started with functional programming tend to gravitate towards Scala because of its excellent support for both JVM and native platforms, strong built-in libraries, and active community support. Despite all these benefits, there remains significant controversy around functional programming, especially among those who dislike the concept altogether. In this article, I'll attempt to demystify the mystery surrounding functional programming and show you why it's an essential tool for solving complex problems.



# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
## Abstraction
Abstraction refers to the process of hiding details of implementation and showing only necessary information to the user. By abstracting away complexity, we simplify our code and reduce redundancy. The goal of abstraction is to enable focus on the core aspects of the problem while ignoring irrelevant distractions. Abstraction provides a high level view of the system that makes it easier to understand.

In programming, abstractions take several forms, including functions, classes, modules, etc. A function is defined as a set of instructions that performs a specific task. Functions allow us to encapsulate logic into reusable blocks, making code more organized and maintainable. Classes represent objects and help organize related methods together. Modules group related functions and variables together into a single unit. These abstractions can be nested within each other to create higher-level abstractions. For example, a module can contain multiple classes that define different types of widgets.

However, abstraction doesn't always mean complete removal of detail. When creating abstractions, we usually need to trade off clarity versus simplicity. There are cases where adding unnecessary detail can actually increase readability and ease of maintenance. Furthermore, abstraction can sometimes mask critical details, leading to subtle bugs or errors that could be harder to track down.

## Immutability and Pure Functions
Immutability means that once an object is created, its value cannot be changed. Immutable objects are convenient because they guarantee that the state won't change unexpectedly, allowing us to rely on their properties without worrying about side effects caused by mutation. They're also easy to reason about since their properties cannot be changed accidentally. While mutable objects require extra care, they offer greater flexibility and power.

Pure functions don't depend on any external state, meaning they return the same output given the same inputs. As long as the same parameters are passed in, they should produce the same results. Because they're deterministic, pure functions make it easier to test and debug code. Additionally, pure functions are easier to parallelize, enabling faster execution times across multiple processors or threads. Together, immutability and pure functions give rise to the paradigm of functional programming.

One common mistake people make when learning functional programming is applying mutable techniques to immutable objects. While it's technically possible to implement a mutable class based on an immutable base class, it's generally considered bad practice. Failing to follow this rule can lead to confusion and hard-to-debug issues. Similarly, it's recommended to treat non-pure functions like impure operations that modify state, even if they seem like pure functions.
