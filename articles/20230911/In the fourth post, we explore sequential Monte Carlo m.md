## Sequential Monte Carlo Methods(SMC)
Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods are a family of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms that can handle high-dimensional state spaces, uncertainty propagation, and non-Gaussian likelihoods. They have been applied successfully to various problems in robotics, computer vision, bioinformatics, finance, and social science. SMC offers several advantages compared with traditional MCMC algorithms:
- Higher accuracy due to using importance sampling
- Handling of uncertainties in models by allowing for arbitrary joint distributions between variables
- Robustness to non-identifiability by employing resampling techniques such as particle filtering and strategic resampling
- Flexibility to model nonlinearities and dependencies among variables via stochastic differential equations (SDEs).

The core idea behind an SMC algorithm is to simulate a series of Markov chains that start at different initial conditions but converge towards a common stationary distribution, similar to Metropolis-Hastings sampler. However, unlike typical MCMC algorithms that only produce one sample per iteration, SMC generates multiple samples from each Markov chain during each iteration. This allows us to estimate statistics of interest, including their variance and confidence intervals, while controlling error due to random fluctuations in the system. 

SMC has also been used for inference in Bayesian networks, decision trees, graphical models, latent variable models, and other applications requiring approximate inference over complicated distributions. The most commonly used variants of SMC include Particle Gibbs (PG) and Path Integral Resampling (PIR), which generate samples efficiently by simulating parallel particles in each Markov chain instead of separate chains. Other variants include Particle Filter (PF), Stratified Sampling (SS), and Weighted Importance Sampling (WIS).

## Probabilistic Programming Languages and Frameworks
Probabilistic programming languages and frameworks are tools that enable programmers to concisely specify statistical models in terms of mathematical formulas rather than in low-level programming languages like C++. These provide a higher level of abstraction than traditional object-oriented programming languages, resulting in code that is more readable, reusable, and easier to maintain. Popular probabilistic programming languages and frameworks include Stan, PyMC3, TFP, PyTorch, and Tensorflow. Some of these frameworks allow users to automatically derive gradients and Hessians for their specified models, enabling faster training and optimization of neural networks and other parameterized models.

The main components of a probabilistic program include data specification, model definition, and inference algorithms. Data specifications typically involve loading data into memory, specifying any preprocessing steps needed, and organizing it into input variables and observations. Model definitions describe how the system's state evolves over time given inputs, along with the assumptions about the prior distributions of the parameters. Inference algorithms take this model and data as input and output estimates of the posterior distributions of the parameters.

For example, let's consider a simple Gaussian linear regression problem:

1. We assume that there are two input variables $x_1$ and $x_2$, and an output variable $y$.
2. We observe a set of pairs $(x_i, y_i)$, where $i=1,\ldots,n$.
3. We want to infer the parameters $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$, assuming zero mean Gaussians for both inputs and outputs.

We can define our probabilistic program as follows in Stan:

```python
data {
  int<lower=0> n; // number of observations
  vector[n] x1; // first input variable
  vector[n] x2; // second input variable
  real y[n]; // output variable
}
parameters {
  real beta1; // intercept coefficient
  real beta2; // slope coefficient
  real<lower=0> tau; // precision of the noise term
}
model {
  target += normal_lpdf(beta1 | 0, tau); // prior on intercept
  target += normal_lpdf(beta2 | 0, tau); // prior on slope
  target += normal_lpdf(tau | 0.1, 0.01); // prior on precision

  for (i in 1:n)
    target += normal_lpdf(y[i] | beta1 + beta2 * x1[i], tau); // likelihood
}
generated quantities {
  real mu = beta1 + beta2 * x1; // predicted value of Y
}
```

This specifies that we have three data sources: `n` (the number of observations), `x1`, `x2`, and `y`. There are two unknown parameters (`beta1` and `beta2`) and one hyperparameter (`tau`), all assumed to be drawn from Normal distributions with standard deviations of `0.1` and `0.01` respectively. Finally, we specify a likelihood function for each observation based on the values of `beta1`, `beta2`, and `tau`.

Once we have defined the probabilistic program, we can run inference using the appropriate inference method provided by the probabilistic programming framework. For example, if we choose PyMC3 as our probabilistic programming language and select NUTS as our inference algorithm, we can run the following command:

```python
import pymc3 as pm
with pm.Model() as model:
  # Define priors for each parameter
  beta1 = pm.Normal('beta1', 0., sd=1.)
  beta2 = pm.Normal('beta2', 0., sd=1.)
  tau = pm.HalfCauchy('tau', 5.)
  
  # Specify likelihood
  obs = pm.Normal('obs',
                   mu=beta1 + beta2*data['x1'], 
                   sd=pm.math.sqrt(tau), 
                   observed=data['y'])
    
  # Run inference
  trace = pm.sample(tune=1000, draws=1000, cores=2)
  
print(trace['beta1'].mean(), trace['beta2'].mean())
```

This will perform inference using NUTS with 1,000 tuning iterations and 1,000 actual draws, using two CPU cores. It will print out the estimated values of `beta1` and `beta2`, which should be close to the true underlying coefficients. Note that we don't need to manually calculate derivatives or compute log probabilities since the probabilistic programming libraries already do this for us.
