# 1.简介
  

Nano-scale materials are the foundation of next generation electronic devices and it is critical to design efficient, robust, and cost-effective solutions for them. However, despite their importance, there has been relatively little research on developing high-throughput tools for fabricating such nanomaterials as they require specialised skills in optics and microstructure engineering. To overcome this limitation, we present a multiscale modeling approach that incorporates macroscopic (nanoscale) physics with mesoscopic (microscale) simulations using data-driven machine learning techniques. We demonstrate our methodology by applying it to studying the optical properties of SiC nanostructures at different thicknesses and shapes using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The results show that our model accurately predicts the multi-dimensional optical properties of nano-SiC structures, including absorption, extinction, scattering, and refraction spectra, even under varying illumination conditions and temperature gradients. Overall, our work demonstrates that multimodal data can be used effectively for parameterization and exploration of complex nanostructures without compromising resolution or accuracy. By combining multiscale modeling with data-driven methods, we hope to develop scalable and efficient tools for optimizing the fabrication of nano-scale materials with enhanced performance, reliability, and economic benefits. 
# 2.论文核心概念及术语说明
In this section, we briefly introduce some key concepts and terminologies that will be used throughout the paper. These include:
1. Macroscopic physics: This refers to physical phenomena occurring at smaller length scales than those studied in classical solid state physics, e.g., pressure, diffusion, viscosity, etc. It includes basic mechanics (e.g., Newton's laws), elasticity, viscosity, thermal conductivity, heat capacity, surface tension, adhesion/repulsion forces, electrical transport, etc. 

2. Mesoscopic simulation: This is a computational technique for simulating complex systems at sub-nanometer scales, which requires careful consideration of microscopic details like geometrical features, deformations, interactions between particles, chemical processes, etc. Typically, these simulations involve numerically solving partial differential equations (PDEs).

3. Data-driven machine learning (DDML): DDML involves training machines to learn from large datasets of input-output examples. DNN (deep neural networks), GAN (generative adversarial networks), etc. are popular types of DDML models.

We use CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulations to generate macro-scale field data for analyzing the nano-SiC physical properties, especially its optical properties. 

Mesoscale modeling is crucial for understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying the functional properties of nanoscale objects, and multiscale modeling allows us to take advantage of both macroscopic and microscopic information together. Furthermore, data-driven machine learning algorithms can automate the process of feature extraction, validation, and interpretation, making it easier to identify and understand the relationships among different physical variables within and across different scales.

## 3.1 模型介绍
We propose an automated multiscale CFD-based optimization framework for nano-SiC structure design based on data-driven machine learning algorithm. Our model takes into account two levels of complexity in the material; namely macroscopic (i.e., nanoscale) and meso-scale (i.e., microscale) physics. At the macroscopic level, we apply multiscale modeling approaches, specifically using non-conservative particle methods, to simulate the nanoscale behavior of nano-SiC samples. At the microscopic level, we perform hybrid finite element / particle simulation using cloud-based parallel computing infrastructure, where the flow field and particle positions are updated in real-time during the simulation. We further employ a data-driven approach through artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted feature extraction, classification, and regression techniques to optimize the microstructural parameters of the nano-SiC sample towards user-defined target values.

The following figure shows the overall architecture of the proposed model.



## 3.2 数据集
To train our AI-assisted system, we collected a dataset consisting of horizontally stacked nano-SiC samples, each having a unique shape and thickness distribution. Each image corresponds to a set of labeled attributes describing various aspects of the nanoscale material, such as porosity, roughness, size, Young’s modulus, and stiffness tensor elements. For example, images corresponding to bulk samples would have higher porosity, lower roughness, larger dimensions, lower Young’s modulus, and stronger stiffness tensors compared to thin film samples. Since the labels are derived directly from measurements made on the samples, our dataset enables us to evaluate how well our model performs given only measured inputs. Additionally, we also annotated additional information about each sample, such as the location and orientation of defects and substrate interfaces, for improved label quality and interpretability. 

## 3.3 模型结构
Our model consists of three main components:
1. Feature Extraction Module: This module extracts relevant features from the raw image data captured via CFD simulations. We achieve this by implementing convolutional neural networks (CNN) and pre-trained deep neural network architectures trained on ImageNet or other large-scale datasets. The output features are fed to the classifier component of the model.
2. Classifier Component: This module uses the extracted features to classify the microstructural characteristics of the nano-SiC samples according to the desired target labels. We experiment with several classification techniques, such as support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and decision trees. SVM and KNN perform best when the number of features is low, while decision trees work well for high-dimensional data. 
3. Parameter Optimization Module: Once the target label is predicted, the optimized parameters can then be obtained by adjusting the original microstructure configuration. This module considers the constraints imposed by the material property laws and calculates the objective function value, i.e., the distance between predicted and actual values for all required parameters. Here, we use gradient descent algorithm to update the parameters iteratively until convergence. After the optimal parameters are obtained, the finalized microstructure can be simulated again using CFD simulations to verify the performance of the designed structure against desired targets.  

### 3.3.1 CNN for Feature Extraction
We implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction from raw image data acquired during CFD simulations. Specifically, we use ResNet50 architecture, which is known to capture visual patterns effectively. Pre-training was performed on ImageNet dataset, which contains over one million images belonging to more than 22,000 categories. Fine-tuning was carried out on a small subset of the available data, which allowed us to adapt the model to our specific problem domain. The final layer of the model produces a feature map, which captures discriminative features relevant to the problem statement.

### 3.3.2 Support Vector Machines (SVM) for Classification
Support Vector Machines (SVM) are powerful classification techniques suitable for handling high-dimensional data. They offer better generalization capabilities compared to simpler models like logistic regression, KNN, and decision trees. We use an SVM classifier for binary classification problems, since our dataset contains many zero-valued entries due to missing measurements. The choice of kernel function also plays a significant role in determining the degree of sparsity in the resulting feature space, which affects the effectiveness of the learned weights.

### 3.3.3 Gradient Descent Algorithm for Parameter Optimization
Once the microstructural characteristics are successfully classified, we need to find the most optimal solution to meet certain specifications. One way to do this is to tune the microstructure parameters iteratively by updating the initial guess randomly until reaching a local minimum. Gradient descent algorithm offers a fast converging approach for finding the global minima of the objective function value. We choose a step size parameter to control the trade-off between speed and stability of convergence. We set the maximum iterations to prevent infinite looping scenarios. Finally, we compare the predicted and actual values of the target variable to measure the error rate and evaluate the model’s performance. If necessary, we repeat the above steps with different random starting points or modify the microstructure geometry to improve the prediction performance.
