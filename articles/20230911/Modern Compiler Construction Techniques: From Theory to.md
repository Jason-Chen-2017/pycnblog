# 1.简介
  

Modern compilers are one of the most critical software components that help software developers create high-quality code faster and more easily than ever before. However, building a modern compiler requires an intricate understanding of both theoretical concepts as well as practical techniques for implementing them. This book is designed to provide readers with a deep understanding of how modern compilers work by breaking down the fundamental principles into digestible units, enabling them to quickly master each concept while applying it effectively on real world scenarios. The book begins by discussing basic programming language concepts such as syntax trees, abstract syntax trees (ASTs), and intermediate representations, explaining why they exist and what their role is within a compiler's design process. It then explores various algorithms used to transform source code into machine code, covering lexical analysis, parsing, type checking, optimization, and code generation. Throughout this journey, authors will also emphasize best practices for writing robust and maintainable compilers by demonstrating ways to use debugging tools, unit testing, and profiling tools to identify bugs and improve performance. Finally, authors will conclude by reviewing current trends in compilers research and discuss areas where further development can be made to push the field forward.


# 2.词汇表
The following are some key terms used throughout the book:

Abstract Syntax Tree (AST): A tree representation of a program’s syntactic structure. It contains information about the symbols present in the program along with their relationships and operations performed on them. An AST allows programs to be analyzed, transformed, and executed more efficiently compared to using raw text or bytecode. 

Context-Free Grammar (CFG): A formal grammar that describes all possible sequences of tokens in a language. CFGs define the rules for forming valid sentences in a given context free language, but do not specify any order or associativity among the constituent elements. 

Debugging Tools: Software tools that allow developers to identify and fix errors or crashes found during compilation or execution. These tools include memory analyzers, call stack trace viewers, and logging facilities.

Intermediate Representation (IR): A higher-level assembly-like language that captures low-level details such as instructions and data structures necessary for executing a program. IRs are often generated from lower-level languages such as C or Java and serve as an input to optimization passes and code generators. 

Lexical Analyzer/Scanner: A component of a compiler that converts character streams into a sequence of lexemes (i.e., meaningful units of text) called tokens. Lexical analyzers typically perform several tasks including tokenizing strings, recognizing keywords and operators, handling whitespace, and managing comments. 

Parsing: The process of converting unstructured text into a structured format, usually represented as a parse tree or abstract syntax tree (AST). Parsers rely heavily on context-free grammars (CFGs) to define the expected patterns and make decisions based on those patterns. In addition to identifying syntax errors, parsers may also infer types and values for variables, which helps enable additional optimizations like constant folding and dead code elimination.

Semantic Analysis: The stage in the compilation pipeline after parsing where variable types and function signatures are checked against declared types and parameter lists, respectively. Semantic analysis enables powerful features like type inference and error detection, which allow developers to write cleaner, safer, and more reliable code without having to manually annotate every variable. 

Type Checker: A tool used in statically typed programming languages that verifies that expressions have appropriate types at compile time. Type checkers typically produce warnings when an expression has an unexpected type or performs an invalid operation, allowing developers to catch common mistakes early in the development cycle.

Optimization Passes: Processes that modify intermediate representations (IRs) to reduce the number of instructions required for executing a program or to enhance runtime efficiency. Optimization passes typically involve reordering instructions to maximize throughput or eliminating redundant computations altogether. 

Code Generator: Processes that convert intermediate representations into executable code, generally targeting specific hardware architectures and operating systems. Code generators take care of instruction selection, register allocation, and other aspects of generating efficient binary output that can be loaded onto a processor for execution.
