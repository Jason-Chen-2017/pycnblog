Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) refers to the task of predicting the overall sentiment of a sentence based on its specific aspects or opinions expressed by different entities or concepts within it [1]. In this article, we will review some research challenges and future directions related to ABSA. This is part one of a series of articles that will cover several important areas of AI and NLP. We hope that our insights can help scientists, engineers, and business leaders better understand the latest developments and trends in these fields. 

In recent years, ABSA has become an increasingly popular topic in various applications such as product reviews, online user reviews, social media comments, and customer service interactions. With the rapid growth of mobile devices and social media usage, ABSA also received attention from many research communities, including natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, information retrieval, knowledge representation, and human-computer interaction (HCI). However, there are still many challenges to be solved before widespread application becomes practical. Some of them include:

1. Limited Data: The amount of labeled data for training ABSA models is limited. Most existing datasets only contain short sentences with few opinions/aspects annotated, which limits their accuracy and efficiency. It requires more and diverse real-world data to achieve high performance.

2. Model Complexity: There have been many approaches proposed to address the complexity problem of aspect detection and sentiment classification tasks in ABSA. However, none of them is satisfactory yet due to the inconsistency between the input data format and output prediction format. Therefore, it is essential to design a unified model architecture for handling multiple types of inputs and outputs simultaneously. 

3. Dependency Parsing and Named Entity Recognition: Although significant progress has been made in dependency parsing technology over the last decade, named entity recognition (NER) remains challenging since they involve complex linguistic rules and context dependencies beyond syntax.

4. Evaluation Metrics and Standardization: Different evaluation metrics have been proposed to measure the quality of ABSA systems but most of them require strict handcrafted features or algorithms. It is necessary to come up with comprehensive automated evaluation metrics and standardized benchmark datasets to enable objective comparison and study across different approaches.

5. Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation: Transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques have been used extensively in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text classification and sequence labeling. They have shown promising results in improving the generalizability of learned models to new domains without requiring extensive training data. However, little work has been done to explore transfer learning and domain adaptation strategies specifically for ABSA tasks.

To summarize, there are several key challenges that need to be addressed to advance the state-of-the-art of ABSA. These include: (i) increased availability of large-scale labeled datasets; (ii) designing a consistent model architecture that can handle multiple input formats and produce multiple output predictions; (iii) exploring advanced evaluation metrics and benchmarks for measuring the effectiveness of ABSA methods; and (iv) leveraging transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques to improve the robustness and accuracy of ABSA models.

The following sections will discuss each of these challenges in detail and provide potential solutions and directions for future research. Specifically, section two will introduce basic concepts and terminology relevant to ABSA, while sections three through five will focus on the core algorithmic approach and possible improvements. Finally, section six will present a discussion on how ABSA can benefit from future HCI research in terms of human factors, cultural issues, ethical considerations, and system design. Overall, this article will provide valuable insights into current and future research topics related to ABSA and offer practical suggestions for addressing the mentioned challenges and achieving meaningful progress towards solving ABSA problems in practice.

# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
## 2.1 Word Embeddings
Word embeddings represent words as vectors in a vector space where semantic relationships and similarities between word pairs are reflected in the distance between corresponding points. A common way to generate word embeddings is to train neural networks using large corpora of text data, where each word is mapped to a dense vector representation. 

Word embeddings are widely used in natural language processing and machine learning applications because they capture latent semantics in the language, making them useful for modeling and analyzing language phenomena such as syntactic structure, morphology, and sentiment. Popular embedding spaces include Google's Word2Vec, Facebook's fastText, and Stanford's GloVe. Moreover, pre-trained word embeddings can be downloaded from publicly available repositories like GloVe or Polyglot. For example, the pre-trained GloVe embeddings trained on Twitter dataset can be downloaded at https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/. 

## 2.2 Syntactic Dependencies
Syntactic dependencies are relationships between words in phrases and larger sentences. They define the sequential order and function of words in the sentence, and thus play an important role in determining the meaning of the sentence and inferring the underlying intent or opinion behind the text [2]. Common examples of syntactic dependencies include subject-verb agreement, object–verb inversion, passive voice, coordination, relative clauses, and appositional modifiers. 

Among the most popular lexical resources for syntactic dependencies, the Penn Treebank contains a rich set of annotations for each constituent in the English parse tree. Each annotation includes the relation type (such as "nsubj" for subject), the dependent word, and the head word, among other attributes. By combining these annotations, it is possible to construct the full parse tree for each sentence. Together with the word embeddings generated earlier, this information provides another source of information for building an effective sentiment analyzer.

## 2.3 Named Entities
Named entities are groups of words that express a particular concept or idea in a text [3]. Examples of named entities include people’s names, organizations’ names, locations, and dates. Named entity recognition involves identifying and classifying these entities within unstructured textual data. Techniques include rule-based methods, heuristics, and statistical machine learning methods. Statistical methods typically use tagging schemes or dictionaries to identify known named entities, and then learn patterns and correlations between different types of named entities to assign labels automatically. Rule-based methods often rely on predefined lists of named entity tags to identify appropriate spans in text. While deep learning techniques have been recently developed to perform well on named entity recognition tasks, their effectiveness is limited by small amounts of labeled data and the lack of explicit supervision signal. 

## 2.4 Part-of-speech Tags
Part-of-speech (POS) tags classify tokens into categories such as noun, verb, adjective, etc., depending on their grammatical functions and syntactic role within the sentence [4]. POS tags play an important role in understanding the meanings of texts and controlling the behavior of downstream components such as sentiment classifiers, parsers, and named entity recognizers. For instance, the presence of certain verbs may indicate a desire or requirement, whereas the absence of certain conjunctions may suggest negativity. 

## 2.5 Semantic Roles
Semantic roles refer to properties or relations assigned to expressions in text that convey information about the speaker’s attitude or intention regarding those expressions [5]. A typical example of a semantic role is the agent role, which refers to the person or thing performing the action described by the verb phrase. Another example is the theme role, which refers to the object or topic of the utterance under consideration. Role identification exploits both syntactic and discourse cues to infer these roles. Tools for identifying semantic roles include statistical methods such as frame-semantic roles and OntoNotes, and rule-based methods such as EDU-IE scheme and MMAX. Despite their importance, however, there exists much room for improvement in both techniques and resources. 

## 2.6 Sentiment Lexicons
Sentiment lexicons are sets of manually constructed word-sentiment associations that are used to determine the polarity or emotional tone associated with individual words and phrases [6]. Typically, these lexicons are derived from opinionated writers and news sources, and consist of words characterizing positive, negative, or neutral mood or emotions expressed in prose, fiction, journalism, and web content. Sentiment lexicons have been found to significantly impact the performance of sentiment analysis algorithms, particularly when dealing with highly polarized topics such as politics, religion, and conflict. 

However, creating a sentiment lexicon from scratch requires a lot of manual effort and expertise, limiting the scale and scope of the project. Consequently, commercial services and APIs are becoming more and more affordable for obtaining sentiment lexicons. One example of such a provider is AlchemyAPI, which offers access to numerous sentiment lexicons ranging from generic ones like IBIPLEX to specialized ones like iFinity’s Current Affairs Lexicon. Commercial providers usually offer access to several languages and allow customizable parameters such as weighting coefficients and filtering criteria.
