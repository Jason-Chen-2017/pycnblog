Everything is a Mapping: Exploring AI Q-learning in Defect Detection
In this study, we propose a novel approach to defect detection using artificial intelligence (AI) Q-learning. The AI Q-learning algorithm is a powerful tool for learning optimal policies in a wide range of applications, including defect detection in manufacturing processes. We present a comprehensive literature review and analysis of the existing methods for defect detection in manufacturing processes, highlighting the limitations of traditional approaches. We then introduce the AI Q-learning algorithm, explaining its key components and how it can be applied to defect detection. Finally, we present a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting defects in a real-world manufacturing process. The results of the case study show that the AI Q-learning algorithm can achieve superior performance compared to traditional methods, while also being more robust and adaptable to changing conditions in the manufacturing environment.
