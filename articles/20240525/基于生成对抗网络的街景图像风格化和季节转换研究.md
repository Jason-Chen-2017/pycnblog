Abstractï¼šIn this paper, we propose a novel method to generate seasonally transformed and stylized street view images. To achieve this, we employ a generative adversarial network (GAN) model, which consists of a generator and a discriminator. The generator is a series of convolutional and batch normalization layers that generate a high-quality stylized image. The discriminator is a series of convolutional and batch normalization layers that determine whether the generated image is real or fake. The discriminator also provides a feature map that is used to calculate the perceptual loss. We also introduce a seasonally transformed loss that is used to encourage the generator to produce seasonally transformed images. We train the model on a dataset of real-world street view images and use it to generate a variety of seasonally transformed and stylized street view images. The results show that the proposed method can generate high-quality and realistic seasonally transformed and stylized street view images.
