Logistic regression is a type of linear model used for binary classification problems. In logistic regression, the dependent variable (the outcome we want to predict) is categorical in nature and can assume only two values: either yes or no. The goal of logistic regression is to find the best fit line that separates the data into classes based on their independent variables. It uses sigmoid function as its activation function which produces probabilities between 0 and 1. If the probability of an observation falls above a certain threshold value (usually 0.5), then it belongs to the positive class, else it belongs to the negative class. Here's how logistic regression works:

1. Collect training data consisting of input features (X) and output labels (y). X represents the information available about each example and y represents the target output/class that we would like to predict. For instance, if we were trying to build a spam classifier, our X might include word frequencies in email messages while our y might be "spam" or "not spam".

2. Use these training examples to estimate the parameters of the logistic regression equation:

   W = [w_0, w_1,..., w_p]
   b = bias term
   
Where p is the number of input features, and we need to learn the optimal weights W using gradient descent algorithm with some regularization technique such as L2 or L1 norms. We'll discuss this further later on.
   
3. After learning the parameters, use them to make predictions on new inputs x. Let Z = W^T * x + b. Then apply the sigmoid function:
   
   P(Y=yes | X=x) = 1 / (1+e^(-Z))
   
If P(Y=yes|X=x) exceeds a certain threshold (usually 0.5), classify the observation as positive; otherwise, classify it as negative. This process generates predicted outputs yhat for each input feature vector x.

The final step is to evaluate the accuracy of the model by comparing predicted vs actual outputs. There are various evaluation metrics such as accuracy score, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve etc., depending on the business problem at hand. Once we have chosen an appropriate metric, compute it using yhat generated from the model and compare it against true y values to determine how well the model performed. 

One advantage of logistic regression over other types of machine learning models is its ease of interpretability. Since the learned parameters represent the relative importance of different input features, they can be easily interpreted by humans and other stakeholders. Additionally, since it directly maps input vectors onto a probability distribution, it can also be used as a basis for more complex machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines or neural networks.

In summary, logistic regression is a powerful tool for solving binary classification problems where the output consists of two mutually exclusive classes such as spam or not spam emails, disease diagnosis results etc. It provides probabilistic estimates of the likelihood of occurrence of events and has been shown to perform well in many applications including image recognition, fraud detection, and recommendation systems. However, one drawback is that it requires careful parameter tuning and regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and handle large datasets. Overall, logistic regression is a good choice when you're dealing with small to medium-sized datasets with clear decision boundaries.

# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before diving deep into the details of logistic regression, let's understand some basic concepts and terminology related to it.
## Input Features
Input features represent the characteristics of the observations or instances being analyzed. They may be numerical or categorical in nature, and there could be multiple features per observation. These features help us describe the observed phenomenon and often serve as the input variables into our machine learning models. An important aspect of input features is that they should be relevant and informative enough to accurately capture the underlying pattern or behavior of the system under study.

For example, suppose we're building a spam detector that takes word frequency statistics as input features. One possible set of input features could be:

* Word Frequency Statistics: such as the percentage of times the word "free" appears in the email message.
* Character length of the email message
* Presence of HTML tags in the email content
* Length of URLs included in the email content
* Presence of suspicious links embedded within the email content
* Timezone of the sender
* Sender address domain name
* Recipient address domain name

We can't control every single aspect of the world around us, but we can try to identify patterns and trends that provide clues towards the presence or absence of spam. By looking closely at the spam messages and identifying similarities among them, we can develop heuristics or rules that automatically filter out non-spam messages before they reach our inbox. Similarly, we can use the extracted input features to train our spam detector to discriminate between legitimate emails and spam emails effectively without getting false positives or negatives.
