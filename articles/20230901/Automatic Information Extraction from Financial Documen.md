# 1.简介
  

Apache Tika是一个开源的、由Java编写的用于提取和转换数字文档的工具包。它提供了多种提取器插件，能够自动从各种文件类型中提取文本信息，并将其转化为标准化的数据模型。Tika支持超过100种语言，包括英文、西班牙文、法语等。它还有多个扩展接口提供对新数据类型的支持。基于Apache Tika的自动信息抽取技术可以帮助企业快速、高效地处理大量的财务文档，并应用到更多的领域中，例如金融服务、保险、信用评级等。

本文将对Tika的自动信息抽取技术进行介绍，并阐述它的工作原理、功能特点、适应场景及局限性。我们将通过分析和模拟一个实际例子展示如何运用Apache Tika实现对财务报表的自动信息抽取。

## 2.1 Tika概述
Apache Tika(TM) is a toolkit for extracting and transforming various document formats into structured data by using existing parser libraries written in Java programming language. The output of the extraction process is given as a set of metadata values or triples that represent key-value pairs about the extracted entities such as persons, organizations, places, concepts etc. These metadata can be further used to classify documents, search for relevant information, build knowledge graphs, perform named entity recognition and so on. 

The core functionality of Apache Tika includes:
* Parsing content from various file types including XML, HTML, PDF, Excel files, images etc., which are supported out-of-the-box. 
* Applying built-in parser plug-ins to extract text content and generate a normalized data model with machine learning algorithms for classification, clustering, and similarity analysis. 
* Adding new parsers through extensions interface.

## 2.2 Apache NLP Toolkit
* Tokenization - splitting sentences into individual words and punctuation marks.
* Part-of-speech tagging - assigning parts of speech to each word in the sentence.
* Named Entity Recognition - identifying and classifying named entities such as people, organizations, locations, expressions of time, quantities, etc.

## 3.1 Tika数据模型
Tika uses a Document Object Model (DOM) to represent the contents of an input document, which consists of elements such as paragraphs, headings, tables, figures, etc. Each element has its own attributes such as font size, color, alignment, position in the page, etc. The structure of the DOM is hierarchical and reflects the organization of the original document. For example, headers are nested inside sections, and tables are enclosed within their cells. Other characteristics of the DOM include section boundaries and table structures. The data obtained from the DOM is stored as plain text format along with any additional metadata extracted by the Tika framework. 

## 3.2 数据抽取流程
When we use Tika to parse financial documents, the basic idea behind it is to first convert them into a standardized data model representation, i.e., tabular format. Once this step is done, different kinds of data can be easily identified based on their semantic meaning. Some popular techniques used in Tika are regular expression pattern matching, machine learning algorithms, and rule-based approaches. Here's how Tika works when parsing financial documents:

1. Convert the financial document into a standardized data model representation such as tabular format using Apache POI (HSSFWorkbook).
2. Identify important fields such as date, amount, description, account details, customer name, vendor name, currency type, and transaction type using regex patterns.
3. Extract numerical data from the transaction amounts using Apache Math.
4. Normalize all other non-numeric fields such as dates, currencies, descriptions, customer names, vendor names, account numbers using lemmatization and stemming.
5. Store the resulting data in a SQL database for future access and manipulation.

## 3.3 性能优化
Apache Tika performs best on large and complex documents due to its ability to handle multiple threads and parallel processing capabilities. It also supports indexing features that allow users to search for specific keywords quickly without having to fully parse the entire document. However, performance issues may arise for smaller documents with limited content complexity since some plugins might not work efficiently on these small datasets. In addition, Tika only operates at character level and cannot detect relationships between words beyond what is captured in the underlying syntax tree. Therefore, it may miss certain contexts in the document that affect the understanding of the document.
