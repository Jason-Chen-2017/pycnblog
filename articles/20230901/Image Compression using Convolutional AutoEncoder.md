Image compression is a fundamental problem in digital image processing that involves reducing the size of an image while retaining its quality. One way to compress images is by using lossy algorithms such as JPEG and PNG, which reduce the number of bits used per pixel but may not retain important details in the image. In this article, we will discuss a new deep learning-based method called convolutional autoencoder (CAE) for image compression. The CAE is based on the famous autoencoder architecture introduced by <NAME> in his paper "Learning representations by backpropagating errors". We will use CAEs instead of traditional compression methods like JPEG or PNG because they are much more powerful and can achieve better results with lower computational complexity. Also, CAEs learn meaningful features from the input data and can be trained end-to-end without any pre-processing steps. Finally, our approach has several advantages over existing techniques, including:

1. Computationally efficient - Training CAEs requires fewer training examples than other compression techniques. Thus, it becomes feasible to train them on large datasets containing millions of images. Additionally, CAEs do not require fine tuning parameters after training due to their end-to-end nature. 

2. Model interpretability - Unlike typical CNN architectures, CAEs provide insight into how each layer of the network processes the input image. This makes them easier to understand and explain, especially when dealing with high-dimensional inputs.

3. Flexible representation learning - Since the CAE learns meaningful features directly from the input image, it is capable of producing representations of varying dimensions and resolutions depending on the needs of the downstream application. For example, one could extract a low-dimensional feature vector from an image and then feed it to a neural network for classification or detection tasks. 

In summary, CAEs offer significant advantages over existing techniques for compressing images while still retaining their original qualities and enabling fast computation, flexible modeling, and feature extraction. Let's dive into the technical details.
# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## 2.1 Neural Networks
A neural network is a set of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, or simply neurons. Each neuron receives inputs from other neurons and passes on information through weighted connections. These connections have associated weights that determine the strength of the signal passing along the connection. Neurons interact with the environment through input signals, which are processed by the network through activation functions. At the output layer, the network produces some form of output based on the information passed through the network.
The basic building block of a neural network is the artificial neuron, which consists of three main components: the input, output, and hidden layers. The input layer receives input signals, the output layer generates output, and the hidden layers process the incoming signals between the input and output layers. There can also be multiple hidden layers in a neural network. A neural network is trained by adjusting the weights of the connections in the network until it achieves the desired performance level.
## 2.2 Autoencoders
An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used for unsupervised learning. It is designed to learn a compressed representation of the input data by identifying patterns and relationships within the data. The aim is to generate a reconstruction of the input data that minimizes the error between the original data and its compressed version. The structure of an autoencoder typically includes two parts: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder takes the input data as input and outputs a reduced dimensional representation of the data, known as the latent space. The decoder reconstructs the original data from the latent space. During training, the goal is to minimize the reconstruction error, i.e., the difference between the input data and the reconstructed output produced by the decoder. By doing so, the autoencoder learns useful features of the input data and represents the data compactly in the latent space. To further improve the performance of the model, regularization techniques such as dropout can be applied to prevent overfitting.
