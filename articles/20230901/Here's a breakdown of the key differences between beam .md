# 1.简介
  

This article is meant for readers who are familiar with basic machine learning concepts such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning but not necessarily expert in any particular algorithm or framework. It will help to explain how different techniques work under the hood when it comes to solving problems using artificial intelligence (AI). This article will be focused on explaining key differences between beam search and traditional genetic algorithms used by AI systems.

This article assumes that you have at least some knowledge about how AI can solve complex problems like natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, etc., which require systematic approaches that involve training large neural networks and exploring multiple possible solutions simultaneously. By contrast, this article focuses more specifically on these two popular optimization methods - Beam Search and Traditional Genetic Algorithms - that are commonly used in AI applications. 

If you're just starting out, I suggest reading articles from our earlier blogs about basic AI concepts, including Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Deep Learning. These articles provide a solid foundation for understanding how AI works behind the scenes. If you want a deeper dive into specific topics, there are plenty of resources available online such as books, videos, and blog posts.

# 2.背景介绍
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to a subfield of Computer Science where computers mimic the behavior of humans and perform tasks that they would typically consider to be humanly impossible. In recent years, many researchers have been studying and developing various AI-based technologies, ranging from chatbots, virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles, and self-driving cars. Many of these technologies rely heavily on Artificial Intelligence (AI), making them highly practical and useful tools. Despite their importance, however, most people do not understand exactly what makes an AI system think or behave the way it does. In fact, it is often assumed that AI systems are mysterious machines that make decisions based on patterns and inputs without being explicitly programmed to do so. However, while this assumption may hold true in certain domains, others such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Visual Recognition, and Robotics benefit immensely from having a better understanding of how they operate.

The field of AI has evolved over time, and today we have several types of AI systems working together to accomplish tasks. One common type of AI system is called an “agent” or a “system”. An agent interacts with its environment through percepts (inputs), actuates (outputs), and receives rewards and penalties in response to those actions. The goal of an agent is to maximize its total reward over time by learning from experience. 

Traditionally, agents used evolutionary strategies to find optimal policies for their environments. Evolutionary strategies are metaheuristics that use mathematical models and techniques inspired by biology to optimize complex functions by iteratively adjusting parameters until a desired solution is found. Population-based techniques, such as genetic algorithms, stochastic gradient descent, and particle swarm optimization, also offer powerful alternatives to traditional local search algorithms for finding global optima in high-dimensional spaces. These techniques are widely used across various fields, including computer science, engineering, finance, medicine, and economics.

However, recently, deep neural networks have achieved impressive performance on numerous challenging problems in NLP, CV, and other fields. As a result, there has been significant interest in applying deep learning to areas outside of classical optimization-based methods, such as reinforcement learning, game playing, and decision making. Some AI systems now incorporate RL components in addition to other optimization techniques, such as AlphaGo and AlphaZero, respectively, which are able to learn effectively from interactive games and learn to play against itself.

In summary, modern AI relies primarily on machine learning algorithms combined with artificial intelligence principles such as deep neural networks and reinforcement learning to enable intelligent behaviors in diverse domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. While the exact mechanisms behind these techniques remain elusive, understanding how these systems function provides valuable insights into how they can improve or adapt over time to handle new challenges and generate effective outputs. 

To address the need for a deeper understanding of how AI systems work, we need to delve further into the fundamental building blocks of AI systems and explore why these algorithms differ from traditional optimization-based heuristic techniques. We'll begin by discussing one of the earliest optimization algorithms – Beam Search Algorithm – followed closely after it by another popular algorithm – Traditional Genetic Algorithms (TGA).<|im_sep|>
