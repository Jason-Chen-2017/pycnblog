Transfer learning (TL) has emerged as a powerful technique for natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis and named entity recognition by leveraging pre-trained models that have been trained on large corpora of text data. The basic idea is to leverage knowledge learned from a model trained on one task and apply it to another related but different task. However, the problem with TL is that it can only work well if both tasks share some common characteristics like word representations or sentence structures. In this article, I will discuss why transfer learning works and how it fails when applied to NLP tasks where these common characteristics do not exist. 

Natural language processing (NLP), especially as an application area of deep neural networks (DNNs), has made great advances over the past few years due to its ability to capture rich semantic information from texts. With the help of advanced techniques such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and attention mechanisms, DNNs are able to process massive amounts of unstructured text data at high accuracy rates. However, training large DNNs requires significant computational resources and time. Therefore, transfer learning has become increasingly popular in research and industry for NLP tasks that require fine-tuning existing pre-trained models on new datasets without extensive training efforts. Despite their benefits, however, there still remain challenges associated with applying transfer learning to NLP tasks with limited supervision. In particular, several factors limit the effectiveness of transfer learning:

1. Limited Common Characteristics between Tasks: NLP tasks typically involve multiple steps of feature extraction, including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, etc., which all rely on linguistic features beyond the surface level. Transfer learning cannot be directly applied to complex NLP tasks because they may lack certain linguistic features necessary for successful transfer. 

2. Insufficient Supervision: Transfer learning assumes that the target task has access to sufficient labeled examples. This assumption is often violated in real-world scenarios where annotating labelled examples is expensive or impossible. Thus, transfer learning suffers from the curse of dimensionality and sparse data. 

3. Unsuitable Pre-trained Models: Transfer learning relies heavily on pre-trained models that were originally trained on large corpora of text data. These pre-trained models are highly specialized for various natural language processing tasks and may not generalize well to other related tasks that require less specialized language understanding capabilities. Additionally, it is important to choose suitable pre-trained models that match the characteristics of the source corpus used for pre-training. A poor choice of pre-trained model could lead to suboptimal performance or even failure to learn anything useful about the specific target domain. 

To address these challenges, we need to rethink the fundamental assumptions underlying transfer learning and design effective approaches for applying it to practical NLP tasks with limited supervision. Specifically, we need to emphasize the importance of careful hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and data augmentation strategies to improve transfer learning results. We also need to further explore novel methods for generating more diverse and informative pre-trained models, and develop algorithms for adaptively selecting the most relevant subset of pre-trained features for each target task. Finally, we should evaluate transfer learning techniques under different evaluation metrics and analyze their tradeoffs and limitations carefully before adopting them into production systems.

In conclusion, while transfer learning has shown impressive results in recent years, it remains a challenging technology for practical applications and needs further exploration and development. By rethinking its core assumptions, making appropriate improvements to pre-trained models and developing algorithms for adaptive transfer learning, we can achieve stronger results and provide more reliable solutions for solving NLP problems with limited supervision.
