Visual dialog systems are attracting increasing attention due to their potential to provide engaging and intelligent conversation experience for users. However, the existing visual dialog tasks cover only a few basic categories, which makes it difficult for researchers to create new models and evaluate them in comprehensive settings. In this paper, we first conduct a systematic review of the current state-of-the-art visual dialog tasks based on four aspects - problem formulation, dataset, evaluation metrics, and task complexity level. We also propose a novel taxonomy of visual dialog tasks based on these aspects that can categorize most visual dialog problems into several subcategories. Moreover, we identify six common challenges that need to be addressed by future work towards developing more complex visual dialog tasks. Finally, we discuss some possible directions for further research in this area.

In the past decade, there has been an explosion of computer vision applications such as object detection, image classification, and segmentation, resulting in large amounts of data being collected with high resolutions. With the advances in deep learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP) technologies, machine learning algorithms have become capable of identifying objects, understanding human speech, and performing various tasks related to visual information processing. The development of visual dialog systems provides users with natural language interfaces over images and videos, enabling them to interact with machines or other people in real-time through spoken conversations. 

However, building effective and efficient visual dialog systems requires a long list of technical challenges. Existing studies focus mainly on two types of tasks - text generation and knowledge base question answering. Despite great progress made in recent years, there is still significant room for improvement and development of new visually guided dialogue systems.

This article aims to address one of the critical issues in creating visual dialog systems - how to effectively develop and test them in a comprehensive manner to evaluate their performance under different scenarios and conditions. 

To achieve this goal, we propose a systematic approach to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of visual dialog systems using a comprehensive taxonomy of visual dialog tasks. By analyzing multiple aspects including the problem definition, available datasets, evaluation metrics, and task complexity levels, our proposed taxonomy groups similar tasks together so that they can be compared and evaluated in a systematic way. This enables us to identify areas where improvements are needed and prioritize future research efforts accordingly. 

We then present six major challenges faced when designing and evaluating visual dialog systems, namely ambiguity resolution, image guidance, multimodal conversation, multi-agent communication, cross-modal reasoning, and automated feedback generation. These challenges highlight the importance of considering diverse scenarios and contexts in assessing the quality of visual dialog systems. Based on our findings, we suggest five concrete ways to move forward towards addressing these challenges, along with guidelines and suggestions to promote collaboration between research communities. 

Overall, our objective is to build a comprehensive visual dialog taxonomy and set of evaluation guidelines to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and reliability of visual dialog systems in terms of their ability to produce fluent and coherent responses across different user scenarios and contexts. This will ultimately help developers to design more effective and reliable chatbots and assistants for better user experience.

## 3.1 Computer Vision
Computer vision refers to the field of artificial intelligence (AI) concerned with the simulation of the visual world. It includes three primary components: 

1. Image acquisition - capturing and recording digital images

2. Image analysis - extracting useful information from captured images, e.g., detecting specific features or tracking movements

3. Pattern recognition - identifying patterns in image data, especially for recognizing objects and events. 

The output of each component may include a processed image or a set of information about the scene represented in the image. For example, after applying edge detection to an image, the result could be a binary image indicating whether each pixel contains a strong line or not. Similarly, image classification algorithms analyze an input image to determine what kind of object or scene is presented, such as an apple or a tree. Other pattern recognition tasks involve analyzing audio signals to recognize words pronounced in real-time or searching for specific sounds in sound clips. 

Image processing is commonly used in many applications such as medical imaging, surveillance, and augmented reality, and is supported by numerous open source libraries and tools. Some popular computer vision applications include face recognition, facial expression analysis, video surveillance, traffic monitoring, and autonomous vehicles. 

## 3.2 Natural Language Processing
Natural language processing (NLP) involves techniques that enable computers to understand and manipulate human language, specifically its syntax, semantics, and context. NLP can be broken down into two main subtasks: text understanding and text generation. Text understanding involves parsing the meaning of sentences, paragraphs, or entire documents, while text generation involves generating new texts based on given inputs. 

Text understanding is performed by various NLP models such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and dependency parsing. Part-of-speech tagging assigns a part of speech (such as noun, verb, adjective) to each word in a sentence, whereas named entity recognition identifies entities such as organizations, locations, persons, etc. Sentiment analysis determines whether the writer's attitude towards a particular subject is positive, negative, neutral, or mixed, while topic modeling discovers topics discussed in a document or corpus. Dependency parsing connects each word in a sentence to its head word, allowing a deeper understanding of the relationships between the words in a sentence. 

Text generation involves producing new written texts based on existing ones. Common methods include language modelling, sequence-to-sequence models, and transformers. Language modelling trains statistical models to predict the next word in a sentence based on previous ones, while sequence-to-sequence models learn to generate sequences of words or characters. Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies among all tokens in a sentence, making them well suited for handling long-range dependencies and managing long or unstructured sequences. 

In addition to natural language processing models, there are many pre-built APIs provided by cloud platforms like Google Cloud Natural Language API, Amazon Comprehend, IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding, Microsoft Azure Text Analytics, and Alibaba Cloud NLP SDK, which simplify the process of integrating natural language capabilities into software applications. 
 ## 3.3 Visual Dialog Systems
Visual dialog systems are conversational agents that communicate through visual interface rather than voice or text. The key feature of visual dialog systems is that they allow users to converse with the agent via images and text simultaneously, enhancing the overall user experience. There are several paradigms for visual dialog systems, including command-response, picture-based, and hybrid models. 

Command-response models typically prompt the user with a text query, which is followed up by a response generated by the agent in text format. Picture-based systems use images to describe the situation and request relevant information, leading to a more immersive and engaging conversation. Hybrid models combine both approaches by incorporating elements of both models, such as having the agent display multiple options and prompting the user to select the appropriate one.

When designing and implementing a visual dialog system, there are several important considerations to take into account, including the type of content presented to the user, the interactivity level, the ease of access, and the compatibility with mobile devices. Additionally, visualization and graphics can significantly impact the perception of the agent, which must be carefully considered during design. Ultimately, good design principles should be applied throughout the whole project lifecycle to ensure that the system delivers a smooth and enjoyable interaction between the user and agent.
 ## 3.4 Visual Dialog Tasks
A visual dialog task specifies the condition and requirements of the conversation between a user and an agent. Task definitions often require specifying the initial message, the type of utterance allowed, the expected response formats, and any constraints on the interactions within the dialog. Examples of visual dialog tasks include simple chit-chat, FAQ answering, image captioning, and action prediction. Each task can vary greatly depending on the application domain, but they share some common characteristics. 

Some key factors to consider when defining a visual dialog task include:

1. Problem Formulation - How do you want the conversation to go? Is the agent required to generate a response immediately or wait for the user's confirmation before proceeding? Are the steps sequential or parallel? What happens if the user enters incorrect information or provides incomplete information?

2. Datasets - What kinds of data and annotations are required for training and testing the model? Which datasets exist already or should be created? Should the task be limited to a single domain or include multiple domains? Should the data be balanced or sampled according to certain criteria? If the task involves multiple modalities, should they be combined or separated during training and testing?

3. Evaluation Metrics - How should the performance of the model be measured? Does it depend on accuracy, speed, memory usage, or battery consumption? Should the metric be optimized for low latency or robustness? Which evaluation datasets should be used and what are their intended purposes?

4. Complexity Level - How involved does the task appear to be? Can it be done using traditional supervised learning techniques or reinforcement learning algorithms? Will it benefit from transfer learning from related tasks or require additional resources and expertise? Do humans perform better than rule-based systems?


Based on these factors, we define eighteen visual dialog tasks based on the following categories:

1. Simple Chit-Chat - Conversations involving typical exchanges between people, usually centered around a handful of keywords, e.g., "How are you?" "What time is it?" "Where did you go?" Answer phrases contain personal preferences or opinions, such as "I'm always hungry," "You're welcome." 

2. FAQ Answering - Asking questions to elicit answers from trained personnel, such as "How can I change my credit card balance?" "Why was my order cancelled?" "Are hotels expensive today?" Answers are short and concise, sometimes providing links to external sources, such as websites or articles.

3. Image Captioning - Generating captions describing the contents of images, such as "a blue bicycle in front of trees" or "a woman sitting in a sun hat." Captions are often derived from attributes detected in the image, such as color, texture, and shape.

4. Action Prediction - Predicting actions that need to be taken based on the visual context, such as "left", "right", or "stop". Actions are often associated with a physical aspect of movement, such as steering or acceleration, and are often used in driving assistance systems.

5. Question Generation - Providing multiple choices to the user, asking them to choose the right answer(s), such as "Please choose your favorite food," "Which option suits you best?", "Choose the correct spelling.". Questions are often phrased in such a way as to challenge the user, requiring them to think critically and make a decision without being too obvious.

6. Goal-Oriented Dialogue - Involves the agent guiding the user toward a desired outcome, such as buying a car or meeting a date. The goal can either be explicit or implicit, determined by the agent or predicted by the system, and usually requires providing supporting evidence. Evidence can be expressed through image descriptions or narratives, or inferred through navigation or social cues.

7. Dialog Act Recognition - Classifying the linguistic expressions within dialogs, such as informative statements, commands, requests, and confirmations. This can be useful for downstream applications, such as automatic customer service, automated task completion, or improved recommendation systems.

8. Dialog State Tracking - Keeping track of the conversation status, such as determining when the user needs clarification or apologies before continuing. This can help optimize resource allocation, encourage conversational flow, and increase satisfaction.

9. Emotion Recognition - Identifying the emotional tone of the speaker and listener, such as joy, sadness, anger, or disappointment. This can help raise the level of empathy and reduce misunderstandings.

10. Slot Filling - Assisting the user with filling in missing pieces of information, such as "Can you please tell me your phone number?" "Could you clarify what kind of rental you prefer?" "Sorry, did you mean cheap or moderate?" Intent recognition is closely related to slot filling, as intent describes the purpose of the query and slot values describe details such as location, price range, etc.

11. Multiple-Choice Selection - Choosing between multiple options, such as "Do you like pizza?" "Should I book a hotel room now?" "What's your favorite ice cream flavor?" Options are usually chosen from a predefined set, with one choice outweighing another. This task requires careful selection of suitable examples and can be tricky to evaluate accurately.

12. Negotiation Dialogue - Requiring the parties to negotiate over an agreement, such as "What would you pay for that suitcase?" "What payment method do you accept?" "How much insurance should I add to this purchase?". Although negotiations tend to be less constrained than regular conversations, participants may struggle with selling points and knowing when to stop.

13. Autonomous Driving - Conducting conversations with an autonomous vehicle, such as "Turn left ahead." "Stop! Don't hit me!" "Brake hard and stay on the curb." The vehicle communicates through visual interface, leading to higher precision and responsiveness compared to traditional manual control.

14. Recommendation System - Suggesting items to the user based on their preference and interests, such as products, services, restaurants, movies, etc. This can be achieved using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid methods. Personalization strategies can be employed to adapt recommendations to individual user preferences.

15. Dialogue Reasoning - Gathering evidence from the conversation history, including background information, previous statements, and reasoning paths, to arrive at a final decision or conclusion, such as "Therefore, you said it yourself." "You seem very confused." "By the way, thank you for bringing those photos back." Reasoning processes rely heavily on logical inference and causal reasoning, which can be challenging for humans to apply consistently.

16. Language Modeling - Learning to predict the probability of upcoming words or sentences, such as "I am sorry.", "I don't know.", "Are you busy tonight?". Language models are widely used in natural language processing and machine translation, and can help avoid low-quality conversations or generate plausible outputs automatically.

17. Chatbot Development - Developing chatbots with customizable functionalities, languages, and dialog flows, such as "Hello, I'm Rasa and I'll help you find nearby hotels." "Welcome! Please let me know your reservation requirements." "Hi, how can I assist you today?" Many chatbot projects start with a prototype, and require iterative refinement and optimization to meet the specific user needs.

18. Multi-Agent Communication - Communicating with multiple agents simultaneously, such as a company representative and a tour guide, who exchange information through rich multimodal representations, such as maps, images, and voice recordings. This can be particularly beneficial in emergency situations where multiple stakeholders need quick access to critical information.
