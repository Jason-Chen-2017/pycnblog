Group decision making (GDM) is a crucial aspect of human intelligence and play an important role in various complex decision-making processes such as negotiations, strategic planning, resource allocation, project management, and public policy design. GDM has attracted much research attention due to its ability to address the complexity of multiple factors and variables involved in complex decisions and problems. 

However, it remains an open challenge for researchers to develop effective techniques to model, analyze, and optimize GDM strategies with realistic contextual data sets and social interactions. This review will explore the literature on group decision making to provide a comprehensive guideline for practitioners who are seeking practical guidance towards developing new GDM algorithms and applications that can effectively leverage large amounts of social and behavioral data. The article will start by summarizing the key concepts and technical approaches used in GDM modeling and analysis, followed by detailed discussion of each approach's strengths and weaknesses when applied to different types of GDM scenarios, including those related to conflict resolution, marketing strategy optimization, and economic and political decision making. Finally, we will offer suggestions for future directions and identify promising research avenues for advancing GDM technology development.

This article aims to serve as a reference manual for professional GDM researchers and engineers interested in building scalable and robust GDM models and systems capable of handling large volumes of real-world social and behavioral data. We hope this review article can inspire further research efforts and spark fruitful collaborations between research communities working on GDM and industry leaders in the fields of AI, software engineering, and business analytics.

# 2.Key Concepts and Terms
## 2.1 Group Decision Making Definition
In simple terms, group decision making refers to the process of using diverse perspectives, skills, and knowledge from within a group or team to arrive at a consensus on a shared decision. In more detail, group decision making involves resolving issues or challenges through communication, cooperation, collaboration, consensus building, and problem-solving among members of a group or organization. 

While some aspects of traditional decision making may still apply, GDM typically incorporates insights and values derived from psychology, sociology, economics, mathematics, and computer science, which enable groups to make better-informed decisions. As a result, GDM poses unique challenges compared to individual decision-making, as well as opportunities for advancement in information technology, economics, law, and governance.

### Types of Group Decision Makings
There are several categories of group decision making, depending on the nature of the decision being made. Some common examples include:

1. Conflict Resolution - involves finding a mutually beneficial solution to a dispute between two or more parties.
2. Strategic Planning - involves aligning an organization’s resources, priorities, and objectives across a wide range of stakeholders.
3. Resource Allocation - involves allocating limited resources to meet specific needs, goals, or outcomes.
4. Project Management - involves coordination of staff and stakeholders to achieve desired outcomes during the course of a project.
5. Public Policy Design - involves creating guidelines, policies, and best practices that impact millions of people around the world.

Within these categories, there exist subcategories or variations based on the context, goal, and audience. For example, conflict resolution can be further divided into regulatory conflicts, internal conflicts, external conflicts, and social conflicts. Similarly, strategic planning includes annual planning, long-term planning, strategic decision-making, intervention planning, and tactical deployment planning. Each category requires specialized tools, methods, and technologies to effectively solve the underlying problems.

## 2.2 Social Networks and Behavioral Data
Social networks are becoming increasingly popular for many reasons, including their potential to connect us together online, create a stronger sense of community, promote engagement, and boost brand reputation. Despite their importance, however, they have become too noisy and convoluted to effectively gather, store, and analyze massive amounts of behavioral data. To overcome this challenge, researchers have proposed alternative ways to collect and analyze social media data, including behavioral analysis techniques like sentiment analysis and topic modelling. However, these techniques require advanced computational power and expertise in data mining, machine learning, statistical analysis, natural language processing, and database management.

Together, social networks and behavioral data pose challenging technical problems that need to be addressed to ensure effective GDM. In addition, recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning have enabled us to build sophisticated GDM systems that can reason about social interaction patterns, emotional states, and attitudes, all while taking advantage of the vast amounts of available data sources. These advances have paved the way for new forms of automation, robotics, and virtual assistants that can help us manage our daily lives more efficiently and with greater ease. Nevertheless, GDM continues to face significant technological and scientific challenges, including data availability, interpretability, scalability, explainability, and ethical considerations. 

The next section explores the current state-of-the-art research on GDM and identifies its main techniques and methodologies, with a particular focus on deep neural network-based models and transfer learning.
