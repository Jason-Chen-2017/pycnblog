## 2.1 Voice Command Definition
A voice command is a natural language input used to control mobile devices, laptops, or other electronic devices through text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. It allows users to perform actions like playing music, controlling lights, opening apps, etc., without typing complex codes or memorizing specific phrases. People who have speech impairments often rely heavily on voice commands for day-to-day activities, and research has shown that voice commands can result in significant improvements in user satisfaction and efficiency. According to Gartner, over half of all consumer electronics devices now support voice commands, making them widely available and accessible to consumers.

The following are basic terms used when discussing voice commands:

1. Voice recognition: This refers to software that interprets human speech and converts it into computer readable signals. Some examples include Apple Siri, Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Microsoft Cortana.
2. Text-to-speech synthesis: This involves converting text into speech soundwaves suitable for human hearing. TTS systems work by processing text inputs and generating audio outputs. 
3. Natural language processing: This refers to the ability of computers to understand human languages naturally and process them effectively. NLP tools are used to analyze voice commands and interpret them into executable instructions.
4. Intent recognition: This involves extracting the meaning behind spoken sentences and determining which action should be taken based on those meanings. For example, if a person says "turn off the light," the system must determine whether they meant to turn off just one light or the entire room. 
5. Context awareness: This involves taking into account the current environment, situation, or state of the device or user to determine what action to take next. For instance, if someone asks a device to play a certain song, the system needs to know which playlist they prefer to listen to and which songs they don't like. 

These fundamental concepts form the foundation of any successful voice command design strategy. They are closely intertwined with each other and require careful attention to detail throughout the design process. Therefore, it's crucial to develop expertise in these fields before embarking on a project that aims to create engaging voice commands that resonate with different audiences.

## 2.2 Components of Successful Voice Command Design Strategy

### 2.2.1 Personal Characteristics
When designing voice commands, it's important to consider the personality traits of the intended audience. Individuals with different backgrounds, cultures, and communication styles can have different preferences regarding voice commands and their use of technology products. As such, it's essential to gather feedback and insights from different demographics to inform voice command design decisions. 

1. Gender: Different genders have distinct patterns of speaking and interacting with technology products, particularly when it comes to activating voice commands. Men tend to say things like "Alexa, open X app", whereas women might say something similar but with different terminology, like "Cortana, start Y activity". Research shows that gender differences impact both task completion time and accuracy, making it difficult to accurately predict which commands are most likely to succeed and which ones won't. 

2. Age Group: Younger generations may find it easier to learn and navigate voice commands compared to older individuals. While some young adults may have trouble understanding simple voice commands, older individuals may struggle to remember details and continue to ask for help after failing multiple times. Overall, the age group that uses voice commands may depend on their goals and interests, and guidelines should be developed accordingly.

3. Communication Style: Different individuals communicate differently depending on their accent, body language, inflection, phrasing style, and pitch. Listening to conversations between two people of different accents can yield completely different results, so it's vital to test voice command design across different communicative styles to ensure maximum compatibility.


### 2.2.2 Linguistic Features
When designing voice commands, it's critical to pay attention to the linguistic features of the intended audience. In addition to differing in dialect, accent, vocabulary, pronounciation, and communication style, it's also important to consider the way words are interpreted and processed by the device or system being designed for. For instance, some devices may not handle complex words or expressions well, requiring creativity and experimentation to come up with appropriate voice commands.

Some general linguistic features to consider include:

1. Grammatical Structure: Although there are many variations in grammar rules around the world, English has been found to be relatively consistent. However, there are still variations in how words are combined, tensed, and negated. For example, "run" could refer to running a course, going faster, or stopping. If the intention of the speaker was unclear, additional clarification may be necessary to avoid misinterpretation.

2. Punctuation: Word separation affects how a voice command is understood by the system. For example, if a sentence ends in an exclamation point, it may sound robotic and potentially frustrating. Similarly, punctuation marks may indicate pauses in the conversation and trigger hesitations, leading to confusion and errors. Therefore, it's recommended to carefully choose when to use commas, semicolons, colons, and periods to enhance clarity and readability.

3. Intonation: Different voices can have varying intonation levels, especially in informal settings where conversation is often short and casual. Careful selection of intonation and volume levels can help to establish rapport and build trust. Additionally, humorous jokes and sarcasm can also add depth and entertainment value to the interaction.

Overall, linguistic features play a crucial role in ensuring that voice commands are clear, concise, and easy to understand. Ultimately, these factors influence the overall quality of the resulting interactions and contribute to the success of any given voice command design project.

### 2.2.3 Communicative Intentions
Communicative intentions are another factor to consider when designing voice commands. For example, when a user wants to check the weather forecast, they might say "what's the weather?" Alternatively, when a person is looking for a restaurant recommendation, they might say "recommend me a place to eat." These types of statements clearly indicate what the user is looking for, enabling the system to extract the relevant information from the query and return it to the user in a format that makes sense.

However, sometimes these intentions are ambiguous and subject to interpretation. For instance, when asking a question about holidays, "is Christmas coming early this year?", it's possible that the speaker doesn't intend to specifically request a date, rather asking if the event is expected to occur in the near future. Similarly, when asking for directions, "navigate me to my office," it's unclear whether the recipient expects the direction to be provided in written form or via a map interface. Thus, it's essential to clarify the desired outcome of every voice command before proceeding further, to prevent ambiguity and errors from causing frustration and disappointment.

### 2.2.4 Social Cues
Social cues are related to factors like culture, family backgrounds, and values. When a user tries to complete a task or navigate a device, they may hear familiar phrases or gestures that give them context or reinforce established norms. A good example of a social cue is getting into a car and saying "Hey, you look swell!" when someone else greets you. These kinds of remarks can guide the user towards familiar actions or encourage them to follow established routines.

It's crucial to recognize and leverage these social cues when designing voice commands, because they can provide valuable input during the initial stages of command recognition and reduce the risk of error. Simply incorporating existing knowledge and habits of the target audience can greatly increase the chance of successfully navigating new interfaces and applications.

Overall, analyzing the personal, linguistic, communicative, and social features of the intended audience is crucial in creating effective voice commands that resonate with their communication styles, personalities, and cultural influences. With these elements in mind, the development of an effective voice command design process can lead to improved productivity, customer satisfaction, and brand loyalty.
