Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 是近几年非常火热的一个领域，主要研究对图像进行特征提取的神经网络模型。CNN 在计算机视觉领域的地位已经成为一个里程碑式的事件，它在很多任务上都取得了惊人的成绩。但是 CNN 有时也会出现过拟合的问题。为了缓解这一问题，提高 CNN 模型的泛化能力（generalization ability），需要通过正则化的方式来限制模型的复杂度。本文将详细探讨 CNN 的正则化方式及其对模型训练、泛化能力的影响。

# 2.1 CNN Overview
## Introduction to CNNs
A convolutional neural network is a type of deep learning model that was originally designed for image recognition tasks. The key feature of CNNs is their use of convolutional layers, which extract features from the input data by convolving multiple filters over the data with different sizes. These convolutional filters learn patterns in the input data and create new representations based on these learned patterns. The pooling layer reduces the spatial size of the output of the convolutional layer, reducing the number of parameters required by subsequent layers while still retaining important features from the original data. This allows the network to perform better than traditional fully connected networks because it can capture more complex relationships between input and output variables.

The basic architecture of a CNN typically includes several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling or average-pooling layers. In addition, there may be some fully connected layers at the end of the network that combine the outputs of the convolutional and pooling layers into final predictions. However, this approach has its limitations due to the quadratic nature of fully connected layers and the vanishing gradient problem. To address these issues, modern CNNs also include skip connections or residual connections that allow them to train much deeper models without the vanishing gradients issue. Additionally, regularization techniques are commonly used to prevent overfitting or improve generalization performance. There are many other advanced techniques such as batch normalization, dropout, and stochastic depth that can further enhance the accuracy and robustness of CNNs.

## Regularization Methods
Regularization is a technique that helps prevent overfitting and improves the generalization performance of machine learning models. It involves adding a penalty term to the loss function that the model uses during training to minimize. The added penalty forces the model to fit the training data well but not too closely to avoid overfitting. There are several types of regularization methods that can be applied to CNNs including:

1. Weight Decay / L2 Regularization: This method adds an L2 penalty to the weights of each neuron in the network. This encourages the model to have smaller weights and limits the degree of parameter sharing among the network’s neurons.

2. Dropout: During training, some percentage of the neurons in each hidden layer of the network will be randomly dropped out. This effectively trains the network on a subset of the available neurons and prevents co-adaptation of the neurons.

3. Data Augmentation: This method involves generating additional training samples from existing ones using transformations like rotation, scaling, or flipping. This increases the size of the dataset and makes it possible to learn more robust features from the data.

It's worth noting that different regularization methods can complement one another and provide benefits depending on the task and the specifics of the model being trained. For example, weight decay can help reduce the size of the weights leading to faster convergence but it might cause the model to suffer from overfitting if the penalty is too high. On the other hand, dropout often performs better than weight decay but requires careful hyperparameter tuning to achieve good results. Overall, experimentation is essential to find the best combination of regularization methods for your particular scenario.
