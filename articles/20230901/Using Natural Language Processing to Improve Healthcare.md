## 一、业务背景介绍
Healthcare industry has been facing a crisis since the COVID-19 pandemic. The vast amounts of data generated by various devices and sensors have provided new opportunities for researchers to improve patient care and provide better treatments. In particular, natural language processing (NLP) techniques can help extract insights from medical records and clinical notes that are often unstructured or inaccurate. These insights could be used to enhance current treatment procedures and optimize future decision making processes. However, developing robust NLP models requires a large amount of labeled training data with high quality annotations. This is a daunting task for healthcare organizations where human resources are limited. Therefore, building an NLP system that can effectively detect relevant information within unstructured text would greatly benefit healthcare delivery. 

In this article, we will explore how natural language processing can be leveraged to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare delivery. We will use Python programming language to develop our solution using libraries such as spaCy, NLTK, scikit-learn, etc. Specifically, we will focus on using machine learning algorithms to classify medical records based on their content. By analyzing the medical record texts, we hope to identify patterns that indicate which medications should be given first to patients and what factors may contribute to patient adherence issues. We will also look into ways to predict future patient needs based on historical data and insights extracted from the medical records.

## 二、核心概念及术语说明
### 2.1 NLP概述
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) concerned with enabling computers to understand and manipulate human languages naturally. It involves the design and development of computational systems that enable machines to analyze and generate human language, either verbatim or paraphrased, through digital communication interfaces. 

The core components of NLP include:
1. **Corpus**: A collection of documents, speech, images, or other types of data that contains linguistic material.

2. **Tokenizer**: Splits the corpus into individual words or sentences. 

3. **Stop Word Removal**: Removes common stop words like "the" and "and". 

4. **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Converts words to their base form or root word. 

5. **Part-of-speech Tagging**: Assigns part-of-speech tags to each token (e.g., noun, verb, adjective). 

6. **Named Entity Recognition**: Identifies named entities in text (e.g., people, locations, organizations). 

7. **Sentence Boundary Detection**: Finds sentence boundaries in text. 

8. **Word Sense Disambiguation**: Determines the correct meaning of words with multiple meanings. 

9. **Word Embeddings/Vectors**: Maps words to vectors in order to represent them in vector space. 

10. **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Uses statistical analysis to train and evaluate models that can perform complex tasks like sentiment classification, topic modeling, spam filtering, and recommendation systems. 

### 2.2 数据集简介
We will be working with the Medical Appointment NoShows dataset [1] consisting of medical appointment records collected from over 100k unique patients who had appointments with hospitals in Brazil between March-April 2020. Each row represents one medical appointment record with patient demographics, past medical history, procedure codes, diagnosis code, follow-up schedule, etc. Additionally, we will be splitting this dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to test the accuracy of our models. 

### 2.3 模型选型
For this problem, I am planning to build a binary classification model - whether the patient showed up for their scheduled appointment or not. Binary classification refers to classifying a problem into two possible outcomes - e.g., yes or no, true or false, positive or negative, etc. Here are some of the potential features we might consider including in our model:

1. Patient demographics (gender, age, race, marital status): One reason why hospital visits may be cancelled is because of patient's medical conditions or personal reasons. To prevent these cancellations, it helps if we know the demographic characteristics of patients before they visit the hospital.

2. Past medical history: Understanding past diagnoses and medications can lead to more accurate treatment plans and reduce patient dissatisfaction. We might want to incorporate this information into our model to increase its performance.

3. Procedure codes: Procedures performed during an appointment usually have associated risk factors that affect patient outcomes. Including these codes in our model can help inform predictions about patient outcomes and make more targeted recommendations.

4. Diagnosis code: Based on previous experience, certain symptoms may trigger additional diagnostic tests or procedures. Including the diagnosis code alongside other features can further refine our predictions and recommend optimal treatment plans.

Based on these features, we can create different combinations of input variables and train different machine learning algorithms to see which ones give us the best results. For example, we might try logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, support vector machines, deep neural networks, or even ensemble methods like bagging and boosting to see which performs the best.
