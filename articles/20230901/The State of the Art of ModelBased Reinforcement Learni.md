Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) is a class of reinforcement learning algorithms that learn models of the environment to guide decision making and achieve higher performance than other methods in certain environments. The key idea behind MBRL lies in decoupling action selection from model construction, allowing for more efficient exploration during training by using learned policies directly on real robots or simulators without the need for expensive real-world testing. This paper provides an overview of MBRL as well as its current state of the art, including relevant applications and challenges. We also discuss recent progress towards developing scalable MBRL algorithms capable of solving complex tasks such as locomotion control under various constraints. Finally, we conclude with some open research directions in this field.

In this article, we will first introduce the basic concepts, terminology, and history of MBRL. Then, we present the core algorithmic principles underlying MBRL and describe how they can be used to solve common problems in reinforcement learning. We next demonstrate implementation details for several representative MBRL algorithms and showcase their effectiveness across different scenarios. Next, we highlight key challenges and limitations associated with MBRL and propose future work on scaling up these algorithms to handle increasingly complex tasks. Finally, we provide a discussion on open research issues related to MBRL. 

This article aims to provide a comprehensive and detailed account of MBRL, covering both theory and practice, and providing a practical framework for developers interested in applying MBRL techniques to advance reinforcement learning. By unifying existing research efforts into one coherent body of knowledge, this article will facilitate research collaborations between the MBRL community and others within the machine learning and robotics communities. Moreover, it should serve as a valuable reference resource for practitioners and enthusiasts who are seeking to understand and apply modern MBRL algorithms to new domains and problems.



# 2. Background: Introduction
## 2.1 History
Reinforcement learning (RL) has been a powerful tool for modeling complex systems and optimizing decisions based on observed rewards over time. However, limited success has been achieved when RL was applied to complex decision-making tasks in uncertain and dynamic environments. To address this issue, model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) emerged as an alternative approach to RL that leverages statistical modeling of the system dynamics to make predictions about future states and actions. Despite significant advances, however, MBRL remains challenging to implement, requiring careful tuning of hyperparameters, expert demonstration datasets, and offline data collection procedures. In response, more advanced and computationally efficient optimization algorithms have recently emerged, but there is still much room for improvement in terms of sample complexity and computational efficiency.


## 2.2 Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) is a family of reinforcement learning techniques that leverage statistical modeling to improve agent performance in complex decision-making tasks. Traditional RL algorithms assume that the true dynamics of the environment are unknown and rely solely on trial-and-error experience to estimate value functions and policies. On the other hand, MBRL builds representations of the environment's dynamics through probabilistic inference techniques, which enable agents to reason about possible outcomes before taking actions and take advantage of model uncertainty to achieve better results. 


Model-based RL algorithms typically consist of three components: an observation model that maps observations to states, a transition model that predicts future states given past states and actions, and a reward function that evaluates the goodness of each state visited during training. Additionally, MBRL relies heavily on domain knowledge and prior experience to accurately define these models. For example, a model-free method may only use the transition matrix to predict future states, whereas a model-based method may incorporate motion primitives, sensor noise, and disturbance effects into the representation. Ultimately, the goal of MBRL is to automate the process of building and refining models, enabling agents to adapt quickly to changes in the world.


Some prominent MBRL techniques include behavior cloning (BC), which learns optimal behaviors from expert demonstrations, DAgger (Data Aggregation), which uses expert policy execution feedback to update models iteratively, and hierarchical planning, which breaks down complex tasks into subtasks and addresses them independently before aggregating their solutions. Other approaches, such as skill-focused imitation learning (SIL), deep reinforcement learning (DRL), and metalearning, aim to bridge the gap between supervised and reinforcement learning by leveraging human skills and transfer learning. Overall, MBRL promises to significantly advance the state of art in reinforcement learning by enabling robust and adaptive decision-making in challenging environments.
