# 1.简介
  

Data Science has been making tremendous strides over the past few years and is now considered one of the most versatile fields in tech industry. Data scientists work closely with business analysts, developers, engineers, mathematicians, statisticians etc., to extract valuable insights from large volumes of data. Their skillset includes machine learning algorithms, statistical models, and programming languages such as Python, R, SQL, Java etc., that are used to analyze, process, transform, visualize, and interpret data. 

However, it can be challenging for even experienced data scientists to transition into this field due to numerous factors such as: lack of clear guidance, low salary, limited training opportunities, high turnover rates, short-term commitment issues, misconception about the role, frustrated by errors or failures, fear of being labeled as an AI language model etc. Therefore, there is a need to create easy-to-follow step-by-step guides, available online and at no cost, for those who want to become proficient in Data Science. This article aims to provide a simplified version of the famous "8 steps to become a data scientist" guide by IBM Cognitive Classroom, but without any additional details regarding specialization or certifications required. These steps will help you make significant progress towards becoming a successful data scientist within six months. 

# 2.Basic Concepts & Terminologies
In order to succeed in this field, it's crucial to understand fundamental concepts and terminology related to Data Science. Some basic terms and concepts include:

1. Data Mining: It refers to processes of extracting knowledge from massive amounts of raw data using various techniques such as pattern recognition, classification, clustering, regression analysis, and neural networks.

2. Machine Learning: It is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from experience, identify patterns, and make predictions on new inputs based on prior knowledge. There are several types of machine learning methods including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. 

3. Big Data: Refers to volume, variety, and velocity of data that needs to be analyzed quickly. Big data consists of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data types which requires different approaches to handle them.

4. Statistics: It is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data in ways that effectively communicate information. It involves gathering, evaluating, summarizing, and drawing conclusions from numerical facts.

5. Data Visualization: It is the process of representing data visually through graphs, charts, and other visual representations that enable decision-making and understanding.

6. Programming Languages: They allow developers to write computer programs to perform complex tasks. Popular programming languages include Python, R, Scala, Matlab, and Java.

7. Database Management Systems: They store, retrieve, update, and manage data sets. Various database management systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Oracle, and SQLite are widely used in Data Science projects.

8. Cloud Computing Platforms: They offer reliable computing resources that can be accessed over the internet. Popular cloud platforms include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Alibaba Cloud, and IBM Cloud.

The above mentioned concepts and terminologies form the foundation of every data scientist's toolkit.

# 3.Core Algorithms and Operations
Now let's move ahead and dive deeper into some core algorithms and operations related to Data Science. 

1. Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics describe basic features of a dataset like mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation, quartiles, correlation coefficients, skewness, kurtosis, outliers, and missing values. 

2. Predictive Analytics: It involves predicting future outcomes based on current events, trends, or patterns. Different prediction models like linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), random forests, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and artificial neural networks (ANN) are used to build accurate predictive models.

3. Time Series Analysis: Time series analysis involves modeling and forecasting time-based dependent variables like sales, stock prices, weather patterns, or traffic flows. ARIMA, ETS, VARX, GARCH, LSTM, or MLP models are commonly used for time series analysis.

4. Text Analytics: Text analytics involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques that allow users to extract meaningful insights from textual data. Common NLP tasks include sentiment analysis, entity recognition, topic modeling, and named entity recognition.

5. Image Processing: Image processing involves detecting and identifying objects, faces, and scenes in images. Computer vision techniques like feature detection, object recognition, face recognition, and segmentation are used for image processing.

6. Recommendation Systems: Recommendation systems recommend products or services to users based on their preferences and choices. Collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid recommendation engines are commonly used for building recommender systems.

There are many more advanced topics not covered here, but these are just a few examples of popular algorithms and operations used in Data Science. Now we have a better idea of what our target audience should expect from us when they read our blog post.
