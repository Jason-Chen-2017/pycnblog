Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a field of computer science and machine learning that focuses on enabling machines to perform tasks or functions that would typically require human intelligence and emotional responses. Over the last decade, artificial intelligence has become an important part of our daily lives as it helps us to perform complex tasks like reading emails, understanding natural language, speaking with robots, and answering customer service queries more accurately than humans can. In this article, we will explore various aspects related to artificial intelligence from its history to popular applications in fields such as medicine, finance, transportation, law enforcement, healthcare, education, and gaming.  

In this illustrated guide, we will cover overviews of different types of AI algorithms, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning, and evolutionary computation. We will also discuss about how AI models work behind the scenes and their advantages and limitations. Finally, we will provide you with detailed tutorials for building and applying AI models using Python programming languages.

To understand each topic thoroughly, we will focus on theory, concepts, mathematical formulas, code examples, and practical implementations. By the end of the guide, readers should be able to gain insights into the world of artificial intelligence and implement exciting projects using modern techniques.
