# 1.简介
  

Attention mechanism is a powerful concept in deep learning that enables the model to focus on relevant information and ignore irrelevant ones efficiently. In this article, I will go over the main concepts of attention mechanisms and explain how they work using a simple image classification task as an example. The end result will be a high-level overview of attention mechanisms and an illustrative visualization for better understanding. At the same time, we will also provide a step-by-step code implementation alongside explanations about each part of the algorithm. Overall, this article aims at providing beginners and advanced readers alike with a clear and well-organized explanation of the attention mechanism architecture.


# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before diving into the details of the attention mechanism, let's first understand some basic concepts and terminology related to it:

1. Inputs/Queries/Keys - These are the inputs provided by the network to compute the attention weights. They can represent different features like text or images. Queries typically attend to specific parts of the input while keys usually capture global patterns within the input. For instance, given an image, queries could correspond to different objects such as eyes, mouths, etc., while keys might represent overall color and texture characteristics. 

2. Value vectors - Each key corresponds to one value vector which captures more detailed information regarding its corresponding query. This helps in computing attention scores between queries and values.

3. Attention Scores - This is the output of the attention mechanism that gives us a weightage indicating how much each query should pay attention to each value. It is computed based on the similarity score between the query and all available keys in the current iteration. A softmax function is then applied to normalize these scores so that they sum up to 1 across all keys. Higher scores indicate higher importance while lower scores indicate lower importance.

4. Weighted Sum - Finally, we multiply each value vector by its respective attention score to get their weighted sum. By doing so, we obtain a representation of the original input where only the important parts are retained and the rest is suppressed according to the attention weights.

5. Memory Bank - This is another important component of attention mechanisms that stores information from previous iterations and allows the model to retain information even if there is limited memory space.

6. Multi-head Attention - This technique involves splitting the query, key and value vectors into multiple heads and applying attention independently on them. This results in better representations compared to single head attention and reduces redundancy in representing complex relationships between queries, keys and values.

7. Scaled Dot-Product Attention - This is the most commonly used attention mechanism that computes the attention scores based on the dot product between the query and key vectors. However, this approach has been shown to have several drawbacks and biases, including posibility of vanishing gradients, slow convergence, and instability during training. Therefore, researchers have proposed various alternatives like additive attention, multi-headed self-attention, and scaled dot-product with learnable temperature parameter.

8. Positional Encoding - This is a learned vector added to the input embeddings that captures relative positioning between tokens within the sequence. It helps the model learn positional dependencies and improves the performance of transformer models. 

Let's now move onto the core components of the attention mechanism:

1. Softmax Function - The softmax function normalizes the attention scores to lie between zero and one and thus ensure that they sum up to 1 across all possible keys. We use the softmax function as our activation function when computing the attention weights.

2. Query, Key and Value Vectors - We concatenate the queries, keys and values together to form tensors of shape [batch_size, num_heads, seq_length, d_model // num_heads]. Here, batch_size represents the number of samples in our dataset, num_heads represents the number of independent attention heads, seq_length represents the length of sequences being considered, and d_model represents the dimensionality of the feature space. To perform multi-head attention, we repeat the above tensor num_heads times along the second axis to create multiple copies of each tensor. Then we split the resulting tensor into three subtensors corresponding to queries, keys and values respectively. These subtensors are further processed using the following steps:

     i) Linear Transformation - First, we apply linear transformations to convert the queries, keys and values from d_model dimensional space to d_k dimensional space (where d_k is smaller than d_model). The goal here is to reduce the dimensions of the vectors and keep the relationship between queries, keys and values intact.

      ii) Splitting and Concatenation - Next, we reshape the transformed tensors into new shapes [batch_size * num_heads, seq_length, d_k] for queries, keys and values. We then split the concatenated tensor into chunks of size d_k. After this operation, we obtain three submatrices of shape [batch_size * num_heads, seq_length, d_k / num_heads], each corresponding to one set of queries, keys and values.

    iii) Scaled Dot Product Attention - Now, we compute the attention scores between queries and keys using the formula:

        a_{ij} = \frac{\text{query}_i^\top \text{key}_j}{\sqrt{d_k}}
        
        b_{ij} = \mathrm{softmax}(a_{ij})

        c_{ij} = \text{value}_j
    
    Where $\text{query}_i$ refers to the $i$-th row of the $i$-th query matrix, $\text{key}_j$ refers to the $j$-th row of the $j$-th key matrix, and $\text{value}_j$ refers to the $j$-th row of the $j$-th value matrix. The attention scores $a_{ij}$ range between zero and one and represent the degree of similarity between the $i$-th query and the $j$-th key. The multiplication of $\text{query}_i^\top \text{key}_j$ produces a scalar value which is then passed through the softmax function to produce the attention weights $b_{ij}$. Finally, we multiply each value vector $c_{j}$ by its respective attention weight $b_{ij}$ to get their weighted sum.

3. Residual Connection and Layer Normalization - Residual connection is used to prevent vanishing gradients and improve the stability of the neural networks during training. During training, we add the outputs of each layer to the input itself before passing it through the next layer. The reason behind adding the two is that the addition preserves the information present in both layers, which enhances the ability of the model to generalize better and prevents overfitting. Another technique known as layer normalization is used to standardize the inputs to a layer to help in faster and more stable optimization. Specifically, the layer normalization process consists of subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the inputs across the channel dimension. This ensures that each channel receives normalized inputs that do not depend too heavily on other channels.

4. Masking - One common issue faced by many attention mechanisms is the presence of padding tokens in the input sequences. Padding tokens may cause the model to waste computation on irrelevant information and hinder its ability to focus on meaningful elements in the input. Therefore, masking is employed to disregard the padded positions in the computations. The masks are created to identify the padded positions and make sure that the model does not include any effect from those positions when computing the attention weights. There are two types of masks:
    
     i) Sequence Mask - This type of mask is applicable when the entire sequence is treated as a single entity. That means, every token attends to every other token in the sequence. Hence, the diagonal entries of the attention matrices become masked out since they refer to the same element.
     
     ii) Padding Mask - This type of mask is applicable when individual sequences in the batch are padded with zeros after reaching a fixed length. As such, the attention mechanism knows not to attend to the non-existent padding tokens beyond the actual sequence lengths. 
     
    Using either of the above mentioned masks makes the model aware of the true structure of the input sequences and helps it in focusing effectively on the relevant information.
      
# 3. Algorithmic Steps and Math Explanation
Now that we know what attention mechanism is, let's break down the major steps involved in implementing it:

1. Input Embedding - The input embedding layer takes raw data and maps it into a dense vector representation called a Feature Map. Commonly used techniques for embedding are word embeddings, character embeddings, and BERT embeddings.

2. Multi-Head Attention - The primary objective of multi-head attention is to allow the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. Thus, it splits the input into multiple subspaces and applies attention separately on each subspace. Specifically, it creates multiple attention heads, each responsible for capturing local and global interactions around certain locations in the input. The final output is obtained by combining the attention heads and applying dropout regularization.

3. Feed Forward Network - The feed forward network is responsible for transforming the aggregated information obtained from the multi-head attention block into a suitable representation for downstream tasks. It contains two fully connected layers followed by ReLU activation functions and dropout regularization.

4. Output Layer - The output layer transforms the output of the feed forward network into a probability distribution over the target classes.
