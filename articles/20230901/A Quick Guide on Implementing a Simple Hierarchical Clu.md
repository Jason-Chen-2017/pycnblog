# 1.简介
  

Hierarchical clustering is one of the most popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms that allows us to group similar data points into clusters based on their similarity or distance measures. In this article we will implement a simple hierarchical clustering algorithm using scikit-learn library in Python and explore its working principles step by step with real world examples. The goal of this guide is to provide an intuitive understanding of how hierarchical clustering works and why it’s important for various applications such as text analysis, image processing, bioinformatics, and more. To achieve these goals, I have divided this article into six sections: 

1) Background Introduction 
2) Basic Concepts & Terminology 
3) Core Algorithm Principles & Steps 
4) Code Examples and Explanations 
5) Future Trends and Challenges 
6) Appendix - Common Questions and Answers. 

In each section, we’ll discuss some key concepts related to hierarchical clustering and explain what they mean in detail alongside code examples demonstrating how to apply them using Python libraries like scikit-learn. This article assumes basic knowledge about supervised and unsupervised machine learning models, regression, classification, and other statistical techniques used in natural language processing (NLP).

Before moving forward, let's understand some fundamental terms and concepts related to hierarchical clustering which are essential for our further exploration. We'll use this terminology throughout the article to define the different components involved in hierarchical clustering and communicate better about the algorithm itself.

2.1. Data Points
Data points are simply individual entities/objects that we want to cluster together. Each data point can be represented by a vector of features or attributes which represent its characteristics or properties. Some common examples of data points include people, organizations, products, or diseases. For example, if you had a dataset containing information about customers, you could cluster the data points based on their purchase behavior, preferences, demographics, etc.
The number of data points can vary from case to case depending on your specific problem statement.

2.2. Distance Measure
A distance measure refers to a way to calculate the difference between two objects or data points. When performing hierarchical clustering, we need to determine the optimal distance metric between data points so that the resulting groups are well defined and meaningful. There are many distance metrics available including Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Minkowski distance, cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity coefficient, and more. It all depends on the type of data you're dealing with and the desired result after clustering. For instance, when clustering texts or documents, it may make sense to use Levenshtein distance since it takes into account both word order and spelling differences. On the other hand, if you're clustering images, KL divergence might be more suitable because it considers only the probabilities of the pixel values instead of their absolute values. Overall, choosing the right distance metric often requires a good understanding of the underlying structure of your data and the problem at hand.

2.3. Linkage Criteria
Linkage criteria refers to the method used to merge the clusters at each level of the hierarchy. Some commonly used linkage criteria are single linkage, complete linkage, average linkage, centroid linkage, Ward variance minimization, and others. These methods describe how to combine the pairwise distances between data points to form new clusters at each level of the hierarchy. Single linkage means that the minimum distance between any two members of two clusters is chosen as the threshold for merging those clusters, while complete linkage means that the maximum distance between any two members of two clusters is chosen. Average linkage combines the two best pairs of clusters according to their average distance, whereas centroid linkage uses the geometric center of each cluster as the representative point. Similarly, Ward variance minimization uses the within-cluster sum of squares deviation as the cost function to minimize the total variance among all clusters. All these methods have their own advantages and disadvantages but ultimately depend on the context and nature of your data.

2.4. Dendrogram
A dendrogram is a tree-like diagram representing the hierarchical relationship between the original data points and their corresponding clusters formed during hierarchical clustering. It shows the relationships between data points at each level of the hierarchy and indicates the height at which two clusters are merged. By examining the shape and size of the branches in the dendrogram, we can see whether there exists clear separation between the original clusters and their respective subclusters. If the shapes of the branches do not resemble a well-defined pyramid pattern, then the linkage criteria chosen may not be appropriate. Additionally, smaller branch lengths indicate larger separation between clusters, suggesting that there isn't much overlap between them. Therefore, adjustments to the linkage criteria may be necessary.
