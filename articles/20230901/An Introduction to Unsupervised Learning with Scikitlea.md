# 1.简介
  


Unsupervised learning is a class of machine learning algorithms where the goal is to identify patterns and relationships in data without being provided any labeled training examples. The most common unsupervised learning techniques are clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection. 

Scikit-learn provides several built-in unsupervised learning algorithms such as k-means clustering, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, etc., which can be used for clustering, visualization, and analysis tasks. In this article, we will focus on explaining how these algorithms work using Python code. We will also discuss some popular applications of unsupervised learning and present their real world use cases.

# 2.基本概念、术语和定义
## 2.1 Basic Terminology and Concepts
Let's start by defining some basic concepts and terminologies that will help us understand the basics of unsupervised learning:

1. **Data**: Data refers to the collection of observations or instances from a given set of variables or features. It could be numerical, categorical, textual, image, audio, or video. 

2. **Instance/Observation** : Each instance consists of multiple attributes (features) describing its characteristics. For example, an instance might have two features representing age and income, while another instance might have three features representing height, weight, and blood type.  

3. **Feature** : A feature represents a measurable property or characteristic of an instance. Features could be continuous or discrete values like age, salary, occupation, etc. Continuous features represent quantitative measurements, while discrete features represent categories or labels.

4. **Clustering** : Clustering is the process of dividing a dataset into groups based on similarities between the instances within each group. Clusters may contain different classes or clusters, but they should share some underlying structure. Common clustering methods include K-Means, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering. 

5. **Dimensionality Reduction** : Dimensionality reduction involves reducing the number of features in a dataset by identifying redundant or irrelevant features and transforming the original dataset into a new one with fewer dimensions. Common techniques include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). 

6. **Anomaly Detection** : Anomaly detection involves identifying unexpected or rare occurrences in a dataset that do not conform to expected behavior. Common approaches include Local Outlier Factor (LOF), One Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM), Isolation Forest, and Autoencoder.

## 2.2 Model Selection and Evaluation Metrics
We need to select an appropriate model depending on our problem statement and available resources. Some commonly used evaluation metrics for evaluating cluster models include Silhouette Coefficient, Adjusted Rand Index, and Dunn Index. Additionally, there are other performance metrics specific to certain types of clustering algorithms such as V-measure, Calinski-Harabasz Index, and silhouette score.

## 2.3 Types of Problems and Applications
Some popular problems that involve unsupervised learning include:

1. **Customer Segmentation:** Customer segmentation involves categorizing customers into different groups based on shared preferences, behaviors, and demographics. This technique can be useful in marketing, sales, and customer service sectors.

2. **Document Clustering:** Document clustering involves grouping similar documents together based on the topics, keywords, and content contained in them. This can be useful in searching engines, scientific publishing, and news aggregation sites.

3. **Image Segmentation:** Image segmentation involves partitioning an image into regions that are likely to contain objects or structures of interest. This can be useful in computer vision, medical imaging, and geospatial analysis areas.

4. **Market Segmentation:** Market segmentation involves dividing companies into various segments based on factors such as product pricing, revenue, competition, market share, and size. This can be useful in research, investment, and retail industries.
