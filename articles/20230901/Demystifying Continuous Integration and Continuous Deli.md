# 1.简介
  

Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where code changes are automatically integrated into a shared repository several times a day or every hour using automated build tools. It helps to catch errors early in the development cycle before they cause problems in production. Continuous delivery, on the other hand, means releasing all or parts of an application automatically as soon as it passes through testing and integration stages, ensuring that each change made to the codebase is delivered safely and reliably to customers. CI/CD can help organizations reduce risk by finding and fixing bugs earlier in the process, improving efficiency, and reducing time-to-market for new features. By automating these processes, organizations save time and money, while also meeting compliance requirements such as security and governance standards. However, many companies still struggle with implementing CI/CD effectively, especially when multiple teams work together across different functional boundaries and geographies. In this article we will explore the key drivers, challenges, technologies, and best practices involved in building and delivering reliable and secure applications using continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). We will cover best practices like branching strategies, commit messages, test automation, deployment environments, monitoring, and security measures. This knowledge should be helpful to both IT and non-IT professionals working in agile development organizations.

# 2.关键概念
## 2.1. CI vs CD
In traditional software engineering, release management was often done manually, which could take days or weeks depending on the size and complexity of the project. With the advent of CI/CD, developers can automate the process of integrating their code changes more frequently and quickly, leading to shorter lead times between fixes and feature releases. The CI pipeline consists of automatic builds triggered by commits, tests run against those builds, and artifacts generated from successful builds sent to a centralized artifact repository. Once the CI pipeline has verified that the code works properly, the code can then be promoted to a separate environment for further testing and validation before being released to end users. This makes it easier to identify issues before they reach live users, reduces downtime, and increases confidence in the quality of the final product. On the other hand, the CD pipeline involves deploying the latest version of the application to various deployment environments after passing thorough testing. Deployment can happen automatically based on predetermined criteria, giving organizations greater control over when updates are deployed. 

## 2.2. Main Drivers of CI/CD Adoption
The following are some of the main drivers of CI/CD adoption:

1. Faster Feedback Loop: Improved feedback loop leads to faster identification and resolution of issues, which leads to better customer satisfaction and improved revenue generation. Shorter lead times mean less waste and increased business value.
2. Better Collaboration: Teams can collaborate closely throughout the entire development lifecycle, enabling them to tackle complex problems together and improve communication and teamwork skills. 
3. Increased Security: Automation improves security by reducing the number of potential points of failure and eliminating human error. Security vulnerabilities can be detected early during the development phase, making it harder for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.
4. Reduced Costs: Implementing CI/CD can result in significant cost savings compared to manual processes. Paying for third-party services and maintaining infrastructure costs can decrease overall spend.  
5. Improved Quality Assurance: By automating testing and validation steps, the CI/CD process ensures high quality products at lower costs than manual methods. 
6. Improve Customer Experience: Customers have a seamless experience interacting with an application due to its availability and responsiveness. 

## 2.3. Challenges of Implementing CI/CD Efficiently 
There are certain challenges associated with implementing CI/CD efficiently:

1. Pipeline Overhead: Implementing a robust CI/CD pipeline requires setting up a variety of tools and resources, including virtual machines, cloud platforms, repositories, and so forth. Proper planning and execution are essential to ensure success. 
2. Configuration Complexity: Automated pipelines require careful attention to details, especially when dealing with configurations, dependencies, and secrets. Errors can creep in and cause headaches if not addressed correctly. 
3. Communication Bottlenecks: Working across diverse functions and locations can create communication barriers that hinder effective collaboration. Successful implementation requires constant communication between stakeholders, sponsors, and subject matter experts. 
4. Lack of Infrastructure: Many enterprises may lack the necessary infrastructure to support their CI/CD needs. Manual processes can become increasingly expensive, even when employing third-party vendors. 

## 2.4. Tools Used in CI/CD Pipelines
Here's a list of common tools used in CI/CD pipelines: 

1. Version Control System: Git and Mercurial are two popular version control systems widely used in CI/CD pipelines. GitLab, GitHub, and Bitbucket provide hosting capabilities for version control repositories. 
2. Build Servers: Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, TeamCity, Bamboo, etc., are commonly used for executing automated builds. These servers can be configured to trigger builds upon detection of specific events, such as pushes to source repositories or merge requests. 
3. Artifact Repository: Maven Central, Nexus, Artifactory, npmjs.com, Docker Hub, Google Container Registry, etc., serve as repositories for storing compiled artifacts generated by the CI system. They act as a bridge between build jobs and the rest of the development ecosystem. 
4. Test Automation Frameworks: Selenium WebDriver, Appium, Robot Framework, Behave, Cypress, Jest, Mocha, etc., are popular frameworks for writing and running automated tests. They can be integrated with CI/CD tools to execute tests within the same build job, providing immediate feedback on any issues found. 
5. Release Management Software: Jira, TFS, Confluence, etc., are used for managing deployments and release notes. They allow engineers to track progress and communicate information across different departments. 

## 2.5. Key Techniques
Key techniques involve selecting proper branching strategy, choosing the right types of checks required for code quality, selecting the most suitable containerization technology, configuring logging and metrics collection mechanisms, and implementing load balancing techniques to distribute traffic among multiple instances of the application. 

### Branching Strategies
Branching Strategy refers to the methodology followed by the organization in creating branches for developing, testing, and eventually merging changes back into the master branch. There are several strategies that organizations use for branching:

1. Traditional Branches: The first approach to branching involves creating separate branches for individual tasks. Developers would branch off the master branch to develop features, fix bugs, or add new functionality. When the task is complete, they would merge the changes back into the master branch for review. This approach suffers from low scalability and maintenance since there might be too many active branches leading to conflicts and delays in resolving conflicts.
2. Feature Branching: Another approach is called feature branching. Here, developers create small independent branches for each feature or bugfix. Changes can be merged directly into the master branch without going through extensive testing. Features developed on feature branches can later be merged into the master branch via pull request approval. This approach allows for more frequent releases but comes with higher overhead due to the need for reviewing and approving code.
3. Gitflow Workflow: The gitflow workflow is a popular way of branching in large teams. It follows a strict set of conventions for how to manage projects with three permanent branches - master, develop, and feature branches. Each developer develops code on his own fork of the develop branch. He completes unit and integration tests before submitting a PR to the develop branch for peer review and acceptance. If everything looks good, the developer creates a new release branch from the develop branch and prepares the documentation for release. Finally, he merges the release branch back into the master branch.

### Commit Messages
Commit messages play a crucial role in keeping track of changes in a codebase. Good commit messages make it easy to understand what changes were made, why they were made, and what caused the issues they fixed. The message must include clear instructions for other developers to follow along and reproduce the changes locally. The following guidelines should be kept in mind:

1. Use Imperative Mood: The title of your commit message should start with "Fix," "Update," or "Add" instead of simply indicating what you changed. For example, "Fixed broken link."
2. Use the Present Tense: Your message should present tense rather than past tense. Avoid phrases like "I fixed something yesterday," because they leave no clue about what actually happened today. Instead, write in the present moment and describe what actually happened.
3. Limit First Line Length: Keep your first line under 72 characters to keep things readable on smaller screens. The second line and beyond can be wrapped onto additional lines.
4. Include Details in Second Lines: Add relevant detail in subsequent lines, separating subjects from bodies with blank lines. You don't want unnecessary context to confuse someone trying to understand what you did.
5. Provide Reproducible Information: Make sure to include enough information to recreate your issue or revert your commit if needed. Include command line arguments, platform versions, file paths, database states, etc.

### Test Automation
Test automation is a critical component in ensuring that the application undergoes rigorous testing to avoid bugs and unexpected behavior. There are several levels of testing that organizations can implement:

1. Unit Testing: This level includes testing individual components of an application to verify that they behave as expected. Typically, unit tests do not depend on external resources or data, allowing them to be executed quickly and unobtrusively. 
2. Integration Testing: Integration testing combines units tested separately into larger, more complex scenarios. Integration tests typically rely on mock objects or stubs to simulate real world scenarios.
3. Functional Testing: Functional testing covers the interaction between the user interface, backend services, and databases. Functional testing involves simulating user actions and checking whether the output matches the expectations.
4. Regression Testing: Regression testing evaluates the system after changes have been made to detect any unintended consequences. The goal is to restore the system to its original state and confirm that nothing has gone wrong. 

### Deployment Environments
Deployment environments refer to the places where our application gets hosted and runs. Before a release is shipped to a particular environment, it goes through several phases of testing, validation, and hardening. The following are the major factors to consider when deciding on a deployment environment:

1. Geographic Location: Latency and bandwidth limitations can impact the choice of location for deployment. Consider placing your application in the nearest regional data center for maximum performance and minimizing network latency. 
2. Hardware Architecture: Some environments may only offer limited hardware resources, such as memory or CPU limits. Plan accordingly to ensure optimal performance and capacity utilization.
3. Operating System: Choose a lightweight operating system like Linux or Windows for reduced resource consumption and enhanced security. 
4. Network Topology: Deploying your application across a wide area network (WAN) can significantly increase the likelihood of failures and outages. Ensure that your network topology is optimized for efficient transmission of data.

### Monitoring and Logging
Monitoring and logging are critical for measuring the health and activity of our application. Without accurate visibility into the health status of our app, we cannot identify and mitigate any issues that arise. Common activities performed by monitoring and logging tools include collecting logs, analyzing trends, and alerting on abnormal activity. The following are some best practices for monitoring and logging:

1. Use Standard Formatting: Log files must be formatted according to a consistent standard to enable ease of analysis and processing. Common formats include JSON, XML, plain text, or CSV.
2. Monitor Resource Usage: Track server resources like CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and network throughput to monitor for bottlenecks and overload situations. Set alerts to notify administrators if resource usage exceeds defined thresholds.
3. Identify Application Performance Anomalies: Periodically check system performance indicators such as response times, error rates, and transaction volumes to detect any performance anomalies that may need investigation. Configure dashboards and reports to visualize performance data.
4. Log Exceptions and Warnings: Catch exceptions and warnings thrown by the application and log them for future reference. Alert on errors and send notifications to relevant parties.
5. Record Permanent Events: Capture important events that occur regularly, such as billing cycles or inventory updates, and log them permanently to enable auditing and forensics purposes. Store event history for a period of time to protect against loss or modification.
