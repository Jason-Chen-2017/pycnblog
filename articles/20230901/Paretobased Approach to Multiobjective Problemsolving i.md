Social influence maximization (SIM) is one of the most important problems in social networks analysis and mining. Given a set of actors (nodes or users), their attributes such as network roles, behavioral patterns, expertise level etc., SIM aims to identify the key players or influencers that can affect many other nodes with different behaviors or outcomes by tapping into the collective intelligence or emotions of these actors. This problem is typically modeled as multi-objective optimization where multiple objectives are considered simultaneously and each objective has its own performance measure associated with it. The common practice is to use pareto-based approach which consists of identifying trade-offs between the various objectives. However, since there are multiple alternatives for any individual actor based on his/her network roles, attributes and expertise levels, this simple model may not capture all the complex relationships involved in SIM. Moreover, when dealing with dynamic social networks, evolving opinions about individuals over time, new approaches are required to adapt to the changes in the network topology and dynamics of interactions. Therefore, in this article, we will propose an alternative approach called as Pareto Graphs based influence maximization (PGIM). 

In PGIM, instead of simply trying to identify dominant strategies behind the success or failure of individuals, we aim to develop a comprehensive understanding of the underlying multifactorial relationship among actors across different contexts and environments. We formulate this task using graph theory concepts known as social graphs, which provide us a systematic way of representing information and actors' interconnections. Specifically, we represent actors as vertices in a social graph and define edge weights based on the strength of influence between them. By analyzing and exploring the structure of the social graph, we gain insights into how actors interact and collaborate together. Based on these insights, we then design algorithms and models that help identify the critical actors in the network who can have significant impact on future decisions made by others. Furthermore, we explore ways to update our social graph and interaction pattern based on the latest research findings and prior observations to anticipate sudden changes in the network and adapt accordingly. Overall, through our study, we hope to advance the state-of-the-art in understanding the complex relationships between actors in real world social systems and create more effective decision making tools and policies based on better understanding of their preferences, behaviors and potential outcomes. 

The rest of the paper will follow below steps:

1. Background Introduction: Describe what is Social influence maximization and why is it so important? Also explain briefly the definition of Pareto Graphs based influence maximization. 

2. Basic Concepts and Terminologies: Provide a clear explanation of basic terminology related to social networks including actors, edges, properties, roles, importance, and strategy. Showcase some examples from existing literature alongside PGIM. 

3. Core Algorithm and Operations: Dive deep into details of the core algorithm used in PGIM - how does it generate social graphs, identify critical actors, analyze social connections and how do they relate to properties and roles of actors. Briefly discuss mathematical formulations.

4. Practical Examples and Code Explanation: Using real life datasets, demonstrate PGIM on both synthetic and real world data sets. Discuss the limitations and benefits of the proposed method compared to traditional methods like clustering or centrality measures. Include detailed code implementation in Python and provide explanations for each step.

5. Future Directions and Challenges: Look forward towards possible applications of PGIM in healthcare, economics, finance, politics, law enforcement, security, transportation, social media analytics, recommendation systems, public policy, and other fields. Briefly list the prospective challenges faced by current methods and suggest promising directions for future work.

6. Conclusion: Summarize the main contributions of the paper and present practical implications for industry, society, and governments.
