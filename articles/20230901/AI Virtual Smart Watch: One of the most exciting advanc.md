One of the most exciting advancements in VR technological advancement lately is the arrival of AI-powered smart watches. These devices are not only able to recognise the users' intention but also have an understanding of how humans interact with digital worlds through speech or facial expressions. For instance, it can understand that a customer is looking for a product on the store's website by asking them questions like "Where would you like to buy this item?" or "Can I get a delivery estimate?". They will then deliver the products or provide the estimated time depending on what the customer needs. Similarly, they can interact with customers via text messages and voice assistants during online shopping experiences. Today, there are many technology companies working towards creating this type of application, including Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics, Google Inc., Fitbit, Amazon, Microsoft Corporation, among others. Despite their immense potential, some people may find it difficult to carry such devices around, especially if they don't have access to Wi-Fi connectivity all the time. To overcome this issue, a new class of smartphone design called AIoT (Artificial Intelligence-Enabled IoT) has been proposed which includes a combination of sensors, actuators, and embedded artificial intelligence modules. This device allows the owner to experience AI-enabled services through their smartphones while maintaining the privacy and security of personal data. However, researchers still need to explore the possibilities of using these types of devices as powerful assistants to improve human interaction with machines and applications.

Virtual Reality (VR) technologies have become increasingly popular due to its ability to simulate real environments in virtual space. VR applications range from entertainment, education, healthcare, and transportation to gaming and simulation. In recent years, advanced algorithms have been developed to create virtual characters that mimic realistic human behavior and actions. There is also an emerging market for developing more creative VR applications using Artificial Intelligence (AI). One example is GPT-3, which uses deep learning techniques to develop a machine learning model capable of generating thousands of possible texts based on prompts provided by the users. The generated texts usually sound very similar to human conversations and sentences, making it easy for users to identify patterns and meaning behind them. Another promising area of research is building AR/VR interfaces that incorporate computer vision and machine learning algorithms. By analyzing images captured by the camera feed, systems can identify objects and predict human behaviors. With the development of advanced mobile computing hardware, efficient processing power, and the advent of cloud computing, it is now feasible to deploy complex machine learning models at the edge, enabling real-time processing of high-resolution video streams. 

The concept of combining VR with AI-powered smart watches was pioneered by NVIDIA Corporation. The company has launched their AIR Lab, a startup hub that enables developers to prototype and test their ideas for virtual reality applications utilizing AI technology. The first iteration of the AIR Lab offers two prototypes - the NanoWatch, which imitates the functionality of Apple Watch and communicates with the user using a mini display, and the CubeWatch, which allows the user to control a virtual environment using gestures and voice commands. Both prototypes offer enhanced user experience compared to traditional VR applications and make use of powerful AI algorithms for object recognition, natural language understanding, and gesture recognition.

In conclusion, there are several reasons why AI virtual smart watch devices are becoming increasingly popular. Firstly, they enable users to interact with applications and machines using natural language without needing to leave their homes or workspaces. Secondly, they help improve social interactions, productivity, and cultural awareness, leading to improved well-being. Thirdly, they allow individuals to enjoy unprecedented virtual reality experiences, empowering them to live life in the moment. Finally, they can even serve as therapeutic tools for patients who suffer from epileptic seizures. Nevertheless, it is crucial to address concerns regarding the ethical implications of such devices, particularly when used by caregivers or parents, and to ensure that they do not lead to health risks or bias in decision-making processes.
