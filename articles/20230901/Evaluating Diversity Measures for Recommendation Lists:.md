Recommender systems are a powerful tool used in many e-commerce platforms to provide personalized recommendations based on the user's behavior or preferences. However, they can be biased and can lead to unfair decision making among users by presenting similar products as recommended items. This creates a negative impact on customer experience and satisfaction of the platform. To address this issue, various diversity measures have been proposed over the years that aim at evaluating the recommendation list such that it contains diverse products from different categories. In this article, we will explore several popular diversity measures such as Gini index, Cosine similarity, Jaccard distance, Spearman correlation coefficient, etc., to evaluate their performance and find out which one is suitable for practical use. We will also survey several state-of-the-art algorithms for computing these diversity measures. Finally, we will propose future research directions based on our findings.<|im_sep|>

## 2.1 Recommender Systems(推荐系统)
Recommender systems (RSs) are software tools that recommend products or services to users based on their past purchase history, ratings, tastes, and preferences. The goal of recommender systems is to suggest relevant items to the users while ensuring that each item is informative, engaging, and useful. RSs typically work using collaborative filtering technique where users’ past behaviors, actions, and evaluations are analyzed to determine what other items they may want to see. They rely heavily on machine learning techniques to learn patterns and preferences from large datasets collected from various sources like online reviews, social media, transaction data, and product information. A common scenario for recommender system development is when new products or services are released. In this case, new features must be added to the model so that it can accurately predict the user’s preference towards them. Additionally, there are many types of recommendation algorithms like content-based, collaborative filtering, and hybrid methods.

In general, recommender systems produce accurate results but there could still be some bias issues due to incomplete user profiles, inconsistent user behavior, and noisy feedback. Therefore, it becomes necessary to measure and evaluate the diversity of the recommendation lists generated by RSs to ensure fairness. 

## 2.2 Diversity Measures for Recommendation Lists
Diversity refers to an aspect of individual differences within groups. It is essential in any complex environment where multiple factors affect the decision-making process. While diversity measures focus on measuring the degree of dissimilarity between members of a group, diversity evaluation for recommendation lists involves more than just identifying individuals who share similar taste and preferences. For example, diversity measurements include the following metrics:

1. Coverage: It quantifies how representative the recommendation list is of all possible recommendations available to the user. The coverage metric considers both the number and diversity of items in the recommendation list.

2. Novelty: It measures whether the recommendations in the list are novel compared to those already consumed by the user before. Items with low novelty scores might not appeal to new consumers or they could even become irrelevant in the context of user preferences after repeated consumption.

3. Serendipity: It evaluates the likelihood that additional recommendations beyond the top ranked ones would elicit positive interaction. Thus, serendipity helps identify unexpectedly interesting items that otherwise might go unnoticed.

4. Diversity: It measures the extent to which the recommendations cover a wide range of topics and interests instead of being limited to a few dominant interests or topic areas. It requires analyzing the latent relationships between users' preferences and finds overlapping clusters of items that satisfy different criteria, including affinity, attraction, familiarity, similitude, and diversification. 

5. Credibility: It measures the reputation of the recommender algorithm and its ability to recommend trustworthy items given the user profile, historical data, and long-term behavior changes. It takes into account potential biases arising from assumptions made about user preferences and gives insight into the quality of the recommendation.

## 2.3 Popular Diversity Metrics 
The most commonly used diversity metrics in practice are as follows:

1. Gini Index: One way to measure diversity is through the Gini index, which calculates the area under the curve of the cumulative distribution function (CDF). If two sets of items have very high similarity, then their CDF values should be close to zero since they overlap significantly in terms of preferences. Hence, if two sets of items have very low similarity, their CDF values should approach infinity. The formula for calculating the Gini index is as follows:
   $$G=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}L_{i}$$ 
   where L is the summation of i=1 to n of (abs(pi - pj)), pi is the preference score assigned to item i, and pj is the average preference score across all items. 
   
   Generally speaking, the higher the value of G, the greater the level of dissimilarity between the items.
   
2. Cosine Similarity: Another popular method to calculate the cosine similarity between two vectors is to normalize them first and multiply them element-wise. The result is then taken to the power of 0.5. The larger the value, the closer the two vectors are related to each other. Specifically, the cosine similarity between two vectors x and y is calculated as follows: 
   $$\text{cos}(x, y)=\frac{\left\langle x, y \right\rangle}{\left\Vert x \right\Vert}_2 \times \frac{\left\langle x, y \right\rangle}{\left\Vert y \right\Vert}_2$$   
    
3. Jaccard Distance: This is another measure of distance between two sets of items. It is defined as the ratio of the size of the intersection set divided by the size of the union set. The higher the value, the less alike the sets are to each other. The Jaccard distance between two sets X and Y is calculated as follows:  
    $${\displaystyle d_{\mathrm {J}}(X,Y)=\frac{|X \cap Y|}{|X \cup Y|}={\frac {|X-Y|}{|X| + |Y|-|X \cap Y|}}}$$ 
    
4. Spearman Correlation Coefficient: This is a nonparametric measure of similarity between two sets of items. It assumes that the relationship between preferences of pairs of items does not follow a linear pattern. Instead, it models the similarity between pairs of items as a monotonic function of their ranks. If the two sets are highly similar, their correlation coefficients should increase together, indicating that the items occur in similar orders in both sets. Conversely, if they are highly dissimilar, their correlation coefficients should decrease jointly, indicating that the items do not occur in similar orders in either set. The formula for calculating the spearman correlation coefficient is as follows:   
    $$r = \frac{cov(x, y)}{\sigma_{x}\sigma_{y}}$$    
    Where cov() denotes the covariance between two variables, $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of a variable, r is the correlation coefficient, and x and y are the two sets of items.
    
Additionally, other popular metrics include Hellinger Distance, Kullback-Leibler Divergence, and Earth Mover's Distance. All these metrics have their own advantages and drawbacks depending on the type of data involved. Selecting the appropriate metric depends on the nature of your problem domain and intended use case.

## 2.4 Evaluation Criteria
To select an appropriate diversity metric for evaluating a recommendation list, you need to consider three main criteria:

1. Speed: How fast should the computation take? More precisely, how much time and memory resources do you need to compute the metric efficiently?

2. Accuracy: What level of accuracy is needed to distinguish good recommendations from bad ones? Are imperfect recommendations better than none at all?

3. Scalability: Does the diversity measurement scale well with the size of the dataset? Do you need to use distributed computing techniques or approximate methods to handle large datasets?
