# 1.简介
  

Industrial quality control (IQC) is an essential process for improving the safety and quality of industrial products, processes or services. It involves continuous monitoring over time to detect any deviations from established standards that could potentially cause harm to consumers. In this article, we will focus on applying semi-supervised learning techniques to IQC problems by utilizing historical data with labeled examples and unlabeled examples without labels. We will discuss about basic concepts such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and semi-supervised learning, algorithms used in semi-supervised learning including label propagation and self training, how they work, their advantages and limitations, and finally a real example of using these algorithms to improve the performance of an IQC system. The end result would be a comprehensive review paper highlighting the merits and challenges of applying semi-supervised learning techniques in IQC and guidance for future researchers.

## 2.1 Supervised Learning
Supervised learning refers to a type of machine learning where both input and output values are provided. For instance, when we train a model to classify images into different categories like animals, birds, flowers etc., the input image along with its corresponding category label is given at each iteration to update the parameters of the classifier. These labeled datasets are called "training sets". The goal of supervised learning is to learn a function that can map inputs to outputs based on prior knowledge of correct output results. An example of a simple classification problem is recognizing handwritten digits, which has been studied extensively since the early days of machine learning. Here is one way to represent the problem:

Input Image → Classifier(Image, Label) → Output Category 

In this case, the input is an image of a digit and the desired output is the class it belongs to (for instance, whether it's a zero, one, two, three etc.). At each iteration, the algorithm adjusts its internal weights to minimize the error between predicted and actual outputs. This process continues until the accuracy of the classifier increases beyond some predefined threshold. The final step is to evaluate the trained model using test data.

## 2.2 Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is a form of machine learning where only input values are provided but no associated outputs exist. Instead, the algorithm learns patterns and relationships in the data without any human intervention. One common application of unsupervised learning is clustering, where the algorithm identifies similarities among data points and groups them together based on certain criteria. Another popular use case is dimensionality reduction, where the algorithm reduces the number of dimensions in high-dimensional data while preserving most of the information. Here is an illustration of the concept:

Input Data → Clustering Algorithm → Clusters 

In this case, the input data may contain many features representing different aspects of objects, such as color, shape, size etc. After running through the clustering algorithm, similar clusters are grouped together based on similarity measures such as Euclidean distance or correlation coefficient. The resulting grouping becomes a new feature space that represents the original data in fewer dimensions than before.

## 2.3 Semi-Supervised Learning
Semi-supervised learning is a hybrid approach combining the strengths of supervised and unsupervised learning methods. The idea behind semi-supervised learning is to leverage the benefits of both approaches while making appropriate tradeoffs. A typical scenario in semi-supervised learning is to have a large amount of unlabeled data available and also provide a small subset of labeled examples. The key challenge in this setup is to effectively utilize all the available resources to obtain accurate predictions. The goal is not to achieve perfect accuracy because there is always noise in the data and errors will occur. However, by incorporating some level of supervision, we can reduce the overall error rate and maintain a good balance between labeled and unlabeled data. Here is an illustration of the concept:

Labeled Data + Unlabeled Data → Training Model → Predicted Outputs 

In this scenario, we first train our model on a combination of labeled and unlabeled data. During the training phase, the model uses both labeled and unlabeled data to make predictions. This helps us to reduce the bias towards the majority class and ensure consistent predictions across different samples.

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解
To apply semi-supervised learning techniques to IQC problems, we need to follow several steps:

1. Define the objective function - We need to define a metric to measure the quality of the model after training. There are various metrics commonly used in semi-supervised learning, such as cross entropy loss, mean squared error, F1 score, precision, recall, and area under curve (AUC). 

2. Select the base learner - The choice of base learner plays a crucial role in the success of semi-supervised learning. Common choices include neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, k-means clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA).

3. Train the base learner with labeled data - Since we have already collected labeled examples, we can directly train the base learner on this dataset. Note that we don't use the entire dataset during training, instead we randomly select a subset of labeled examples to train the base learner. We expect this to improve the performance due to lesser dependency on the unlabeled data. Also, note that we may want to perform augmentation or other preprocessing operations to increase the diversity of the training set.

4. Use active learning to select unlabeled data - Once the base learner is trained, we can use active learning to select a smaller subset of unlabeled examples for further training. Active learning consists of iteratively querying the user to provide feedback on which examples should be labeled next. The goal here is to maximize the benefit of our labeled and unlabeled data by selecting informative and representative examples.

5. Train the updated model on selected unlabeled data - Once we have selected a sufficiently small set of unlabeled examples, we can proceed with training the updated model on this subset. The same preprocessing operations that were performed during training of the base learner must also be applied to the newly selected unlabeled examples.

6. Evaluate the performance of the updated model - Finally, we need to evaluate the performance of the updated model on both labeled and unlabeled data to compare its effectiveness against the baseline. If necessary, we can fine-tune the hyperparameters of the models to optimize the performance further.

## 3.1 Label Propagation Algorithm
Label propagation is a well-known method for semi-supervised learning that was originally developed for text classification tasks. Given a fully labeled dataset consisting of labeled instances and partially labeled instances, the goal of label propagation is to propagate the labels from known instances to unlabeled instances according to the structure of the graph underlying the data. Mathematically, label propagation works as follows:

Label = f(Neighborhood), Neighborhood = Instances with Same Labels

Here, the label of an instance i is propagated to its neighbors j if they share the same label k. In order to implement label propagation, we need to construct a graph representation of the data, where nodes correspond to instances and edges connect instances that share a label. Then, we can repeatedly run a shortest path algorithm starting from each unlabeled instance to propagate its label to neighboring labeled instances. This ensures that the algorithm converges to a steady state where all instances are either labeled or part of a neighborhood where propagation is possible.

The main advantage of label propagation is that it requires minimal assumptions about the relationship between pairs of instances, as long as they share a label. On the other hand, label propagation suffers from a drawback that it tends to assign labels inconsistently. Specifically, if a node has multiple neighbors sharing the same label, then it may take on more than one distinct label depending on the ordering of iterations. Additionally, label propagation does not handle missing values very well, as it assigns default labels to those instances. To address these issues, variants of label propagation have been proposed that introduce additional constraints or penalties to prevent the propagation of incorrect labels. Examples of these variations include spectral clustering, KNN based label propagation, and relaxed label propagation. All of these methods attempt to balance the accuracy of the model with the intrinsic complexity of the problem. 

## 3.2 Self Training Algorithm
Self training is another technique that combines semi-supervised learning with active learning. In contrast to traditional active learning, where users are queried to label a specific subset of unlabeled examples, in self training, the algorithm itself chooses what examples to query. The core idea behind self training is to treat the unlabeled data as pseudo-labels produced by a separate model that is trained on the combined labeled and unlabeled data so far. The resulting probabilities generated by the self-trained model are fed back into the uncertainty sampling strategy of the active learning algorithm. Overall, the goal is to iteratively refine the labeled and unlabeled data by building strong models on top of weak predictors and enabling the exploration of regions where models fail. While theoretically sound, self training faces practical challenges related to computational efficiency, scalability, and privacy concerns. Currently, the best performing variant of self training is soft-label propagation (SLP), which introduces a penalty term on the confidence scores assigned by the self-trained model to favor consistency rather than accuracy. Nevertheless, SLP still leaves open the question of how much of a penalty to choose and what factors might affect the selection of the penalty value. Therefore, future directions in self training may involve developing adaptive strategies for setting the penalty term based on current performance and proposing novel mechanisms for ensuring privacy and fairness of the model outcomes. 

# 4.具体代码实例和解释说明
One real-world example of using semi-supervised learning techniques to IQC is described below. Consider an IQC system that monitors the movement of heavy machinery in a factory environment. We have recorded video footage of movements made by the machinery and annotated them manually to indicate areas of concern, such as contaminants, puncture marks, and obstructions. Our task is to build an AI system that can automatically detect and flag these suspicious events in real-time.

First, we collect a large amount of labeled data consisting of videos of normal movements and marked regions of interest (ROIs). We assume that each ROI corresponds to exactly one of five classes: contamination, puncture mark, obstruction, unknown, or background. For example, we might have around 10,000 frames of labeled data containing 500 contaminated, 300 punctured, 200 blocked, 1000 background, and 100 unknown frames per minute. Of course, this quantity is dependent on the particular deployment conditions and the severity of the disturbances being monitored.

Next, we collect a significant portion of unlabeled data consisting of videos of machinery movements that did not meet the quality standard defined by the initial labeled data. We randomly sample these movements to create a pool of unlabeled examples. Using these unlabeled examples, we can employ several techniques, including semi-supervised learning, to enhance the robustness and accuracy of our detector.

We start by implementing the base learner of our detection system, such as convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks, with the help of transfer learning. Transfer learning enables us to leverage pre-existing deep neural network architectures that have been trained on large datasets to solve a new task. Here, we can adapt a pre-trained CNN architecture such as VGG16 or ResNet and freeze its bottom layers, allowing us to easily finetune it on our specific task of object recognition. Next, we train the model on our labeled data using a binary cross-entropy loss function and Adam optimizer. We repeat this process on additional labeled batches of data until convergence occurs.

Once we have trained our base learner, we move on to the active learning stage. We initialize our active learning algorithm, such as uncertainty sampling or margin sampling, and randomly sample a batch of unlabeled examples. We feed these examples to the trained base learner to generate predictions. We sort these predictions in descending order of probability to identify the ones that correspond to the most uncertain examples. We present these candidates to the user for manual annotation, indicating whether each candidate meets our quality requirements and indicates any relevant artifacts. Based on the user's feedback, we adjust the distribution of probabilistic predictions to prioritize important cases for closer inspection. We continue this process until we have reached a specified budget of labeled data.

Finally, once we have completed the active learning cycle, we train our updated model on the selected unlabeled data using the same base learner architecture as before. We also use a logistic regression layer on top of the last few layers of the pretrained CNN architecture to produce binary predictions for each frame. We experiment with different regularization techniques such as dropout and weight decay to promote generalization and reduce overfitting. Lastly, we evaluate the performance of our detector using various metrics such as true positive rate, false alarm rate, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC. We hope that this real-world example highlights the potential of applying semi-supervised learning techniques to IQC applications, especially for complex real-world scenarios where annotating data is expensive or difficult.
