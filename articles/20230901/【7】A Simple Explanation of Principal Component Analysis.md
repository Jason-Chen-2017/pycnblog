# 1.简介
  

Principal component analysis (PCA), also known as empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), is a statistical procedure that uses an orthonormal basis set to transform a multivariate dataset into a set of uncorrelated variables called principal components. It helps in reducing the dimensionality of the original data by finding directions of maximum variance within it and expressing the observed data points in these new coordinates system. It is widely used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning applications such as pattern recognition, image compression, gene clustering, etc. In this article, we will learn about PCA algorithm from scratch using Python programming language.<|im_sep|>

# 2.背景介绍
PCA is a popular linear dimensionality reduction technique used for various purposes ranging from pattern recognition, image processing, bioinformatics, finance, and more. The main goal behind PCA is to identify patterns among a large number of variables in order to extract most informative features that explain the majority of the variance in the data. Once identified, principal components can be used for further tasks like classification, regression, outlier detection, and visualization.

In simple terms, PCA attempts to find the direction along which there exists the largest variation in a dataset and projects the data onto this axis while discarding all other dimensions. We can consider each observation as a point in a high-dimensional space where each feature represents one dimension. But often not all dimensions carry equal importance towards explaining the total variance present in the data. Therefore, PCA aims to reduce the number of dimensions required to represent the observations without losing much information.

The basic idea behind PCA involves calculating eigenvectors and eigenvalues of covariance matrix of the input data. These eigenvectors are ordered according to their corresponding eigenvalues in decreasing order. Eigenvectors associated with higher eigenvalues capture most of the variability in the data, whereas those associated with lower eigenvalues account for relatively lesser contribution. Hence, the first few principal components may contain most of the essential information regarding the structure of the data. 

Let's take a look at a graphical representation of how PCA works:

Here, X is our input dataset containing n observations of d-dimensions. Firstly, we calculate the mean vector of the entire dataset, x̄. Then, we subtract x̄ from every observation of X, obtaining centered matrix X′. Next, we compute the covariance matrix Cov(X′). This matrix contains the covariances between pairs of centered vectors obtained after taking transpose of X′. Finally, we obtain the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of Cov(X′) via diagonalization. We sort the eigenvectors based on the corresponding eigenvalues in descending order and select k eigenvectors corresponding to the top k principal components.

Once we have computed the k principal components, we can use them to project the original data onto a reduced dimensional subspace spanned by these k eigenvectors. Here’s a brief explanation of what happens when we do this projection:

1. Compute the projection of each observation xᵢ onto the selected k principal components.
2. Average the resulting k vectors to obtain a single vector representing the reduced-dimensionality observation x̃i = (x₁i,..., xₘi)^T.
3. Repeat step 1 & 2 for all n observations to form the transformed dataset Y = {y₁,..., yn}.

We can now visualize the original data X and its corresponding reduced-dimensionality version Y using different techniques such as t-SNE, UMAP, and so on.

Now let’s go through the core steps involved in performing PCA using Python. Note that this tutorial assumes you already know some basics of linear algebra, statistics, and Python programming. If not, I would suggest reading up on these topics before proceeding ahead with the code. 

1. Calculate the Mean Vector - To perform PCA, we need to first center the data around its mean vector, denoted as x̄. We can calculate the mean vector by adding all the observations and then dividing the result by the total number of observations. Mathematically, we have: 
      
    ```python
    mean = np.mean(X, axis=0) # Axis 0 refers to columns 
    ```
  
2. Subtract the Mean Vector from Data Matrix - Now, we need to subtract the calculated mean vector from each observation in the data matrix. Mathematically, we have: 
  
    ```python
    X = X - mean
    ```
    
3. Compute Covariance Matrix - After removing the mean value from the data matrix, we need to compute the covariance matrix, which captures the pairwise covariances between all variables in the data. We can use numpy library to compute the covariance matrix as follows:
    
    ```python
    cov_matrix = np.cov(X.T) # Using transpose since covariance matrix needs rows as variables instead of columns
    ```

4. Diagonalize the Covariance Matrix - Since the covariance matrix has many elements, diagonalizing it reduces it significantly. Eigendecomposition of a matrix gives us two matrices – a diagonal matrix consisting of the eigenvalues and another matrix consisting of the eigenvectors. We can use numpy library to diagonalize the covariance matrix as follows:
    
    ```python
    eig_vals, eig_vecs = np.linalg.eig(cov_matrix)
    ```
   
5. Sort Eigenvectors According to Eigenvalue Decomposition - The eigenvectors associated with larger eigenvalues capture more of the variance in the data than the eigenvectors associated with smaller eigenvalues. Thus, we want to choose only the top k eigenvectors that correspond to the top k principal components. One way to do this is to sort the eigenvectors based on their corresponding eigenvalues in descending order. We can use numpy library to sort the eigenvectors accordingly as follows:
    
    ```python
    idx = np.argsort(eig_vals)[::-1]    # returns indices that sort array in ascending order
    eig_vals = eig_vals[idx]              # sorting eig values
    eig_vecs = eig_vecs[:,idx]            # sorting eig vecs accordingly
    ```
    
6. Choose K Principal Components - We want to choose the eigenvectors that correspond to the top k principal components. For example, if k equals 2, we will choose the eigenvectors with the highest eigenvalues. We can achieve this by selecting the eigenvectors whose index falls below k in the sorted list of eigenvalues.
    
    ```python
    k = 2
    eig_pairs = [(np.abs(eig_vals[i]), eig_vecs[:,i]) for i in range(len(eig_vals))]   # creating list of tuples
    eig_pairs.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)                                       # sorting tuples based on first element
    w = np.hstack((eig_pairs[0][1].reshape(-1,1), eig_pairs[1][1].reshape(-1,1)))         # stacking top k eigvecs
    ```
    
After computing the k principal components, we can use them to transform the original data into a new space, which is equivalent to reducing the dimensionality of the original data. We can transform the data using the following formula:

    ```python
    Y = X @ w          # applying transformation
    ```
   
Finally, we can plot the transformed data using scatter plots and labels to see whether they seem reasonable or not. There are several ways to plot the transformed data but we will use matplotlib here.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.scatter(Y[:,0], Y[:,1], c=labels)      # plotting transformed data with labels
plt.show()                                  # showing graph
```


# 4.具体代码实例和解释说明

To better understand how PCA works, let’s apply it on a concrete example. Suppose we have a labeled dataset of handwritten digits, which consists of 64 pixels per image. Our task is to classify the images into 10 classes using supervised learning methods. Let’s load the dataset and visualize it. 


```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import datasets
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

digits = datasets.load_digits()                 # loading the digit dataset
X = digits.data                                 # extracting pixel values
labels = digits.target                          # extracting labels
N, D = X.shape                                  # getting shape of dataset
print("Number of samples:", N, "\tDimensionality:", D)     # printing details

fig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=5, figsize=(8,3))           # visualizing data
for i, axi in enumerate(ax.flat):
    img = X[i].reshape(8, 8)                    # reshaping data into 8x8 grid
    axi.imshow(img, cmap='gray')
    axi.set(title=str(labels[i]))
plt.show()                                              # showing graph
```

Output: Number of samples: 1797 Dimensionality: 64<|im_sep|>
