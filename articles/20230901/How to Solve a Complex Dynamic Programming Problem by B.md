Dynamic programming (DP) is one of the most important algorithms in computer science. It solves problems that can be solved using subproblems and optimal substructure properties. DP has several applications in optimization, sequencing, and game theory. In this article, we will learn about how to solve complex dynamic programming problems using backtracking algorithm. We are going to apply it on Levenshtein distance problem which is widely used in spell-checking software development. The Levenshtein distance between two strings is the minimum number of single character edits required to transform one string into another. This type of problems have many practical use cases like auto completion in search engines, image processing or speech recognition. Solving these types of problems with traditional methods such as memoization table and recursion may not give correct results. In contrast, backtracking can help us find an optimized solution for those problems.

In this article, we will go through each step involved in solving a complex dynamic programming problem using backtracking approach. Let's start!

Before diving into the detailed explanation, let’s quickly understand some commonly used terms and concepts related to dynamic programming:
1. Subproblem: A subproblem is a smaller version of the main problem whose solution depends only on solutions of its own subproblems. To solve any given problem, we first divide it into multiple subproblems, then solve them recursively and combine their solutions to obtain the final solution for the original problem.

2. Optimal substructure: If a problem exhibits optimal substructure property, i.e., if the optimal solution of the main problem depends only on the optimal solutions of its subproblems, then we can often solve the problem efficiently using dynamic programming. For example, the shortest path from source vertex to all other vertices of a graph follows this property. Given a list of numbers {a1, a2, …, ak}, where ai is the cost of visiting the ith city, the shortest tour starting at city i must include both cities immediately before and after itself along the shortest path. Therefore, there exists no shorter tour than the current one except when we choose to skip over either of the immediate neighboring cities. Hence, the best way to reach city j from city i is always one of {either visiting it directly or skipping over it}. Thus, if we know the optimal cost of reaching any particular city j, we can compute the optimal costs of all other cities in constant time by considering the three possibilities: staying at i, visiting j, or skipping over j. So, the optimal solution for the main problem (shortest tour starting from any city), requires knowledge of optimal solutions of subproblems - the optimal costs of reaching all other cities from every visited city.

3. Overlapping subproblems: Some dynamic programming problems involve overlapping subproblems, meaning that we need to solve multiple instances of the same subproblem instead of computing each instance separately. One common case is the knapsack problem, where we want to select items so that their total weight does not exceed a certain limit. To avoid duplicate computations, we store the solutions of previously computed subproblems in a cache data structure and reuse them whenever possible.

4. Memoization: Memoization is a technique of storing the result of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. Dynamic programming uses memoization extensively to reduce redundant computations and speed up the execution of algorithms.


Now that you have a basic understanding of what dynamic programming is and what it means, let’s move onto backtracking algorithm.

Backtracking is a generalized form of depth-first search that can also be applied to various NP-complete problems. Instead of exploring the entire search tree, backtracking allows us to explore parts of the state space that may lead to failure earlier without having to fully expand the search tree. Once we identify a partial solution that cannot lead to success, we backtrack and try new choices until we find a valid solution or eliminate some invalid ones altogether. Since it involves discarding paths that do not follow the directions implied by the constraints imposed during the search process, backtracking makes it particularly effective in solving large puzzles and optimization problems. 

The backtracking algorithm works by maintaining a set of states representing candidate solutions that have been explored but haven't been selected yet. At each iteration, the algorithm chooses a state and tests whether it satisfies the goal condition. If it doesn't, the algorithm undoes the last change made to the state and tries a different transition. If the chosen state satisfies the goal condition, the algorithm marks it as part of the solution and moves on to the next unexplored state. If the algorithm visits all unexplored states without finding a complete solution, it returns False indicating that there is no valid solution. The key idea behind backtracking is that by choosing only locally optimal transitions, we can prune away branches that do not contribute to the global optimum. By doing so, we can increase the probability of finding the globally optimal solution much faster compared to naive enumeration approaches.  

Let's now look at the steps involved in solving a complex dynamic programming problem using backtracking approach.
