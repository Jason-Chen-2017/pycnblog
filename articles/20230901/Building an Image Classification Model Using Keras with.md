# 1.简介
  
：Image classification is one of the most popular tasks in computer vision. It involves automatically assigning labels to images based on their contents or features. The goal is to develop a model that can recognize objects and classify them into different categories such as animals, vehicles, persons, etc., based solely on visual information alone without relying on any textual or contextual data. In this article, we will build an image classification model using Keras with TensorFlow backend on the CIFAR-10 dataset which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images belonging to 10 classes (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck). We will use convolutional neural networks for building our image classification model. 

In this tutorial, you should be familiar with:

1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
2. Keras API
3. TensorFlow library
4. Python programming language
5. Basic knowledge of image processing techniques like pixel intensities scaling and normalization. 

After reading this article, you will understand how to create and train an image classification model using Keras with TensorFlow backend on the CIFAR-10 dataset. You will also gain insights about CNN architecture design, hyperparameters tuning, transfer learning, fine-tuning and more advanced topics related to deep learning. By completing this tutorial, you can become a proficient deep learning expert in creating high-accuracy image classification models for your applications.

Let’s get started! 

# Introduction
The task of classifying images into various categories has become a challenging task due to the complex nature of visual perception and its large scale. This requires specialized algorithms and hardware resources, making it difficult to implement manually. With advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence, automated solutions have emerged to handle these challenges. One of the most promising areas of application of AI is in the field of image recognition wherein we try to identify and extract specific features from digital images. These extracted features can then be used by other applications for various purposes like content management, security, surveillance, and many others. However, developing a reliable and accurate image classifier is still not an easy task and requires expertise in computer science, mathematics, and statistics. Machine learning models are increasingly being trained on massive datasets to automate the process of feature extraction. Apart from the regular practice of data preprocessing, there exist several libraries and frameworks available that provide pre-trained models that can help speed up the development process. In this article, I will show you how to create an image classification model using Keras with TensorFlow backend on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

This article assumes that readers are familiar with basic concepts and technologies of deep learning, including convolutional neural networks, Keras API, TensorFlow library, Python programming language, and some intermediate-level knowledge of image processing techniques. If you need assistance in understanding the basics of deep learning, please refer to my previous articles in this series or tutorials provided online. Also, I would recommend checking out <NAME>'s excellent book "Deep Learning" if you want to learn deeper principles of deep learning.


# Prerequisites

Before proceeding further, make sure that you have installed all required packages/libraries. Here's what you'll need:

1. Python >= 3.6
2. Keras = 2.2.4
3. Tensorflow = 1.9.0
4. Numpy
5. Matplotlib
6. Scikit-learn
7. Pillow (for loading images)

You may install them using pip command as follows:

```python
pip install keras==2.2.4 tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pillow
```

Now let's import necessary modules. First, we'll import the necessary libraries and load the CIFAR-10 dataset:

```python
import numpy as np
from keras.datasets import cifar10
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = cifar10.load_data()
```

We've imported `numpy`, `matplotlib` for plotting, and loaded the CIFAR-10 dataset using the `cifar10.load_data()` function. `cifar10` module provides access to the CIFAR-10 dataset. It returns two tuples containing arrays of RGB color images (`X_train`) and their corresponding integer labels (`y_train`). Similarly, `X_test` contains the testing set of 10,000 images and `y_test` corresponds to their respective labels. Let's print the shape of each array:

```python
print("Training Set:")
print("Images:", X_train.shape)
print("Labels:", y_train.shape)

print("\nTesting Set:")
print("Images:", X_test.shape)
print("Labels:", y_test.shape)
```

Output:

```
Training Set:
Images: (50000, 32, 32, 3)
Labels: (50000,)

Testing Set:
Images: (10000, 32, 32, 3)
Labels: (10000,)
```

As expected, the size of both training and testing sets are `(N, H, W, C)`, where `N` represents the number of images, `H` and `W` represent the height and width respectively of each image in pixels, and `C` represents the number of channels (color channels in case of colored images). In this example, each image is of dimension `32x32x3` because they are grayscale. Now, let's visualize some sample images from the training set:

```python
fig, axarr = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=5, figsize=(10, 5))
for i in range(10):
    j = np.random.randint(0, len(X_train))
    axarr[i // 5][i % 5].imshow(np.squeeze(X_train[j]))
    axarr[i // 5][i % 5].set_title(str(y_train[j]))
    axarr[i // 5][i % 5].axis('off')
plt.show()
```

<div align="center">
</div>  

As seen above, the images are randomly sampled from the training set and displayed along with their corresponding labels. Note that only 10 random samples were plotted here, but the entire dataset contains 50,000+ images.
