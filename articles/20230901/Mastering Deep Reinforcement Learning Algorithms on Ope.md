# 1.简介
  

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning technique that enables agents to learn by trial and error from experience without being explicitly programmed. In recent years, RL has become one of the most active areas in artificial intelligence research as it offers many challenging tasks for AI systems such as game playing, robotics control, healthcare diagnosis, etc. Despite its immense potential, however, applying RL algorithms to real-world problems can be challenging due to various factors such as the complexity of the environment, the non-stationarity of the problem, and high dimensionality of states and actions. To address these challenges, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques have emerged which leverage powerful neural networks and exploration strategies to overcome the limitations of classical RL methods. 

In this article, we will focus on DRL algorithms based on deep Q-networks (DQN), a well-established model-free algorithm used extensively in solving complex decision making problems. We will also compare different implementations of DQN with popular open-source environments provided by OpenAI gym library. Finally, we will discuss how to improve the performance of DQN through prioritized replay buffer, noisy nets, distributed training, and target network update scheduling. This article assumes readers are familiar with basic concepts of RL, Python programming language, deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, and Linux command line interface.

# 3.关于Q-Learning与DQN
## Q-Learning算法
Q-learning (QL) is an off-policy temporal difference (TD) algorithm that learns state-action values based on temporal differences between current state and next state. It works by initializing a table of action values, then iteratively updating each entry in the table based on the temporal difference between actual reward achieved in response to each possible action taken given the current state, and the maximum estimated future discounted cumulative reward obtainable starting from the updated state and taking the same action. Mathematically, the formula for updating the action value function $Q(s_t,a_t)$ at time step t is:
$$\begin{align*}
Q_{t+1}(s_t,a_t) &= Q_t(s_t,a_t) + \alpha [r_t + \gamma max_{a} Q_t(s_{t+1},a) - Q_t(s_t,a_t)] \\
&\text{(where } r_t \text{ is the reward obtained after taking action } a_t \text{ in state } s_t)}\\
&\text{(and }\alpha\text{ is the learning rate)}\\
&\text{(and }\gamma\text{ is the discount factor)}\end{align*}$$
The QL algorithm repeatedly updates the action value estimates until convergence. Here's a pseudocode for the QL algorithm:

1. Initialize the Q-table with zeros for all state-action pairs $(s_i,a_j)$ where there are i total states and j total actions. Each row represents a state, while each column represents an action. For example, if we're working on a two-player grid world problem, we might have four states ($s_1 = (x=1,y=1)$, $s_2 = (x=2,y=1)$, $s_3 = (x=1,y=2)$, $s_4 = (x=2,y=2)$) and two actions (up and down). Then our Q-table could look like this:

   |    | up   | down|
   |:---|------|-----|
   |$s_1$|$q_1^u$|$q_1^d$|
   |$s_2$|$q_2^u$|$q_2^d$|
   |$s_3$|$q_3^u$|$q_3^d$|
   |$s_4$|$q_4^u$|$q_4^d$|

2. Choose an initial state $s_0$, an initial action $a_0$, and initialize a random exploration probability $\epsilon$.

3. Repeat forever:

   1. With probability $\epsilon$, take a random action $a_\text{rand}$ instead of choosing the best action according to the current estimate of the Q-function for $s_t$.
    
   2. Otherwise, take the action $a_t$ corresponding to the largest Q-value among all available actions for state $s_t$:

      $$a_t=\arg\max_{a}\left\{Q(s_t,a)\right\}$$
      
   3. Execute action $a_t$ in the environment, observe new state $s_{t+1}$, and receive immediate reward $r_{t+1}$.
   
   4. Update the Q-table by adding the TD error calculated as follows:
   
      $$\delta_t=r_{t+1}+\gamma \max_{a}Q\left(s_{t+1},a\right)-Q(s_t,a_t)$$
      
      and setting the new Q-value for $(s_t,a_t)$ equal to:
      
      $$Q(s_t,a_t)=Q(s_t,a_t)+\alpha\delta_t$$
      
   End for loop

4. When convergence is reached, terminate and return the learned Q-function $Q$.

This algorithm involves estimating the optimal action-state value function for any given state. However, it doesn't directly model the transition dynamics nor does it consider the possibility of stochastic transitions. As a result, it requires multiple iterations before converging to the true solution and often fails to find a good approximate solution even when given infinite time to train. Also, since the estimation method uses only the current knowledge, it can quickly drift away from the true underlying system, leading to suboptimal policies.

## Deep Q-Networks（DQN）算法
To solve these issues, Google DeepMind proposed Deep Q-Networks (DQN), a modification of the classic Q-Learning approach that incorporates deep neural networks into the algorithm. Instead of representing the Q-function as a lookup table, DQN replaces it with a parameterized approximation of the expected return. Specifically, it constructs a deep neural network called the "Q-network" that takes in a fixed length representation of the current state and returns the predicted Q-values for each available action. Unlike traditional tabular approaches, DQN explores more efficiently by incorporating both the past and present experiences into its updates. Moreover, the Q-network parameters are trained end-to-end using gradient descent to minimize the loss between predicted and observed Q-values. Overall, DQN achieves significant improvements over other Q-learning baselines, including its ability to handle large scale problems and its robustness against stochasticity and temporally correlated observations.

Here's a brief overview of the key components of the DQN algorithm:

1. **Experience replay**: DQN employs an experience replay memory to store previous interactions between the agent and the environment, allowing it to learn from unevenly sampled trajectories and encourage more efficient exploration. Experience replay provides an effective way of reducing correlation between samples in the training set, improving sample diversity and accelerating learning.

2. **Target network**: Since the Q-function is computed using samples from the latest episode, it becomes stale and less accurate as the agent interacts with the environment. Therefore, DQN maintains another copy of the Q-function called the "target network", which is periodically synced with the main network to keep them in sync with each other. During training, the target network is frozen to avoid unnecessary computation.

3. **Double Q-learning**: Double Q-learning addresses the issue of maximizing over both the current and next actions during training. Rather than selecting the action based solely on the estimated current action-state values, double Q-learning selects the best action from either the current or next Q-function depending on the value of a randomly chosen "bootstrap" action selected from the other Q-function. This improves stability and prevents the current Q-function from becoming too heavily biased towards certain actions that consistently yield high rewards but do not lead to much exploration.

4. **Prioritized experience replay**: Prioritized experience replay assigns higher priority to samples that contribute significantly to the accumulation of high-reward transitions during training, which reduces the likelihood of falling victim to slow progressive widening. Prioritized experience replay guarantees that important transitions are seen frequently relative to the rest, thus preventing the majority of samples from accumulating low priority in the event they don't carry much information about the optimal strategy.
