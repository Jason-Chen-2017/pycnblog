Cluster analysis or clustering is a data mining technique used to group similar objects into clusters based on certain parameters such as distance measures or similarity functions. In this article we will discuss about the most commonly used cluster algorithms with their basic concepts and mathematical formulas. We will also demonstrate some of the implementation of these algorithms using Python programming language. Finally, we will highlight future potential applications of clustering algorithms in different fields. This article will provide insights into how to use best-suited clustering algorithm for your dataset.

This article is targeted towards individuals who are interested in applying clustering techniques in various fields such as machine learning, pattern recognition, image processing etc., where large amounts of unstructured data can be analyzed and understood. By reading this article, you can get an overview of the popular clustering algorithms that exist today and select the appropriate one for your problem statement. Moreover, if you have any specific needs related to clustering such as customizing the distance function or adjusting hyperparameters, it is essential to understand the underlying mathematics behind each method before implementing them. Hence, this blog article provides a comprehensive guide to help you choose the right clustering algorithm for your dataset. 

# 2.Basic Concepts: Terminology & Formulation:
Before discussing the core algorithms, let’s first understand some important terminology and notation associated with clustering.

1. Data points (or instances): These are the individual items or entities that we want to categorize or group together. For example, in a market segmentation application, we may have multiple customers who share similar characteristics, so they would fall under the same category when segmented by clustering algorithm. 

2. Clusters: Once we have identified groups of data points, we call them “clusters” because they represent patterns within our dataset. Clusters contain similar data points which are grouped together based on some characteristic like proximity, density, cohesion, etc. 

3. Similarity measure or Distance Function: A measurement that tells us how close two data points are from each other. It takes values between zero and one, where closer data points have higher values. There are several ways to define similarity/distance function depending upon the requirements of the problem at hand. Some common similarity/distance functions include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, cosine similarity, correlation coefficient, etc.

4. Hyperparameters: These are constants that affect the performance of the clustering algorithm but are not learned during training phase. They usually involve the number of clusters required, initialization methods, optimization algorithms, etc. 

5. Model Selection Criteria: These criteria are used to evaluate the quality of clustering models and determine the optimal number of clusters. Common criteria include maximum silhouette width, minimum intra-cluster variance, and calinski-harabasz index.

We will now proceed to discuss each of the core clustering algorithms along with its own strengths, weaknesses, assumptions, and usage scenarios.

# 3. K-Means Algorithm:
K-means algorithm is one of the simplest and widely used clustering algorithms. It belongs to the centroid-based clustering technique where we first initialize k centroids randomly and then assign each data point to the nearest centroid until convergence. The key idea behind this algorithm is to find the centeroids of all the clusters and place them appropriately without overlapping. Here are the steps involved: 

1. Initialize ‘k’ Centroids: Randomly pick ‘k’ data points as initial centroids. One way to do this is to generate random indices for each data point and take the corresponding features as the coordinates of the centroid.  

2. Assign Data Points to Nearest Centroid: Calculate the euclidean distance between each data point and each centroid. Assign the data point to the closest centroid. 

3. Recalculate Centroid Position: Update the position of each centroid by taking the mean value of all data points assigned to it. If there are no changes in the positions of centroids after an iteration, stop the algorithm. 

4. Repeat Step 2 and 3 until convergence. 

Strengths of K-Means Algorithm: 

1. Easy to implement: K-Means is computationally easy to implement and runs quickly even on large datasets. 

2. No prior assumption about the shape of clusters: K-Means does not assume any particular shape of the clusters and can identify non-convex shapes too. 

3. Deterministic results: Since the assignment of data points to clusters is done deterministically, we know exactly what each data point will belong to once the algorithm converges. 

Weakness of K-Means Algorithm: 

1. Sensitive to initialization: Choosing the initial centroids can significantly impact the final result. Therefore, initializing with arbitrary centroids can lead to unexpected results. 

2. Cannot handle noise or outliers well: Outlier detection is difficult task in high dimensional spaces and affects the efficiency of K-Means algorithm. 

3. Not scalable: K-Means algorithm has cubic time complexity due to calculating distances between every pair of data points. As the dimensionality increases, the algorithm becomes slow and impractical.

Usage Scenario: 

K-Means clustering algorithm is commonly used in computer vision, pattern recognition, bioinformatics, and text analytics to cluster similar data points based on their features. When applied to images, it helps in detecting distinct regions or object boundaries. On the other hand, it is useful in clustering social media posts, web sessions, and financial transactions based on user behavior, preferences, content, etc. Its main limitation lies in its sensitivity to initialization and lack of scalability. However, it is often trained iteratively and tuned to achieve good results. 

Python Implementation: 

Here's a simple implementation of K-Means Algorithm using Scikit Learn library in Python. Let’s say we have a numpy array named X_train containing the feature vectors of our data set, and we want to cluster the data into two clusters using K=2. Then following code snippet shows how to apply K-Means algorithm and obtain the predicted labels:

``` python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans 
import numpy as np 

X = np.array(X_train) # input matrix 
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2).fit(X) # creating KMeans instance with K=2 
labels = kmeans.predict(X) # predicting cluster labels for input samples 
```

In the above code snippet, we created an instance of the KMeans class with K=2. We then called the fit() method of the KMeans instance passing the input matrix X to train the model. After training, we used the predict() method of the KMeans instance to obtain the predicted labels for each sample in X_train.
