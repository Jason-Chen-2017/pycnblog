> Chatbots are becoming increasingly popular with organizations such as Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc., and in recent years they have become very prevalent in customer service, e-commerce, healthcare, entertainment industry, and many other areas where human interactions are required. In this article we will create our own chatbot using Python and the Dialogflow API to interact with users via text or voice input and provide them with relevant information and services. We'll also use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to make our bot smarter by understanding their intentions and context of conversation. This article assumes that readers already know how to write basic programs in Python and some basics of NLP concepts like lexicons and syntactic parsing. 

This is an advanced article, which requires knowledge of both programming languages and technologies related to AI and natural language processing. Therefore, it may not be suitable for those who do not have these skills yet.

In this tutorial, we will create a simple weather chatbot that can give current weather conditions based on user's location or zip code. We will start by creating a new project on the Dialogflow website and setting up a virtual agent. Then, we will implement a weather API integration using OpenWeatherMap API. Finally, we will train our agent to recognize user inputs and return appropriate responses accordingly. 

By the end of this tutorial, you should understand:

 - How to build a chatbot using Dialogflow
 - How to integrate external APIs into your chatbot
 - How to design natural language interfaces for your chatbot
 - How to handle user queries using dialog management and fulfillment systems
# 2. Basic Concepts & Terminology
Before we get started, let’s go over some important terms and concepts that you need to be familiar with before we move forward. These include but are not limited to: 

 - **Dialogflow**: An online tool provided by Google that allows developers to easily create conversational assistants and chatbots. It offers tools for building bots and integrating different platforms and devices. 
 - **Intents**: Intents represent actions the user wants the assistant to perform. They help define what the user is looking for and what they want to achieve. 
 - **Fulfillment**: Fulfillment is the process by which the assistant responds to user requests. The response can be text or speech and can vary depending on the nature of the request. 
 - **Context**: Context represents the current state of the conversation and includes variables like previous utterances, system entities, and session parameters.  
 - **Session Parameters** : Session parameters are key-value pairs that can be used to store data across multiple turns of the conversation. You can set default values for session parameters when you configure your agent on the Dialogflow website. 
 - **Training Data**: Training data consists of examples of user inputs along with their corresponding expected responses, called intent training phrases. 
# 3. Algorithmic Principles & Steps 
Now that we have a basic idea of what a chatbot is and how it works, we can proceed with implementing one. Let's break down the steps involved in building a weather chatbot using Dialogflow:


 1. Create a New Project on Dialogflow Website
 2. Set Up Virtual Agent
 3. Integrate Weather API
 4. Design User Interface
 5. Train Bot
 6. Test Bot
 7. Publish Bot 


## Step 1: Creating a New Project on Dialogflow Website


## Step 2: Setting Up Virtual Agent

Next, we need to add a few things to our virtual agent. First, we need to enable the microphone button so that our chatbot can listen to the user. Second, we need to link our existing weather API to our agent. Lastly, we need to create an entity that represents the user's location or zipcode. To do so, follow the steps given below:

 1. Under the `Settings` tab, scroll down to `Google Assistant Settings` section and enable `Use Microphone Button`. 
 2. Go back to the main dashboard of your newly created agent and under the `Integrations` section select `APIs & Services` from the menu bar on the left side. Search for `OpenWeatherMap` and connect it to your agent.
 3. Next, under the same `Integrations` section, choose `Entities` from the menu bar. Choose `Add Entity`, enter a unique name like `Location_or_ZipCode` and select the option `Create List Entity`. Now, you can start adding items to your list. For example, you could add all US zip codes starting with digits less than 600. If the user types "90210" in your chatbot, it will extract the location as "San Francisco, CA". 

## Step 3: Integrating Weather API

The next step is to integrate our existing weather API, OpenWeatherMap, to our agent. Follow the steps given below:

 1. On the top right corner of your agent homepage, click on the gear icon and then `Export and Import`.
 2. Select the `Import From` option from the dropdown and browse to your cloned repository directory where you downloaded the source code files. Navigate to the `intents` folder and select the `weather.json` file. Drag and drop this file onto the browser window that appears. You will see a pop-up message saying that the file has been imported successfully.  
 3. Expand the `Actions` section on the left hand side navigation pane. Under `API.AI Webhooks`, copy the URL and paste it into the `Weather Intent Fulfillment` field on the right hand side panel. Make sure that the webhook URL points to the correct location where you deployed the backend server code earlier. 

## Step 4: Designing User Interface

To ensure that our chatbot provides accurate results, we need to think about its user interface. As an AI-powered chatbot, we cannot expect users to remember every command and interaction method, especially when there are so many options available. So, we need to design intuitive and easy-to-use UI elements. Below are a few suggestions for improving the UI:

 1. Use buttons instead of menus whenever possible to reduce cognitive load. Instead of typing commands like "show me today's weather", ask users to tap on a single button labeled "Get Weather Forecast." This makes it easier for users to quickly access the desired functionality without having to learn a complex syntax. 
 2. Provide clear feedback messages to indicate whether the requested action was completed successfully or not. When the user asks for a weather forecast, we should respond back within seconds with the latest updates and avoid providing confusing error messages. 
 3. Support multi-language capabilities for your chatbot. Your customers might communicate in multiple languages and it would be helpful if your chatbot can understand them too. Consider incorporating multilingual support using Cloud Translation API.  

## Step 5: Training Bot

Now, we need to teach our bot how to handle user inputs and provide appropriate responses. This involves writing intent training phrases and assigning them to specific intents. Here are the steps to train our weather chatbot:

 1. On the left hand side panel, expand the `Train` section and select `Intents` from the dropdown. Add a new intent named `Weather Intent`. This intent will capture the user's request for weather forecast. Underneath, enter two training phrases representing the most common ways a user might say something like "what is the weather?" or "can you tell me the weather?". Assign each phrase to the `Weather Intent`. For instance, assign `"What is the weather today"` to the first training phrase and `"Can you please tell me the weather forecast for Seattle"` to the second one. Remember that you can always edit or remove the training phrases later. 
 2. Move on to defining the response for the `Weather Intent`. Under the `Responses` section, click on `Add Response` and specify the output format of your choice. In our case, since we only require the temperature and condition, we can use plain text to display the result. Type `{Temperature} degrees and {Condition}` as the response template. Click on `Save` once done.   
 3. Next, under `Training Phrases` section, click on `+ Add Example`. Type a couple more test cases for this intent to verify that the chatbot is working correctly. For example, type in `Show me the weather for San Francisco` and check if the chatbot returns the temperature and condition accurately. Save and train the changes by clicking on the blue circle button located on the top right corner of the page. 

## Step 6: Testing Bot

Finally, we need to test our chatbot to validate that it is functioning properly. Here are the steps to test our weather chatbot:

 1. Switch to the `Test` tab on the left hand side navigation pane and enter a query like `What is the weather today?`. Verify that the chatbot responds with the weather report including the temperature and condition. 
 2. Also try entering different queries like "How's the weather?", "Will it rain tomorrow?", and others to further validate that the chatbot handles various scenarios. You can customize the list of supported features by modifying the training data and retraining the bot. 

## Step 7: Publishing Bot

Once the testing phase is complete, we can publish our chatbot so that it becomes available for real-world usage. Follow the steps given below to publish our chatbot:

 1. On the top right corner of your agent homepage, click on `Deploy` and then `Demo Mode`. 
 2. Copy the demo mode embed code and paste it somewhere where your frontend application can render it. Alternatively, you can share the URL directly with potential customers to test drive your chatbot without requiring them to download and install anything.
