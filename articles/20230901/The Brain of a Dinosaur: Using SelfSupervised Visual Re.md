Self-supervised visual representations are an increasingly popular approach for training deep neural networks without any labeled data, by using unsupervised learning techniques to learn the structure and semantics of images through self-supervision. However, these approaches often struggle with long-term dependencies in the sequential input spaces that are typical of natural language processing tasks such as machine translation or speech recognition. Here we present a new methodology for simulating recurrent neural networks using self-supervised visual representations called V-RNN. Our proposed architecture incorporates attention mechanisms into the decoder component of traditional RNNs, making it more suitable for handling long term dependencies among input sequences. We demonstrate its effectiveness on several tasks including image captioning, text to speech synthesis, and video prediction.

In this paper, we propose two variants of V-RNN which differ in their use of multi-head self-attention over the hidden states of each time step. The first variant uses a single head only and is referred to as vanilla V-RNN. In contrast, the second variant uses multiple heads to capture different patterns of correlation across the sequence length, and is named multi-head V-RNN. Experiments show that both variants achieve competitive performance when trained on large datasets like COCO Caption, ImageNet Captions, and MPII Human Pose, while outperforming conventional methods like LSTMs and Transformers. Additionally, our analysis reveals interesting insights about how individual components in V-RNN affect overall performance and illustrate why they can be effective for modeling complex long-term dependencies in sequential inputs.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been shown to perform well on various sequential input domains, ranging from natural language processing tasks like machine translation and speech recognition to audio-visual tasks like video classification and action recognition. These models are commonly implemented using either feedforward or feedback connections between layers, where output at each timestep is dependent on previous inputs. While there has been significant progress recently in developing self-supervised algorithms that can effectively extract meaningful features from raw data, most existing work focuses mainly on pretraining the model on large labeled datasets before fine-tuning on specific downstream tasks. 

One challenge faced by many researchers in this space is dealing with long-term dependencies in input sequences, particularly those that arise due to spatial or temporal relationships between consecutive elements in the sequence. Traditional RNN architectures typically do not explicitly take advantage of these dependencies, leading to degradation of performance due to the vanishing gradient problem during backpropagation. Despite recent advances in deep learning techniques like Transformers and Long Short-Term Memory units (LSTMs), it remains challenging to design efficient RNN models capable of capturing rich spatio-temporal dependencies in inputs.

Recent works have explored ways to train RNNs on self-supervised visual representations obtained through the use of convolutional networks. One promising direction is to adapt the Transformer architecture and use multi-headed self-attention to create a unified representation of all time steps in the input sequence. This approach enables the model to better leverage long-range correlations among sequential elements. However, experiments conducted so far on limited datasets, such as CIFAR-10 and ILSVRC-2012, show that the transformer based models do not significantly outperform LSTM baselines, indicating that further improvement is necessary before applying them to real-world problems.

We propose a novel architecture called Vanilla V-RNN, which provides an alternative solution to the limitation imposed by standard RNNs that cannot handle long-term dependencies in their input sequences. Our key insight is to add attention mechanisms into the decoding process of traditional RNNs, enabling the model to focus on relevant parts of the sequence while ignoring irrelevant information. To implement attention, we modify the basic idea behind Attention Is All You Need (AIY) introduced by Bahdanau et al., who discovered a mechanism by which models can attend to relevant regions of the input sequence to improve predictive accuracy. Specifically, we extend AIY's attention mechanism to consider multiple heads, allowing us to capture important patterns of correlation across the entire sequence. 

To simulate traditional RNNs using the same functional unit as V-RNN, we introduce a modification to the standard recurrence equation used by RNNs. Instead of computing the next state as a linear combination of current input and previous state, we compute the weighted sum of the input and previous state vectors using learned weights. By doing this, we implicitly encourage the network to focus on appropriate parts of the sequence, rather than being constrained to following the exact sequence order. 

Next, we derive the mathematical formulation of attention mechanisms using a simplified version of Bahdanau et al.'s attention formula, also known as "Scaled Dot-Product Attention". This formula allows us to measure the similarity between pairs of query and key vectors, and then weight the values accordingly before combining them into an output vector. We apply this formula to each element of the input sequence, producing a set of weighted values representing what parts of the sequence contribute most to each output. 

Finally, we combine the modified recurrence equation with attention mechanisms to build V-RNN, which includes a bidirectional encoder that processes the input sequence forwards and backwards, followed by a stack of fully connected layers applied to the final state vector to produce the final output probabilities. We evaluate V-RNN on three representative tasks - image captioning, text-to-speech synthesis, and video prediction - using large publicly available datasets like COCO Caption, MPII Human Pase, and ImageNet Captions. Our results indicate that V-RNN achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other models while still requiring minimal finetuning and demonstrating that it can indeed capture the rich spatio-temporal dependencies in input sequences.
