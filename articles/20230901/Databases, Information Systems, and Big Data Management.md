2. Background Introduction 
Big data is an emerging term that refers to enormous volumes of structured and unstructured data that have become digitally generated and collected every day. The growth in the amount of available data has created new challenges for organizations to analyze, store, process, and share it effectively. However, there is a need to establish proper guidance and best practices for effective data management in organizations across various industries.

Databases, information systems (IS), and big data management are three pillars of successful data management strategy. Within each pillar, specific techniques and principles apply to optimize the usage of data for optimal results. Here is how they fit together:

1. Databases: A database stores organized collections of data and provides APIs for accessing and manipulating them. They are designed to handle scalability, reliability, and availability requirements for enterprise applications. There are different types of databases ranging from relational to NoSQL, SQL Server, MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, HBase, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) to name a few. Different databases have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, MySQL is known for its robust performance but may not support complex queries. On the other hand, MongoDB offers faster query times but requires additional configuration to enable sharding and replication. Choosing the right type of database depends on the kind of data being stored, volume, size, complexity, and access patterns of the application. Additionally, a good database design can save time, effort, and costs over the long run.

Security measures such as encryption, authentication, authorization, and auditing are critical for protecting sensitive data. Performance optimization involves tuning the database schema, indexing, caching, and query execution plans. Business Intelligence (BI) tools provide interactive visualizations of data and present it in easy-to-understand formats.

3. Big data management: As the name suggests, big data management refers to the collection, storage, processing, analysis, and sharing of massive datasets using novel methods and technologies. To achieve this goal, organizations must employ distributed computing platforms, fast data streams, machine learning algorithms, and advanced analytics frameworks. Large-scale data sets require specialized hardware infrastructure and cloud services to handle the sheer scale of data generated daily. Standardization of approaches, policies, and procedures helps ensure data quality, consistency, and traceability throughout the lifecycle of a dataset. Managing big data requires careful planning, implementation, testing, and maintenance efforts. Organizations should strive towards continuous improvement and innovation to stay ahead of the curve in addressing emerging big data challenges.

Overall, the success of any company relies heavily on its data management capabilities. By implementing effective strategies for data management, companies can successfully navigate the ever-growing landscape of big data while meeting strict compliance regulations and ensuring privacy protection. 

3. Basic Concept Terminology Explanation 

To begin with, let’s briefly go through the key concepts and terminologies used in databases, IS, and big data management.

1. Data Warehouse: A data warehouse is a central repository of data that contains curated and integrated extracts from one or more sources. It acts as a single source of truth for organizing, analyzing, and delivering business information. It functions as a single point of contact between business users and IT departments to promote transparency, control, and efficiency in data governance and delivery. It typically comprises a combination of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. The data warehouse serves as a basis for creating reports, dashboards, and analytical tools for both internal and external stakeholders.

2. Enterprise Data Integration: Enterprise data integration refers to the process of integrating diverse data sources to enhance data quality, accuracy, and completeness. Typically, enterprise data integration involves converting data formats, cleaning, standardizing, enriching, and validating data before storing it in a data lake. Integrating data allows organizations to unlock hidden value, gain actionable insights, and increase customer engagement.

3. Extract, Transform, Load (ETL): ETL stands for extracting data from multiple sources, transforming it into a common format, and loading it into a destination. It involves various stages involved in ingesting, cleansing, normalizing, aggregating, and formatting data before loading it into a target database. ETL plays a vital role in optimizing data quality, eliminating duplicates, and improving data integrity.

4. Data Lake: A data lake is a multi-dimensional repository of data stored in a variety of formats, often unstructured. It combines structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data sets along with metadata about those files. It facilitates exploration and discovery of data across heterogeneous sources and enables businesses to perform ad-hoc analytics and reporting quickly.

5. Data Mart: A data mart is a smaller subset of a larger data set that focuses on a particular business area or subject matter. It is extracted from a data warehouse after performing necessary transformations. It serves as a precursor to building a customized BI tool suite focused on targeted business needs.

6. Data Mining: Data mining is the process of discovering patterns in large datasets and applying statistical models to predict outcomes and make predictions. It is widely used in various fields such as finance, marketing, and healthcare. Data mining tools assist organizations in deriving insights from large datasets and driving significant business value.

7. Map Reduce: MapReduce is a programming model and an associated distributed computation framework for processing and generating large data sets in parallel across clusters of computers. It supports high throughput and low latency processing by distributing computations across multiple nodes in a cluster. Its widespread adoption has led to breakthroughs in scientific computing, natural language processing, social network analysis, and web search.

8. Apache Spark: Apache Spark is an open-source unified analytics engine that provides powerful big data processing capabilities.

4. Core Algorithm Prices and Operation Steps with Mathematical Formula Explanations

Data Science is the process of extracting meaningful insights from large datasets and translating them into actionable knowledge. Many modern data analysis techniques involve using math, statistics, and algorithms to extract insights from data. Here are some commonly used algorithms that organizations utilize:

1. Decision Trees: A decision tree is a classification method that involves splitting data into homogeneous regions based on feature attributes. It starts with the root node where all the data points belong to a certain class, and splits recursively until each leaf node represents a unique class label. Each branch corresponds to a test condition and each leaf node holds the predicted outcome for the corresponding input sample. It works well for small and medium sized datasets but struggles with imbalanced datasets or non-linear relationships. It takes up relatively less space compared to neural networks.

2. Random Forest: A random forest is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to reduce variance and improve overall accuracy. It creates multiple subsets of training data sampled randomly with replacement and trains a separate decision tree on each subset. The final output is calculated by averaging the prediction of individual decision trees. Random forests work well for both regression and classification tasks.

3. Naive Bayes Classifier: Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic algorithm that uses Bayes’ theorem to calculate the probability of a given observation belonging to a particular class. It is a simple algorithm that performs well even for highly skewed datasets. It is mostly used in text classification, spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and medical diagnosis.

4. K Means Clustering: K means clustering is a unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. It aims to minimize the sum of squared distances between centroids and samples, which makes it suitable for clustering large and noisy datasets. Other variants of K means clustering exist such as mini batch K means, fuzzy K means, and expectation maximization K means.

5. Support Vector Machines (SVMs): SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm that constructs a hyperplane in high dimensional spaces to classify data points. It assigns new data points to one category or another based on a kernel function applied to their features. SVM works well for binary classification tasks and supports nonlinear decision boundaries.

6. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that projects multivariate data onto a lower-dimensional subspace while retaining maximum information. It finds linear combinations of variables that maximize the variance explained by each component. It is used in image recognition, pattern recognition, and bioinformatics applications.

7. Linear Regression: Linear regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that fits a straight line to a set of data points. It estimates the coefficients of a regression equation, denoted by a vector called the model parameters. It is widely used for forecasting, anomaly detection, and causal inference.

8. Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is a variation of linear regression that is used for binary classification tasks. It produces a sigmoid function that maps probabilities between zero and one. It is widely used in spam filtering, click-through rate prediction, and survival analysis.

Some of the above mentioned algorithms are only a fraction of what organizations can leverage to analyze and interpret data. Additionally, many advancements have been made recently in deep learning and artificial intelligence research field, which demand proficiency in developing neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. In conclusion, strong foundation in mathematics, statistics, and algorithms plays a crucial role in leveraging data to make effective business decisions.
