# 1.简介
  

Machine learning（ML）是利用计算机来进行智能化分析的一类技术。一般来说，ML应用于各种各样的问题领域，包括图像识别、自然语言处理、推荐系统、病例诊断等。

In recent years, with the development of deep learning technology and big data storage capacity, it becomes increasingly popular to use ML algorithms for solving complex problems in various fields such as image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation system, diagnosis of diseases etc.

However, one common issue that remains is how to effectively design a machine learning model by using object-oriented programming (OOP). The traditional way of constructing an algorithm involves writing many lines of code, which makes it difficult to maintain and update the codes over time. Moreover, this approach does not fully leverage the power of modern OOP languages like Python or Java, resulting in less efficient coding and higher maintenance costs. 

To address these issues, we propose a new methodology called "Object Oriented Programming for Machine Learning" (OOML), which aims at leveraging the power of OOP to improve the efficiency and scalability of machine learning models. In particular, our proposed methodology uses principles from Object-Oriented Design (OOD) and Model-Based Engineering (MBE) to build reusable software components called “objects” that can be easily assembled into complex ML systems. This approach allows researchers to focus on building individual objects while making their solutions more modular and extensible.

We will demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of our proposed framework through examples, including image classification, text analytics, and recommender systems. We will also discuss potential challenges and limitations of our approach and provide suggestions for future research directions. Finally, we will conclude by summarizing the main ideas behind our work and suggesting ways forward. 


# 2.基本概念术语说明

Before delving into the technical details of our proposal, let's first review some fundamental concepts and terminologies related to OOP and MBE.

## 2.1 对象（Object）
Objects are instances of classes in object-oriented programming. A class defines the set of attributes and behaviors that characterize all its instances. Each instance contains specific values for those attributes, enabling them to behave differently according to different contexts. For example, consider a car class: it has attributes such as make, color, weight, and speed, and behaviors such as accelerate, brake, turn left, and turn right. An instance of the car class could have different attribute values depending on whether it's being driven in daytime or nighttime, whether it's currently stopped, moving along a roadway, or reversing gears. By contrast, other types of objects may represent physical things such as doors, windows, or computers, or abstract entities such as people, places, or ideas.

## 2.2 属性（Attribute）
Attributes define the characteristics or features of an object. They are variables that hold information about an object's state. In OOP, each attribute belongs to a class, and they can be accessed and modified only via methods of the same class or inherited from parent classes. Attributes typically describe the properties of an object and can take on different values across multiple instances of the class. For example, a person class might have attributes such as name, age, gender, occupation, education level, hobbies, and preferences. These attributes would vary across different instances of the person class, but none of them would be duplicated within any single instance. 

## 2.3 方法（Method）
Methods define the actions that an object can perform. Methods are functions that belong to a class and can be invoked on instances of that class. They carry out the computations required to manipulate the state of an object and return results based on input parameters. For example, a student class might have methods such as enroll(), drop_course(), check_grades(), and so on. All these methods operate on the state of the student object and modify its attributes accordingly. When an instance of the student class is created, its initial value for each attribute can be provided either explicitly or implicitly, depending on the context.

## 2.4 继承（Inheritance）
Inheritance enables us to create new classes by deriving them from existing ones. It allows us to reuse code and reduce redundancy, thereby improving maintainability. A derived class inherits all the attributes and behaviors of its base class, plus any additional attributes or behavior specified by the programmer. For example, if we have a base class named animal and derive two child classes named dog and cat from it, both classes will share all the attributes and behaviors of the animal class except for their own unique ones. Inheritance provides a mechanism for creating hierarchies of classes where each subclass derives from its parent and adds additional functionality. 

## 2.5 多态性（Polymorphism）
Polymorphism refers to the ability of an object to take on many forms. In OOP, polymorphism means that a variable or parameter can refer to an instance of a superclass or interface type, allowing it to be used interchangeably without knowing its actual runtime type. Polymorphic behavior is achieved by providing methods with the same signature in both the superclass and the subclass, with the implementation differing in terms of what the method actually does. For example, suppose we have a shape class with subclasses rectangle, square, and circle, and we want to calculate the area of shapes dynamically regardless of their concrete type. We can achieve this using the following pseudocode:

```python
def getArea(shape):
    if isinstance(shape, Rectangle):
        # implement calculation logic for Rectangle
    elif isinstance(shape, Square):
        # implement calculation logic for Square
    else: 
        # implement calculation logic for Circle
```

Here, `getArea()` takes an instance of a Shape class as input and returns the area of the corresponding shape. Since all three shapes inherit from the Shape class, we can pass an instance of any subtype of Shape to the function, and it will automatically select the appropriate calculation logic for that shape. This technique allows for easy extension of the Shape hierarchy and ensures consistent usage throughout the program.
