# 1.简介
  

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known optimization problem in computer science. It involves visiting n distinct points in order to travel through them exactly once while minimizing the total distance traveled. The problem is widely used for various applications such as logistics, routing, transportation planning, scheduling etc., with significant impact on industries like manufacturing, energy, retail etc. In recent years, several solvers have been developed to solve the TSP problem using different techniques, including brute force search, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms and others. However, it has become increasingly difficult to compare these solvers directly due to their different characteristics and limitations. To address this challenge, there exists a popular benchmark dataset called the TSPLIB. This paper aims at providing insights into the properties of the TSP datasets available within TSPLIB and comparing different solver algorithms based on their performance. 

In addition to being a useful resource, the availability of multiple benchmarks can also be used to evaluate new algorithms and improve existing ones. Additionally, implementing parallel or distributed computing solutions can help speed up the computation time required by some solvers. Hence, having good knowledge about the various challenges faced by the community is essential if one wishes to advance towards more efficient and effective solvers that are tailored to specific domains or application scenarios. Thus, our objective in this article will be to provide an overview of current state-of-the-art in solving the TSP problem and its corresponding datasets, and then apply appropriate techniques to analyze the data and build models for predictive purposes. We will first explore the structure of the TSP datasets, which include historical datasets, classical instances, modern instances, and even artificial datasets generated from mathematical equations. Next, we will conduct experiments on different types of solvers and use statistical analysis to compare their performance against each other. Finally, we will discuss the implications of applying deep learning approaches to the TSP domain and identify open research problems associated with it. Our ultimate goal would be to develop advanced solvers capable of handling large-scale real-world problems efficiently and effectively.
