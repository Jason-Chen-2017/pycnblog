# Sentiment analysis is a technique of identifying and extracting subjective information from text data such as social media posts, customer reviews, news articles or product descriptions. This type of analysis helps organizations to understand public opinion towards various topics and products, thus enabling better decision making and product development. 
The task of sentiment analysis can be classified into two categories - rule-based and machine learning based approaches. Rule-based approach involves using pre-defined lexicons which are manually constructed by domain experts to identify the emotions expressed in the text. Machine learning techniques use statistical algorithms to learn patterns and correlations in the training dataset to classify new instances with respect to their sentiments. 

In this article, we will focus on one particular aspect of sentiment analysis: detecting negativity in social media comments. We will discuss about how to preprocess the textual data, choose an appropriate algorithm for classification and interpret the results obtained using different evaluation metrics.

This article assumes that the reader has some knowledge of Python programming language and basic concepts of natural language processing (NLP). It also provides links to resources where readers can get more details on the used tools and libraries.

## Tokenization
Tokenization refers to breaking down sentences into words or terms. In order to perform sentiment analysis, we need to break down the sentence into individual tokens i.e., individual words/terms. The most common tokenization method is called "word level tokenization" where each word is treated as a token. There are other forms of tokenization like character level tokenization, sub-word tokenization etc. But here, we will only consider word level tokenization.
## Vocabulary
A vocabulary consists of all possible words or terms that occur in the text corpus. For example, if our text corpus contains movie review datasets, then the vocabulary would include all unique words present in those datasets. The size of the vocabulary determines the number of dimensions in our feature space. A larger vocabulary implies higher dimensionality but may lead to overfitting. Hence, it's essential to balance between a large enough vocabulary and high dimensional features without losing important information.
## Bag-of-Words model
Bag-of-words models represent text as vectors consisting of integer counts representing the frequency of occurrence of each word within the document. The vector length corresponds to the total number of words in the vocabulary. Each element in the vector represents the count of the corresponding term in the vocabulary. The simplest way to create a bag-of-words representation of a sentence is to split the sentence into words and count their occurrences in the respective documents.

For example, suppose we have three documents D1, D2 and D3 respectively containing "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", "John likes ice cream" and "I hate hot dogs". Then the bag-of-words representation of these documents will look something like:

| Document | Vector   |
|----------|----------|
| D1       | [0,1,0,0] |
| D2       | [1,0,1,0] |
| D3       | [0,0,0,1] |

Here, the first row represents the "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps" words while the second row represents the "likes", "ice", "cream" words and so on. Note that there is no position information attached to any of the words. The vector values indicate the number of times each term occurred in the given document.

One advantage of using bag-of-words representations is that they offer a simple and efficient way to extract relevant features from text. However, it does not capture any semantic meaning associated with the words. Therefore, it might miss out on certain nuances and context specific features. To address this issue, we can leverage more advanced NLP techniques like Named Entity Recognition, Part-of-speech tagging, Dependency parsing, Word Embeddings etc. These techniques help us capture the context specific meaning of the words and provide a richer understanding of the text.


# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解
There are several methods available for performing sentiment analysis. One popular technique is to use bag-of-words models combined with machine learning algorithms like logistic regression or Naive Bayes. 

Before building our own classifier, let's go through the basic steps involved in performing sentiment analysis using bag-of-words models:

1. Preprocess Text Data
    * Remove stop words, punctuations, special characters, URLs, mentions etc.
    * Convert all words to lowercase or uppercase depending upon our preference.
    * Stemming vs Lemmatization
        + Stemming reduces a word to its root form while removing affixes like 'ing' or 'ed'. 
        + On the other hand, lemmatization reduces the inflected words properly ensuring that the root word belongs to the language's vocabulary. 
    * Create n-grams
2. Convert Text Data into Feature Vectors using Bag-of-Words Model
   * Count the frequency of every word in each document. 
   * Take logarithmic transformation of frequencies to convert them to a range of [-1,1]. 
3. Split the data into Train and Test Sets
    * Use part of the data for training and remaining for testing purposes. This ensures that we avoid overfitting.
4. Choose an Appropriate Algorithm for Classification
    * Logistic Regression Classifier
    * Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    * Random Forest Classifier
5. Train the Selected Classifier on Training Set
    * Feed the feature vectors into the classifier along with their labels indicating positive/negative polarity.
6. Evaluate Performance of Classifier on Test Set
    * Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve and AUC-ROC score. 
    * Based on the evaluation scores, fine tune the hyperparameters of the selected classifier until you achieve satisfactory performance.
