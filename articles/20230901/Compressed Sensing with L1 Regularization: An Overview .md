Compressed sensing (CS) is a signal processing technique that enables obtaining measurements from sparse linear measurements or subsets of the original measurement vectors by leveraging the redundancy present in the data. In CS, we assume that there exists some low-rank matrix $L$ such that $\text{vec}(x)=Lx$, where $x \in R^m$ is the input vector to be reconstructed, $\text{vec}$ denotes the concatenation operator, and the symbol $L$ denotes the low-rank component of the matrix. The basic idea behind compressed sensing is that if we have access to only k columns of the measurements at hand, then we can recover the entire vector x by solving the following optimization problem:
\begin{align*}
    \underset{x}{\text{min}} &\quad \|Ax - b\|_2 \\ 
    \text{s.t.} &\quad \|Lx - y\|_2 = \|z\|_{\infty},~~y=b+w,~w \in R^k
\end{align*}
where A is the measurement matrix and b is the observation vector corresponding to the sparse measurements. 

The above formulation assumes that we are given an incomplete set of measurements for which some entries are unknown and must be inferred using the remaining measurements. This leads to a tradeoff between the number of measurements used and their accuracy. We can modify this framework to incorporate regularization terms to balance the tradeoff between the model complexity (i.e., degree of compression) and noise level in the observed signal. Specifically, we can add a term proportional to the absolute values of all components of x in the objective function:
\begin{align*}
    \underset{x}{\text{min}} &\quad \|A(L^\top z + c_0x) - (b+c_1w)\|_2 + \lambda \|x\|_{1}
\end{align*}
Here, $\lambda>0$ is a non-negative parameter that controls the amount of regularization, $c_0>0$ and $c_1>0$ are constants that control the tradeoff between the data fitting and regularization objectives, respectively. When $\lambda=0$, the problem reduces to one without regularization; when $\lambda=\infty$, it becomes equivalent to standard least squares regression.

In general, CS has many applications ranging from imaging, medical diagnosis, computer vision, speech recognition, etc. In this paper, we will discuss different methods available for solving compressed sensing problems as well as highlight key insights and challenges encountered while performing these reconstruction tasks. To summarize, our aim is to provide an overview of various approaches towards solving compressed sensing problems along with critical insights on how they work under different settings and scenarios, including numerical issues, stochasticity, batch effects, and dimensionality reduction techniques. Our article aims to contribute valuable insight into the field by providing an accessible yet detailed account of recent advances made in this area, making it suitable for both researchers and practitioners alike.
