## 3. Core Algorithms, Principles, and Mathematical Models

### 3.1. Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that uses labeled training data to learn a mapping between input features and output labels. Common supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines, and decision trees. In the energy industry, supervised learning algorithms can be used for demand forecasting, price prediction, anomaly detection, and equipment failure prediction.

#### 3.1.1. Linear Regression

Linear regression is a simple supervised learning algorithm that models the relationship between a continuous dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear function. Given a set of input features $x$ and a target variable $y$, linear regression estimates the parameters $\beta$ of the following equation:

$$y = \beta_0 + \sum\_{i=1}^{n} \beta\_i x\_i + \epsilon$$

where $\epsilon$ represents the residual error.

#### 3.1.2. Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a variation of linear regression that models the probability of a binary outcome given a set of input features. It uses the logistic function, which maps any real-valued number to a probability value between 0 and 1. The logistic function is defined as follows:

$$p(y=1|x) = \frac{1}{1+\exp(-(\beta\_0 + \sum\_{i=1}^{n} \beta\_i x\_i))}$$

where $p(y=1|x)$ represents the probability of the positive class, given the input features $x$.

### 3.2. Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that uses unlabeled training data to discover hidden patterns or structures in the data. Common unsupervised learning algorithms include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection. In the energy industry, unsupervised learning algorithms can be used for anomaly detection, fault diagnosis, and energy consumption pattern analysis.

#### 3.2.1. K-Means Clustering

K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions a dataset into $k$ clusters based on their similarities. The algorithm iteratively assigns each data point to the nearest centroid and updates the centroids until convergence. The objective function of K-means clustering is to minimize the sum of squared distances between each data point and its assigned centroid.

#### 3.2.2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms a high-dimensional dataset into a lower-dimensional space while preserving the maximum amount of variance. PCA identifies the principal components, which are the directions of maximum variance in the data, and projects the data onto these components. PCA can be used for feature selection, noise filtering, and visualization.

### 3.3. Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multi-layer neural networks to model complex relationships between input features and output labels. Deep learning models can learn hierarchical representations of data and extract abstract features from raw inputs. Common deep learning architectures include convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. In the energy industry, deep learning models can be used for image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive maintenance.

#### 3.3.1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs are a type of deep learning architecture that is commonly used for image recognition tasks. CNNs consist of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Convolutional layers apply filters to the input images to extract features, such as edges, shapes, and textures. Pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps by selecting the maximum or average values within a sliding window. Fully connected layers perform the final classification task by mapping the extracted features to output labels.

#### 3.3.2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

RNNs are a type of deep learning architecture that is commonly used for sequential data analysis tasks, such as time series forecasting and natural language processing. RNNs use feedback connections to propagate information from previous time steps to the current time step, allowing them to capture temporal dependencies in the data. LSTM networks are a variant of RNNs that use gating mechanisms to selectively retain or forget information from previous time steps, thereby improving their ability to handle long-range dependencies.

## 4. Best Practices and Code Examples

### 4.1. Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is an essential step in AI applications, including data cleaning, normalization, transformation, and feature engineering. Data cleaning involves removing missing or corrupted values, handling outliers, and dealing with noisy data. Data normalization scales the input features to a common range, such as [0, 1] or [-1, 1], to ensure that all features have equal weight in the model. Data transformation involves converting categorical variables into numerical ones, aggregating data points, or creating new features based on existing ones. Feature engineering involves selecting relevant features, generating new features, and reducing the dimensionality of the data.

#### 4.1.1. Data Cleaning Example

The following example shows how to remove missing values from a pandas DataFrame using the `dropna()` method:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the data from a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('energy_data.csv')

# Remove rows with missing values
cleaned_data = data.dropna()
```
#### 4.1.2. Data Normalization Example

The following example shows how to normalize the input features using the `MinMaxScaler` class from scikit-learn library:
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Create a scaler object
scaler = MinMaxScaler()

# Normalize the input features
normalized_features = scaler.fit_transform(features)
```
### 4.2. Model Training and Evaluation

Model training involves selecting an appropriate algorithm, tuning hyperparameters, splitting the data into training and validation sets, fitting the model to the training data, and evaluating its performance on the validation set. Model evaluation involves computing metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and confusion matrix, to assess the model's quality. Model selection involves comparing different algorithms and hyperparameter configurations to identify the best one for the given problem.

#### 4.2.1. Model Training Example

The following example shows how to train a linear regression model using the `LinearRegression` class from scikit-learn library:
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Initialize the model
model = LinearRegression()

# Fit the model to the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the validation set
predictions = model.predict(X_val)
```
#### 4.2.2. Model Evaluation Example

The following example shows how to compute the mean squared error (MSE) metric for a regression model:
```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Compute the MSE metric
mse = mean_squared_error(y_val, predictions)

# Print the MSE value
print('Mean Squared Error:', mse)
```
### 4.3. Model Deployment and Monitoring

Model deployment involves deploying the trained model to a production environment, such as a web server or a cloud platform. Model monitoring involves tracking the model's performance over time, detecting drifts or anomalies, and retraining the model as needed. Model versioning involves maintaining different versions of the model and associated metadata, such as code, data, and documentation. Model explainability involves providing insights into the model's decision-making process, such as feature importance, partial dependence plots, and local interpretations.

#### 4.3.1. Model Deployment Example

The following example shows how to deploy a machine learning model using Flask, a popular web framework in Python:
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
   # Parse the input data from JSON format
   data = request.get_json()
   input_features = np.array(list(data.values()))

   # Make predictions using the trained model
   prediction = model.predict(input_features.reshape(1, -1))[0]

   # Return the prediction as JSON format
   return jsonify({'prediction': prediction})

if __name__ == '__main__':
   app.run(debug=True)
```
#### 4.3.2. Model Monitoring Example

The following example shows how to monitor a machine learning model using Prometheus, a popular monitoring system in Python:
```python
from prometheus_client import Summary, Counter, Gauge, CollectorRegistry, push_to_gateway

# Define metrics for model performance
requests = Counter('http_requests_total', 'Total number of HTTP requests')
latency = Summary('http_request_latency_seconds', 'Time taken to handle HTTP requests')
accuracy = Gauge('model_accuracy', 'Model accuracy')

# Initialize the collector registry
registry = CollectorRegistry()

# Register the metrics with the collector registry
prometheus.register(requests)
prometheus.register(latency)
prometheus.register(accuracy)

@app.before_first_request
def before_first_request():
   # Push the initial metrics to Prometheus
   push_to_gateway('localhost:9090', job='my_job', registry=registry)

@app.after_request
def after_request(response):
   # Record the metrics for each HTTP request
   requests.inc()
   latency.observe(time.monotonic() - request.start_time)

   # Update the model accuracy metric periodically
   accuracy.set(model.score(X_val, y_val))

   # Push the updated metrics to Prometheus
   push_to_gateway('localhost:9090', job='my_job', registry=registry)

   return response
```
