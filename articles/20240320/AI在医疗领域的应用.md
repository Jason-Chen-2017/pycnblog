p(y|x;\theta) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\theta_0 + \theta_1 x)}} \quad (\text{Logistic Regression})
$$

### 3.2 Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning trains a model using unlabeled data, aiming to discover hidden patterns or structures within the data. Commonly used algorithms include k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and autoencoders.

### 3.3 Deep Learning

Deep learning uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex representations from data. Popular architectures include convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), and transformers.

$$

## 4. Best Practices and Real-World Implementations

### 4.1 Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is crucial for ensuring the quality and effectiveness of AI algorithms. Steps include data cleaning, normalization, augmentation, and splitting into training, validation, and test sets.

### 4.2 Model Selection and Evaluation

Model selection involves choosing the most appropriate algorithm for a given problem. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, and confusion matrix can be used to evaluate the performance of the chosen model.

### 4.3 Code Example: Diabetes Risk Prediction

The following code demonstrates a simple implementation of diabetes risk prediction using logistic regression in Python:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv("diabetes.csv")

# Preprocess data
X = data.drop("Outcome", axis=1)
y = data["Outcome"]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
report = classification_report(y_test, predictions)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Classification Report:\n", report)
```
