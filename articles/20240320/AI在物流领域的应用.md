## 3. Core Algorithms, Principles, and Mathematical Models

### 3.1 Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained using labeled data. In other words, the input data is associated with the correct output. Once the algorithm has learned from the training data, it can apply what it has learned to new, unseen data. Linear regression, decision trees, and support vector machines are examples of supervised learning algorithms.

#### 3.1.1 Linear Regression

Linear regression is a simple yet powerful statistical modeling technique used to analyze the relationship between two continuous variables. It can be used in logistics to predict demand based on historical data.

#### 3.1.2 Decision Trees

Decision trees are a type of supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. They work by recursively partitioning the feature space into smaller regions, creating a tree-like structure where each node represents a decision based on a feature value.

#### 3.1.3 Support Vector Machines

Support vector machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. SVMs work by finding the optimal boundary or hyperplane that separates the classes while maximizing the margin.

### 3.2 Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained using unlabeled data. The goal is to find hidden patterns or structures in the data without prior knowledge of the output. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are examples of unsupervised learning techniques.

#### 3.2.1 K-Means Clustering

In this section, we will provide code samples and detailed explanations for implementing several AI techniques in logistics. We will use Python as our programming language and leverage popular libraries such as NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.

### 4.1 Demand Forecasting with Linear Regression

To implement linear regression for demand forecasting, follow these steps:

1. Collect historical demand data and store it in a pandas DataFrame.
2. Preprocess the data by cleaning, normalizing, and transforming it if necessary.
3. Define the linear regression model using scikit-learn's LinearRegression class.
4. Train the model using the preprocessed data.
5. Evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset.
6. Use the trained model to make predictions on future demand.

Here's an example code snippet for demand forecasting with linear regression:
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Step 1: Load historical demand data
data = pd.read_csv('demand_data.csv')

# Step 2: Preprocess the data
# ...

# Step 3: Define the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Step 4: Train the model
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
   data['Timestamp'], data['Demand'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train.values.reshape(-1, 1), y_train)

# Step 5: Evaluate the model
score = model.score(X_test.values.reshape(-1, 1), y_test)
print(f"Model score: {score}")

# Step 6: Make predictions on future demand
future_demand = model.predict(pd.date_range(start='2023-01-01', end='2023-12-31'))
```
### 4.2 Route Optimization with Ant Colony Optimization

Ant colony optimization (ACO) is a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the behavior of ants searching for food. It can be applied to vehicle routing problems, where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of locations. Here's how to implement ACO for route optimization:

1. Define the graph representing the locations and distances between them.
2. Initialize the pheromone matrix and heuristic information.
3. Repeat the following steps until convergence or maximum iterations reached:
a. Construct ants' routes based on the pheromone matrix and heuristic information.
b. Update the pheromone matrix based on the ants' routes.
c. Calculate the total distance traveled by each ant.
4. Return the shortest route.

Here's an example code snippet for route optimization with ACO:
```python
import numpy as np

class AntColonyOptimization:
   def __init__(self, num_ants, evaporation_rate, alpha, beta):
       self.num_ants = num_ants
       self.evaporation_rate = evaporation_rate
       self.alpha = alpha
       self.beta = beta
       self.pheromone_matrix = np.ones((n_nodes, n_nodes))
       
   def solve(self, distance_matrix):
       # Step 1: Define the graph
       # ...

       # Step 2: Initialize the pheromone matrix and heuristic information
       # ...

       # Step 3: Repeat the following steps until convergence or maximum iterations reached
       for _ in range(max_iterations):
           # Step 3a: Construct ants' routes
           routes = [self._construct_route(ant, distance_matrix) for ant in range(self.num_ants)]

           # Step 3b: Update the pheromone matrix
           self._update_pheromone(routes, distance_matrix)

           # Step 3c: Calculate the total distance traveled by each ant
           distances = [self._calculate_distance(route, distance_matrix) for route in routes]

       # Step 4: Return the shortest route
       best_route = min(routes, key=lambda x: x[-1])
       return best_route

# Example usage
aco = AntColonyOptimization(num_ants=10, evaporation_rate=0.5, alpha=1, beta=2)
distance_matrix = ...
shortest_route = aco.solve(distance_matrix)
```
