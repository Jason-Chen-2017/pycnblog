## 背景介绍

### 什么是人工智能？

* 人工智能(Artificial Intelligence, AI)是指那些能够执行需要某种程度智能才能完成的任务的系统。
* 它是计算机科学领域研究如何让 machines mimic — or surpass — human intelligence 的一个分支。

### 什么是深度学习？

* Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of machine learning that’s based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.
* It can process a wide range of data resources, learn complex patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

### 深度学习与传统机器学习的区别

* Traditional machine learning algorithms usually require humans to select the features used in the model, while deep learning models learn representations of the data directly from input.
* As a result, deep learning models are able to handle larger volumes of unstructured data than traditional machine learning models.

## 核心概念与联系

### Artificial Neural Networks

* ANNs are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.
* They're designed to simulate the way humans learn and process information.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

* CNNs are a specialized class of artificial neural networks designed to tackle computer vision problems.
* They have proven highly effective in identifying faces, objects and traffic signs apart from powering vision in robots and self driving cars.

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

* RNNs are a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form directed cycles.
* This creates an internal state of memory that captures information about what has been calculated before.
* They're great at handling sequential data like time series analysis, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

### Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)

* LSTMs are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies, which makes them particularly useful for tasks involving sequences of data with potentially long gaps between relevant information.

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

* GANs consist of two parts:
	+ A generator network that creates new data instances
	+ A discriminator network that tries to distinguish between real and fake instances
* Through an adversarial process, the generator can get better and better at producing realistic data, while the discriminator gets better at detecting fakes.

### Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)

* DRL combines reinforcement learning with deep learning to handle high-dimensional inputs.
* The agent learns how to perform actions based on reward feedback, making it suitable for complex tasks such as autonomous driving and playing video games.

## 核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解

### Backpropagation Algorithm

* It's the workhorse behind training neural networks.
* The algorithm computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights by applying the chain rule recursively, iterating backward from the last layer to avoid redundant calculations of intermediate terms in the chain rule.

### Activation Functions

* They introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn more complex patterns.
* Common activation functions include sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU.

### Gradient Descent Optimization

* It's used to minimize some function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient.
* Variants include Stochastic Gradient Descent, Mini-Batch Gradient Descent, and Adam Optimizer.

### Convolutional Layers

* They apply a convolution operation to the input, passing the result to the next layer.
* This helps to identify patterns in the data.

### Pooling Layers

* They progressively reduce the spatial size of the representation, to reduce the amount of parameters and computation in the network.

### Fully Connected Layer

* Every neuron in a layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer.
* Information flows in one direction: from input to output.

### Long Short-Term Memory Cells

* LSTM units include an input gate, an output gate and a forget gate.
* These gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell.

### Training Generative Adversarial Networks

* The goal is to find the parameters $\theta^{(G)}$ and $\theta^{(D)}$ of $G$ and $D$, minimizing the following objective function:
$$
\min_G \max_D V(D, G) = \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_{data}(x)} [\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z\sim p_z(z)}[\log (1 - D(G(z)))]
$$

### Q-learning

* Q-learning is a value-based algorithm in reinforcement learning.
* The agent learns the action-value function $Q(s, a)$ which represents the expected cumulative reward of taking action $a$ in state $s$.

### Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)

* DDPG is an algorithm which concurrently learns a Q-function and a policy.
* It uses off-policy data and the Bellman equation to learn the Q-function, and uses the Q-function to learn the policy.

## 附录：常见问题与解答

### Q: Why do we need deep learning when we already have machine learning?

A: While traditional machine learning algorithms can be highly effective, they often require extensive feature engineering by humans. Deep learning models learn representations directly from input data, making them capable of handling larger volumes of unstructured data without the need for extensive feature engineering.

### Q: How does backpropagation work?

A: Backpropagation is an algorithm used to train artificial neural networks. It calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight by applying the chain rule recursively, iterating backward from the last layer to avoid redundant calculations of intermediate terms in the chain rule. This allows the network to adjust its weights and biases to minimize the loss.

### Q: What are activation functions, and why are they important?

A: Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn more complex patterns. Without activation functions, even deep neural networks would be limited to linear transformations of the input data, which wouldn't be very powerful. Common activation functions include sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU.
