## 背景介绍

### 1.1 什么是Theano？

Theano is a popular open-source Python library for highly optimized numerical computations, particularly well-suited for large-scale machine learning tasks. It allows users to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. Theano automatically generates C code for the computation graph defined by the user, which significantly accelerates the performance compared to pure Python implementations.

### 1.2 什么是卷积神经网络？

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are powerful deep learning models inspired by the visual cortex of animals. They have shown remarkable results in various computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. CNNs consist of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers that process input images with filters, downsample feature maps, and make final predictions.

## 核心概念与联系

### 2.1 Theano vs. TensorFlow and PyTorch

While TensorFlow and PyTorch have gained popularity in recent years, Theano remains an essential tool for deep learning researchers due to its flexibility, expressiveness, and high performance. Understanding Theano's design principles can help you grasp other libraries better and improve your proficiency in deep learning.

### 2.2 Theano's Computation Graph

Theano represents computations using a data structure called a *computation graph*. This graph consists of nodes representing mathematical operations, and edges representing inputs and outputs. By constructing this graph, Theano enables automatic differentiation, optimization, and efficient code generation.

### 3.1 Defining a Convolutional Layer

To define a convolutional layer in Theano, we need to specify the filter size, stride, padding, and activation function. Theano provides several functions like `scan`, `dimshuffle`, and `nnet.conv` to facilitate building the convolution operation. Here's a basic example:
```python
import theano
import theano.tensor as T
from theano.compile.ops import as_op

def conv2d(input_image, filter):
   # ... Define the convolution operation here ...
```
### 3.2 Defining a Pooling Layer

Pooling layers help reduce spatial dimensions while preserving relevant features. Common pooling types include max pooling and average pooling. To implement these layers in Theano, use the `downsample` function with appropriate window sizes and strides.
```python
def max_pool(inputs, window_size, stride):
   return T.max(inputs.reshape((inputs.shape[0], inputs.shape[1] // stride,
                              window_size, window_size)), axis=(3, 2))
```
### 3.3 Building a Complete CNN

A complete CNN would typically include convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers, and nonlinear activation functions. Use `theano.function` to compile your model and create symbolic variables for inputs, filters, biases, and other parameters.
```python
x = T.matrix("inputs")
y = T.vector("outputs")
w1, b1, w2, b2 = shared_variables()
p_1 = act_func(conv2d(x, w1) + b1)
p_2 = act_func(full_connect(p_1, w2) + b2)
cost = cross_entropy(p_2, y)
train = theano.function(inputs=[x, y], outputs=cost, updates=...)
predict = theano.function(inputs=[x], outputs=p_2)
```
### 3.4 Training the Model

Training a CNN involves minimizing a loss function through backpropagation and optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD). You can update weights and biases using `updates` argument in `theano.function`.
```python
learning_rate = 0.1
gradient_descent = SGD(cost, params=[w1, b1, w2, b2], learning_rate=learning_rate)
training_data = load_dataset()
for epoch in range(epochs):
   for batch in training_data:
       cost = train(batch.inputs, batch.outputs)
```

### 4.1 Implementing a Simple CNN

Let's build a simple CNN to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. We will use three convolutional layers, two pooling layers, and a fully connected layer.
```python
# Load the MNIST dataset
train_set, valid_set, test_set = load_mnist_data()

# Create the CNN architecture
x = T.matrix("inputs")
y = T.ivector("outputs")

# Layers definition
w1, b1, w2, b2, w3, b3, w4, b4 = init_shared_variables()

p_1 = relu(conv2d(x, w1) + b1)
p_1 = max_pool(p_1, 2, 2)

p_2 = relu(conv2d(p_1, w2) + b2)
p_2 = max_pool(p_2, 2, 2)

p_3 = relu(conv2d(p_2, w3) + b3)
p_3 = max_pool(p_3, 2, 2)

p_flat = p_3.flatten(ndim=3)

f_1 = relu(T.dot(p_flat, w4) + b4)

# Cost function and training algorithm
cost = softmax_cross_entropy(f_1, y)
gradient_descent = SGD(cost, params=[w1, b1, w2, b2, w3, b3, w4, b4], learning_rate=0.05)
train = theano.function(inputs=[x, y], outputs=cost, updates=gradient_descent)

# Prediction function
predict = theano.function(inputs=[x], outputs=T.argmax(f_1, axis=1))

# Train the network
train_data = zip(train_set[0], train_set[1])
for epoch in range(50):
   for batch in train_data:
       train(batch[0].reshape(-1, 28, 28), batch[1])
```
## 实际应用场景

CNNs have numerous applications in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and facial recognition. They are also used in natural language processing for text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. Moreover, CNNs can be combined with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) to process sequential data like videos or time series.

## 附录：常见问题与解答

**Q**: Why is my CNN not converging?

**A**: There could be several reasons, including improper hyperparameter tuning, insufficient training data, vanishing gradients, overfitting, or incorrect model architecture. Try adjusting learning rates, adding regularization techniques, increasing your dataset size, using pre-trained models, or modifying the network design.

**Q**: How do I visualize feature maps produced by my CNN?

**A**: Use Python libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to display individual channels or average pooled features. Alternatively, you can use dedicated tools like TensorBoard or PlotNeuralNet to visualize the entire computation graph and monitor training progress.
