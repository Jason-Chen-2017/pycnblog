### 2. 核心概念与联系

#### 2.1 人工智能

- **定义**：Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.
- **类型**：There are two main types of AI: narrow or weak AI, designed to perform specific tasks, and general or strong AI, capable of handling any intellectual challenge.

#### 2.2 机器学习

- **定义**：Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computer systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
- **监督学习**：Supervised learning involves training models on labeled datasets, where input-output pairs are provided.
- **无监督学习**：Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data and focuses on discovering hidden patterns or structures within the data.
- **强化学习**：Reinforcement learning is an interactive learning approach, where an agent learns to make decisions by trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.

#### 2.3 深度学习

- **定义**：Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and solve complex problems.
- **神经网络**：Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes or neurons, organized into layers. They can learn representations of data through a process called backpropagation.

### 3. 核心算法原理和具体操作步骤

#### 3.1 支持向量机（SVM）

- **原理**：SVM is a supervised learning algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane separating classes in a high-dimensional feature space. Kernel functions are used to map nonlinearly separable data into higher dimensions where it becomes linearly separable.
- **数学公式**：
   - $y = w^T x + b$
   - $minimize \frac{1}{2} ||w||^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^{N} \xi_i$
   - $\text{subject to } y_i(w^T x_i + b) \geq 1 - \xi_i, \xi_i \geq 0$

#### 3.2 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

- **原理**：CNNs are deep learning models specifically designed for image and signal processing tasks. They use convolutional and pooling layers to extract features and reduce dimensionality.
- **数学公式**：
   - Convolutional layer: $(w * x)_j = \sum_{k} w_k x_{j+k}$
   - Pooling layer: $down(x)_j = \max_{k \in [0, m)} x_{j*r + k}$

#### 3.3 强化学习

- **原理**：Reinforcement learning agents interact with their environments by taking actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The goal is to maximize cumulative reward over time.
- **数学公式**：
   - Q-learning: $Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha[r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s,a)]$

clf = svm.SVC()
clf.fit(X, y)

# Predict new data points

   state = env.reset()
   done = False

   while not done:
       action = np.argmax(Q[state, :])
       next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)

       # Update the Q-value
       old_Q = Q[state, action]
       new_Q = reward + 0.99 * np.max(Q[next_state, :])
       Q[state, action] = old_Q + 0.01 * (new_Q - old_Q)

       state = next_state

# Test the trained agent
test_reward = 0
