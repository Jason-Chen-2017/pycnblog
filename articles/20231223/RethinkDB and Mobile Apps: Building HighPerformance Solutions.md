3. Implement real-time data synchronization: Use RethinkDB's real-time processing capabilities to synchronize data between the server and the client.
4. Handle offline support: Use RethinkDB's local data storage capabilities to support offline access to data.
5. Scale your app: Use RethinkDB's distributed architecture to scale your app horizontally as needed.

### 3.3 RethinkDB的数学模型公式详细讲解
RethinkDB uses a combination of distributed computing, real-time processing, and NoSQL data storage to provide high-performance data access. The mathematical models behind RethinkDB include:

- Distributed computing: RethinkDB uses a peer-to-peer network to distribute data and queries across multiple nodes. The mathematical model for this is based on graph theory, which is used to model the relationships between nodes in the network.
- Real-time processing: RethinkDB uses a real-time processing engine to handle real-time queries and updates. The mathematical model for this is based on queuing theory, which is used to model the behavior of queues in a system.
- NoSQL data storage: RethinkDB stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. The mathematical model for this is based on the B-tree data structure, which is used to store and retrieve data efficiently.

## 4.具体代码实例和详细解释说明
### 4.1 RethinkDB的具体代码实例
To get started with RethinkDB, you can use the following code example to set up a simple RethinkDB database:

```
// Install RethinkDB
npm install rethinkdb

// Start RethinkDB server
rethinkdb --start

// Connect to RethinkDB
const r = require('rethinkdb');
r.connect({ host: 'localhost', port: 28015 }, (err, conn) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    process.exit(1);
  }

  // Create a table
  r.tableCreate('users').run(conn, (err, res) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error(err);
      process.exit(1);
    }

    console.log('Table created');

    // Insert data into the table
    r.table('users').insert({ name: 'John Doe', age: 30 }).run(conn, (err, res) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error(err);
        process.exit(1);
      }

      console.log('Data inserted');

      // Query the table
      r.table('users').filter({ age: 30 }).run(conn, (err, cursor) => {
        if (err) {
          console.error(err);
          process.exit(1);
        }

        // Fetch the data
        cursor.toArray((err, results) => {
          if (err) {
            console.error(err);
            process.exit(1);
          }

          console.log(results);
        });
      });
    });
  });
});
```

### 4.2 RethinkDB的详细解释说明
In this code example, we first install RethinkDB using npm, and then start the RethinkDB server. We then connect to the RethinkDB server using the `r.connect()` method.

Next, we create a table called `users` using the `r.tableCreate()` method. We then insert data into the table using the `r.table('users').insert()` method.

Finally, we query the table using the `r.table('users').filter()` method, and fetch the data using the `cursor.toArray()` method.
