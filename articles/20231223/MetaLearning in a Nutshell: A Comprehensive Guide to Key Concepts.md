## 1. Background and Motivation

The motivation behind meta-learning stems from the observation that many machine learning tasks require a significant amount of data and computational resources to achieve good performance. This has led to the development of various techniques to improve learning efficiency, such as transfer learning, few-shot learning, and one-shot learning.

Meta-learning aims to create models that can learn how to learn from data, adapting to new tasks and environments quickly and efficiently. This is achieved by leveraging prior knowledge and experience to improve learning performance.

There are several key motivations behind meta-learning:

- **Adaptability**: Meta-learning models should be able to adapt to new tasks and environments quickly, without the need for extensive retraining.
- **Efficiency**: Meta-learning models should be able to learn from limited data and computational resources, making them suitable for real-world applications.
- **Generalization**: Meta-learning models should be able to generalize well to new tasks and environments, even when the training data is scarce.

In the next section, we will explore the core concepts and relations in meta-learning, providing a solid foundation for understanding the field.
