### 3.1 Core Algorithms of Apache Zeppelin

- **Apache Spark**: Zeppelin uses Apache Spark for distributed data processing. Spark provides a fast and flexible engine for data processing, which makes it suitable for large-scale data analysis tasks.
- **Hadoop**: Zeppelin uses Hadoop for distributed storage and processing. Hadoop provides a scalable and fault-tolerant storage system, which makes it suitable for storing and processing large amounts of data.
- **Flink**: Zeppelin uses Flink for real-time data processing. Flink provides a fast and scalable engine for real-time data processing, which makes it suitable for real-time data analysis tasks.

### 3.2 Specific Operations and Steps in Zeppelin

- **Creating a Notebook**: To create a notebook in Zeppelin, you need to click on the "New Notebook" button and select the interpreter you want to use.
- **Adding Data**: To add data to a notebook, you can use the "Data Source" panel to connect to a data source and import data into the notebook.
- **Writing Code**: To write code in a notebook, you can use the "Code" panel to write code in a cell.
- **Running Code**: To run code in a notebook, you can click on the "Run" button in the toolbar.

- **Hadoop**: Hadoop uses the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for distributed storage. HDFS is a scalable and fault-tolerant storage system that stores data in blocks and replicates blocks across multiple nodes in a cluster.
- **Flink**: Flink uses a data stream abstraction for real-time data processing. Data streams are sequences of records that can be transformed and analyzed using a variety of transformations and operations.

## 4.具体代码实例和详细解释说明

### 4.1 Sample Code in Zeppelin

```python
# Import the necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

# Perform some data analysis
summary = data.describe()

# Visualize the data
plt.plot(data["column1"], data["column2"])
plt.xlabel("Column 1")
plt.ylabel("Column 2")
plt.title("Sample Plot")
plt.show()
```

### 4.2 Detailed Explanation of the Code

- **Importing Libraries**: In this code, we first import the necessary libraries, including pandas and matplotlib.
- **Loading Data**: Next, we load the data from a CSV file using the `pd.read_csv()` function.
- **Performing Data Analysis**: We then perform some data analysis using the `describe()` function, which returns a summary of the data.
- **Visualizing Data**: Finally, we visualize the data using matplotlib, which is a popular Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
