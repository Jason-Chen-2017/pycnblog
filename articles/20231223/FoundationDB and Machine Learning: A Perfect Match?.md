Machine learning is used in a wide range of applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and recommendation systems.

#### 1.2.1 Types of machine learning

There are three main types of machine learning:

- Supervised learning: In supervised learning, the model is trained on a labeled dataset, where the input data is paired with the correct output. The model learns to map inputs to outputs by minimizing the difference between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs.
- Unsupervised learning: In unsupervised learning, the model is trained on an unlabeled dataset, where the input data does not have associated outputs. The model learns to find patterns or structures in the data, such as clusters or associations.
- Reinforcement learning: In reinforcement learning, the model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The model learns to make decisions that maximize the cumulative reward over time.

#### 1.2.2 Machine learning workflow

The typical machine learning workflow consists of the following steps:

1. Data collection and preprocessing: The first step in the machine learning workflow is to collect and preprocess the data. This involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a suitable format for training the model.
2. Feature selection and engineering: Feature selection and engineering involve selecting the most relevant features for the task and transforming the data to improve the model's performance.
3. Model selection and training: The next step is to select an appropriate model for the task and train it on the data. This involves choosing the model's architecture, hyperparameters, and optimization algorithm.
4. Model evaluation and validation: After training the model, it is evaluated on a separate validation dataset to assess its performance. This involves calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
5. Model deployment and monitoring: Once the model has been trained and evaluated, it can be deployed to a production environment for use in making predictions or decisions. The model's performance should be monitored over time to ensure that it remains accurate and reliable.
