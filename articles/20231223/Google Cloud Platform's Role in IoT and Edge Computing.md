Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a comprehensive cloud computing platform that offers a wide range of services and tools for developers and businesses. It provides infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and serverless computing environments. GCP is designed to help organizations build, deploy, and scale applications, store and analyze data, and manage infrastructure.

In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing have emerged as two key technologies that are transforming the way we interact with the world around us. IoT refers to the interconnection of physical devices and sensors, while edge computing involves processing data closer to the source, reducing latency and improving efficiency.

This article will explore the role of GCP in IoT and edge computing, discussing the core concepts, algorithms, and techniques used in these technologies, as well as providing code examples and insights into the future of these fields.

## 2.核心概念与联系

### 2.1 IoT

IoT is a network of interconnected physical devices, vehicles, appliances, and other items embedded with sensors, software, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to collect and exchange data. The data collected by these devices can be used to monitor and control various aspects of our daily lives, such as energy consumption, transportation, healthcare, and security.
