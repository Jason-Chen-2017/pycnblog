Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing. In this guide, we will provide a step-by-step introduction to Jupyter Notebook, covering its installation, basic usage, and advanced features.

## 1.1. Brief History

Jupyter Notebook was originally developed as a project called "IJavascript" by Fernando Perez and his team at the University of California, Berkeley. The project aimed to create a web-based interface for the Python programming language. In 2011, the project was renamed to "Jupyter" and became an independent organization under the NumFOCUS umbrella. Since then, Jupyter has expanded to support multiple programming languages, including R, Julia, and Python.

## 1.2. Why Jupyter Notebook?

Jupyter Notebook offers several advantages over traditional text-based editors and integrated development environments (IDEs):

- **Interactive Computing**: Jupyter Notebook allows users to execute code cells interactively, making it an excellent tool for exploring data and prototyping algorithms.
- **Collaboration**: Jupyter Notebook supports real-time collaboration, enabling multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously.
- **Reproducibility**: Jupyter Notebooks are version-controlled documents, which means that users can track changes, compare different versions, and reproduce results.
- **Documentation**: Jupyter Notebooks can include Markdown cells, which allow users to add narrative text, images, and formatted equations to their documents.
- **Integration**: Jupyter Notebook integrates with various data sources and libraries, making it a versatile tool for data analysis and machine learning.

## 1.3. Jupyter Notebook vs. JupyterLab

Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab are two different user interfaces for Jupyter. While Jupyter Notebook is a simple, notebook-based interface, JupyterLab is a more advanced, IDE-like interface. JupyterLab offers additional features such as a file browser, customizable workspaces, and an extended command palette. In this guide, we will focus on Jupyter Notebook, but many of the concepts and techniques can be applied to JupyterLab as well.
