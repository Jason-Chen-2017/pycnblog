Amazon S3, or Simple Storage Service, is a scalable, high-speed, web-based cloud storage service. It allows users to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere.

#### 2.1.1 Core Concepts

- **Buckets**: A container for objects in S3. Each bucket is globally unique and must have a unique DNS-compliant name.
- **Objects**: Individual files stored in S3. Each object is made up of data and metadata.
- **Metadata**: Information about the object, such as its size, content type, and other attributes.

#### 2.1.2 How Amazon S3 Works

1. Create a bucket: Choose a unique name for your bucket and configure its settings.
2. Upload objects: Upload files to your bucket, either individually or in bulk.
3. Access objects: Retrieve objects from your bucket using the S3 API or a pre-signed URL.

### 2.2 Amazon EC2

Amazon EC2, or Elastic Compute Cloud, is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows users to launch virtual machines (VMs) and run applications on them.

#### 2.2.1 Core Concepts

- **Instances**: Virtual machines created in EC2. Each instance runs on a single Amazon EC2 compute instance.
- **AMIs**: Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) are templates that contain the information necessary to launch an instance.
- **Security Groups**: Virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic to instances.

#### 2.2.2 How Amazon EC2 Works

1. Choose an AMI: Select an AMI that contains the operating system and software needed for your application.
2. Configure an instance: Set up the instance settings, such as instance type, storage, and security groups.
3. Launch the instance: Start the instance and connect to it using SSH or RDP.

### 2.3 Amazon RDS

Amazon RDS is a managed database service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It supports several popular database engines, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.

- **Containers**: Packages that include everything needed to run a specific application, including code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.
- **Model**: A trained ML model that can be used to make predictions.

#### 2.4.2 How Amazon SageMaker Works

1. Create a Jupyter notebook: Set up a Jupyter notebook instance to write and run code.
2. Build a model: Use SageMaker's built-in algorithms or bring your own algorithm to train a model.
3. Deploy the model: Use SageMaker to deploy the trained model to a production environment.

### 2.5 Amazon Lambda

Amazon Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you.

#### 2.5.1 Core Concepts

- **Functions**: Small, single-purpose pieces of code that are triggered by events.
- **Event sources**: The triggers that invoke Lambda functions, such as API Gateway, S3, or DynamoDB.
- **Execution environment**: The runtime environment in which your code is executed.

#### 2.5.2 How Amazon Lambda Works

1. Create a function: Write a function in a supported language (e.g., Python, Node.js, Java) and configure its settings.
2. Set up an event source: Configure an event source to trigger the function when a specific event occurs.
3. Invoke the function: The function is automatically executed in response to the event.

### 2.6 Amazon DynamoDB

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.

#### 2.6.1 Core Concepts

- **Tables**: Containers for items in DynamoDB. Each table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each item.
- **Items**: Individual records stored in a table.
- **Attributes**: Fields within an item.

#### 2.6.2 How Amazon DynamoDB Works

1. Create a table: Define the table schema, including the primary key and any secondary indexes.
2. Add items: Insert items into the table using the DynamoDB API.
3. Query items: Retrieve items from the table using the DynamoDB API.

- **Producers**: Applications that generate and send data to Kinesis streams.
- **Consumers**: Applications that read and process data from Kinesis streams.

#### 2.7.2 How Amazon Kinesis Works

1. Create a stream: Define the stream settings, such as the shard count and data retention period.
2. Send data: Use a producer application to send data to the Kinesis stream.
3. Process data: Use a consumer application to read and process data from the Kinesis stream.

### 2.8 Amazon Redshift

Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service that makes it simple and cost-effective to analyze all your data using your existing business intelligence tools.

#### 2.8.1 Core Concepts

- **Clusters**: Groups of compute and storage resources that are used to process and store data.
- **Nodes**: Individual compute and storage resources within a cluster.
- **Spectrum**: A feature that allows you to run queries against data stored in Amazon S3.
