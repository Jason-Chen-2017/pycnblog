## 4.具体代码实例和详细解释说明
### 4.1 FoundationDB的具体代码实例
In this example, we will create a simple FoundationDB database and store some geospatial data in it.

```python
from foundationdb import FoundationDB

# Create a new FoundationDB database
db = FoundationDB()

# Store some geospatial data in the database
db.store("latitude", 37.7749)
db.store("longitude", -122.4194)
```

### 4.2 Geospatial数据的具体代码实例
In this example, we will create a simple geospatial data structure and query it using FoundationDB.

```python
from foundationdb import FoundationDB

# Create a new FoundationDB database
db = FoundationDB()

# Create a simple geospatial data structure
data = {
    "points": [
        {"latitude": 37.7749, "longitude": -122.4194},
        {"latitude": 37.7739, "longitude": -122.4184},
        {"latitude": 37.7729, "longitude": -122.4174},
    ],
    "lines": [
        {"latitude": 37.7749, "longitude": -122.4194, "latitude": 37.7739, "longitude": -122.4184},
        {"latitude": 37.7739, "longitude": -122.4184, "latitude": 37.7729, "longitude": -122.4174},
    ],
    "polygons": [
        {"latitude": 37.7749, "longitude": -122.4194, "latitude": 37.7739, "longitude": -122.4184, "latitude": 37.7729, "longitude": -122.4174},
    ],
}

# Query the geospatial data using FoundationDB
points = db.query("points")
lines = db.query("lines")
polygons = db.query("polygons")
```

### 4.3 FoundationDB与Geospatial数据的具体代码实例
In this example, we will create a simple FoundationDB database and store some geospatial data in it. We will then query the geospatial data using FoundationDB.

```python
from foundationdb import FoundationDB

# Create a new FoundationDB database
db = FoundationDB()

# Store some geospatial data in the database
db.store("latitude", 37.7749)
db.store("longitude", -122.4194)

# Query the geospatial data using FoundationDB
latitude = db.query("latitude")
longitude = db.query("longitude")
```
