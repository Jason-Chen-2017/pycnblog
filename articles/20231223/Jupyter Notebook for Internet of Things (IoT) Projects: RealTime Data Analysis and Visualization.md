# 4.具体代码实例和详细解释说明
# 4.1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
In this example, we will use the Python programming language to collect and preprocess data from a simulated IoT sensor.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Simulate IoT sensor data
data = {'timestamp': pd.date_range(start='2021-01-01', periods=100, freq='H'),
        'temperature': pd.Series(np.random.randn(100), index=data['timestamp']),
        'humidity': pd.Series(np.random.randint(0, 100, 100), index=data['timestamp'])}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

## 4.1.1. Data Cleaning
```python
# Remove duplicate entries
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

# Fill missing values
df.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)

# Remove extreme values
df = df[(df['temperature'] > -5) & (df['temperature'] < 5)]
```

## 4.1.2. Data Filtering
```python
# Select data points based on certain criteria
filtered_data = df[df['timestamp'] > '2021-01-01']
```

## 4.1.3. Data Transformation
```python
# Normalize data
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

scaler = MinMaxScaler()
df[['temperature', 'humidity']] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['temperature', 'humidity']])
```

# 4.2. Data Analysis
In this example, we will use the Python programming language to perform statistical analysis on the preprocessed data.

```python
# Calculate descriptive statistics
mean_temperature = df['temperature'].mean()
median_temperature = df['temperature'].median()
std_dev_temperature = df['temperature'].std()

# Perform hypothesis testing
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

ttest_result = ttest_ind(df['temperature'], df['temperature'])
