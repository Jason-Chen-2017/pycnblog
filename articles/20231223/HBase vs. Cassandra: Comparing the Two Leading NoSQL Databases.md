HBase and Cassandra are two of the most popular NoSQL databases. HBase is built on top of Hadoop and provides random read/write access to large datasets. Cassandra is a distributed database that provides high availability and fault tolerance. In this article, we will compare the two databases in terms of their architecture, data model, and use cases.

## 2.1 HBase

HBase is an open-source, distributed, versioned, non-relational database modeled after Google's Bigtable. It is built on top of Hadoop and provides random read/write access to large datasets. HBase is suitable for applications that require high write throughput and low latency reads.

### 2.1.1 Architecture

HBase is a distributed database, which means that it can scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster. HBase uses the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for storage, and it communicates with HDFS using the Hadoop FileSystem API. HBase also uses ZooKeeper for coordination and configuration management.

### 2.1.2 Data Model

HBase uses a column-family-centric data model. A table in HBase is composed of one or more column families. Each column family has its own set of columns and values. Columns are identified by a row key, a column qualifier, and a timestamp.

### 2.1.3 Use Cases

HBase is suitable for applications that require high write throughput and low latency reads. Some common use cases for HBase include:

- Log processing
- Real-time analytics
- Time-series data storage
- Machine learning

## 2.2 Cassandra

Cassandra is an open-source, distributed, wide-column store database. It is designed to provide high availability and fault tolerance. Cassandra is suitable for applications that require high write throughput, low latency reads, and high availability.

### 2.2.1 Architecture

Cassandra is a distributed database, which means that it can scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster. Cassandra uses the Cassandra File System (CFS) for storage. Cassandra also uses Gossiping Protocol for communication between nodes.

### 2.2.2 Data Model

Cassandra uses a wide-column data model. A table in Cassandra is composed of rows, columns, and values. Columns are identified by a row key and a column name.

### 2.2.3 Use Cases

Cassandra is suitable for applications that require high write throughput, low latency reads, and high availability. Some common use cases for Cassandra include:

- Web content management
- Gaming leaderboards
- Social networking
- IoT data storage

## 3. Core Algorithms and Operations

### 3.1 HBase Algorithms and Operations

HBase uses the HFile format for storage. HFile is a compact, self-indexing file format that is optimized for random read/write access. HBase also uses the MemStore and StoreFile data structures for caching and storage.

#### 3.1.1 MemStore

The MemStore is an in-memory data structure that caches recently written data. When data is written to HBase, it is first written to the MemStore. The MemStore is flushed to disk periodically, and the data is then stored in the StoreFile.

#### 3.1.2 StoreFile

The StoreFile is a on-disk data structure that stores persisted data. The StoreFile is composed of multiple regions. Each region contains a set of rows. Rows are identified by a row key, a column qualifier, and a timestamp.

#### 3.1.3 HBase Operations

HBase supports the following operations:

- Put: Adds a new row to a table.
- Get: Retrieves a row from a table.
- Scan: Reads all rows from a table.
- Delete: Deletes a row from a table.

### 3.2 Cassandra Algorithms and Operations

Cassandra uses the SSTable format for storage. SSTable is a log-structured merge-copy (LSM) tree-based file format that is optimized for random read/write access. Cassandra also uses the CommitLog and MemTable data structures for caching and storage.

#### 3.2.1 CommitLog

The CommitLog is an in-memory data structure that caches recently written data. When data is written to Cassandra, it is first written to the CommitLog. The CommitLog is flushed to disk periodically, and the data is then stored in the MemTable.

#### 3.2.2 MemTable

The MemTable is an in-memory data structure that stores persisted data. The MemTable is composed of multiple SSTables. Each SSTable contains a set of rows. Rows are identified by a row key and a column name.

#### 3.2.3 Cassandra Operations

Cassandra supports the following operations:

- Insert: Adds a new row to a table.
- Select: Retrieves a row from a table.
- Scan: Reads all rows from a table.
- Delete: Deletes a row from a table.

## 4. Code Examples

### 4.1 HBase Code Example

```python
from hbase import Hbase

# Connect to HBase
hbase = Hbase('localhost', 9090)

# Create a new table
hbase.create_table('mytable', {'columns': ['column1', 'column2']})

# Insert a new row
hbase.put('mytable', 'row1', {'column1': 'value1', 'column2': 'value2'})

# Retrieve a row
row = hbase.get('mytable', 'row1')
print(row)

# Scan all rows
rows = hbase.scan('mytable')
for row in rows:
    print(row)

# Delete a row
hbase.delete('mytable', 'row1')
```

### 4.2 Cassandra Code Example

```python
from cassandra.cluster import Cluster

# Connect to Cassandra
cluster = Cluster(['localhost'])
session = cluster.connect()

# Create a new table
session.execute('''
    CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS mykeyspace
    WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1}
''')
session.execute('''
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mykeyspace.mytable (
        row_key text,
        column1 text,
        column2 text,
        PRIMARY KEY (row_key)
    )
''')

# Insert a new row
session.execute('''
    INSERT INTO mykeyspace.mytable (row_key, column1, column2)
    VALUES ('row1', 'value1', 'value2')
''')

# Retrieve a row
row = session.execute('''
    SELECT * FROM mykeyspace.mytable WHERE row_key = 'row1'
''')
print(row)

# Scan all rows
rows = session.execute('''
    SELECT * FROM mykeyspace.mytable
''')
for row in rows:
    print(row)

# Delete a row
session.execute('''
    DELETE FROM mykeyspace.mytable WHERE row_key = 'row1'
''')
```
