### 1.1. Background Introduction

Binary classification is a fundamental problem in machine learning and data挖掘. It involves classifying data into two different categories based on a single feature or characteristic. Support vector machines (SVMs) are one of the most popular machine learning algorithms for binary classification. In this article, we will explore the implementation of CatBoost, an ensemble learning framework based on SVMs for binary classification.

### 1.2. Article Purpose

The purpose of this article is to provide a detailed guide on how to implement CatBoost for binary classification using support vector machines. We will cover the technical原理, implementation steps, and an application example. By the end of this article, readers will have a clear understanding of how to use CatBoost for binary classification and how to troubleshoot common issues.

### 1.3. Target Audience

This article is targeted at developers, software架构师, and data scientists who are familiar with the basics of machine learning and data挖掘. It is essential to have a good understanding of SVMs and their applications in binary classification. While the article will cover the technical details, it is assumed that readers have a basic understanding of the concepts.
