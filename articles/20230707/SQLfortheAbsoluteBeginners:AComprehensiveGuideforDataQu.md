SQL for the Absolute Beginners: A Comprehensive Guide for Data Querying
==========================================================================

Introduction
------------

1.1. Background Introduction
-----------------------------

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for managing relational databases. It is used to insert, retrieve, update and delete data in a database. As a language that has been widely used for many years, SQL has a rich set of features and functions that make it an essential tool for data analysis and querying. However, for those who are new to SQL, the language can be overwhelming and difficult to understand. This guide aims to provide a comprehensive guide for data querying using SQL for beginners.

1.2. Article Purpose
------------------

The purpose of this guide is to provide an in-depth understanding of SQL for beginners. The article will cover the basic concepts of SQL, its technology underlying principles, and the steps involved in data querying using SQL. Additionally, the article will provide practical guidance on how to implement SQL queries in a database and include examples of code snippets to help readers understand the concepts.

1.3. Target Audience
--------------------

This guide is intended for individuals who are new to SQL and data querying. It is particularly aimed at those who are looking to learn SQL in order to perform data analysis or who are working in a field that requires them to use SQL.

Technical Principles and Concepts
-----------------------------

2.1. Basic Concepts
--------------

SQL is a language that is used for managing relational databases. A relational database is a type of database that is organized into tables, rows, and columns. Each table has a unique set of columns and rows, and each row in a table corresponds to a single record in the table.

A SQL query is a statement that is used to retrieve data from a database. It consists of a SELECT statement and a list of columns that the data should include in the result. The SELECT statement specifies the columns that should be included in the result, and the data is retrieved from the database based on the conditions in the query.

2.2. Technological Principles
----------------------

SQL is built on top of a set of technical principles that are designed to ensure the consistency and reliability of data in a database. These principles include:

* The use of a declarative language: SQL is a declarative language, which means that it is used to specify the desired results of a query rather than the specific steps that should be taken to achieve those results.
* The use of a query language: SQL is a query language, which means that it is used to specify the steps that should be taken to retrieve data from a database.
* The use of a data engine: SQL is executed by a data engine, which is responsible for retrieving the data from the database and returning it to the user.
* The use of a transaction: SQL supports the use of transactions, which allow data to be retrieved and updated in a single unit of work.

2.3. SQL Queries
--------------

SQL queries are used to retrieve data from a database. A SQL query consists of a SELECT statement and a list of columns that the data should include in the result.

A SELECT statement specifies the columns that should be included in the result, and the data is retrieved from the database based on the conditions in the query.

For example, the following SQL query retrieves all columns and rows from a table called "employees":
```
SELECT * FROM employees;
```
This query will return all columns and rows from the "employees" table.

SQL also supports the use of SQL
