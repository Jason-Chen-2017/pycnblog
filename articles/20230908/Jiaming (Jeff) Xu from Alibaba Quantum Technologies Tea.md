# 2.基本概念、术语和定义
## 2.1 量子态（Quantum State）
In quantum mechanics, a quantum state refers to the complete wave function describing all possible configurations of subatomic particles and electrons within an isolated system called a quantum system. The basic unit of quantum mechanics are kets or bras, which represent states of a single particle or electron. A product state is represented by a tensor product of individual basis vectors, while a tensor product state consists of several different bra-ket pairs. Together, these states define the entire wavefunction of the quantum system. In general terms, a quantum system can be in one of many quantum states at any given time, depending on the input applied to its environment.
The concept of quantum state can have a wide range of interpretations. For example, it could refer to the initial conditions of a system, or to the output of a measurement process performed on a particular system. However, in modern quantum computing, the term "state" generally refers specifically to the exact wavefunction of a quantum system, rather than simply being a snapshot of the system at a specific point in time. As such, we will use this definition of quantum state throughout our article.

## 2.2 量子比特（Quantum Bit）或量子门（Quantum Gate）
A quantum bit is a qubit or qudit made up of two or more levels of existence that behave like classical bits. These qubits operate independently and interact with each other through quantum gates. Qubits can manipulate quantum states by applying transformations such as creation and annihilation operators. They also encode binary data into polarization or spin projections of their eigenstates. In quantum computing, we typically treat qubits as either coherent or entangled with other qubits to perform computations on quantum information and communications. 

## 2.3 量子纠缠（Quantum Entanglement）
Quantum entanglement refers to the situation where two or more quantum objects are linked together such that they cannot be described independently. This happens when the correlations between them become too strong due to interactions with their environment, making them behave differently even though they possess identical quantum properties. By exhibiting quantum entanglement, quantum systems can remain highly interconnected over long periods of time without disrupting their fundamental structure. Quantum entanglement makes quantum computing particularly interesting because it provides the opportunity for parallel processing, distributed communication, and probabilistic calculations that are difficult or impossible in traditional digital circuitry. It also allows for novel methods of encryption, error correction, and storage.

Entanglement can occur between coherently interacting qubits, or between one or more qubits and classical information. An example of classical entanglement would involve sending a message encoded in a classical language through quantum links. Another type of entanglement involves spontaneous emission of photons in the presence of light, creating the phenomenon of entangled photons. Both types of entanglement contribute to the emergence of quantum technology as a powerful tool for exploring and manipulating physical systems.
