# 3.Core concepts and terms in Accounting

1. Business Finance
	- Business finance refers to the financial planning, analysis, and control of business activities related to a company's operations. It is responsible for managing all aspects of the organization's financial structure, including acquisition costs, capital expenditures, expenses, income, cash flows, revenue projections, liquidity management, risk management, and governance structures. 

2. Cash Flow Analysis
	- Cash flow analysis (CFA) is an accounting technique that helps companies identify sources of profitability, manage cash flow through the company's accounts, and anticipate future cash needs based on economic trends and market conditions. CFA involves analyzing how money enters or leaves the company, as well as identifying ways to reduce or increase cash flows over time. 

3. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) Accounting 
	- COGS accountants analyze the cost basis of goods sold by a business by tracking its inventory, purchases, sales, overhead costs, insurance premiums, suppliers' commissions, and other factors associated with producing, transporting, and selling items within the company. They also review financial statements to determine the fair value of assets sold. 

4. Financial Statement Analysis
	- A financial statement analysis provides detailed information about a company's financial position and performance over a given period. This includes identifying any issues related to operating procedures, financial strength, and regulatory compliance. The process may involve gathering data from various sources such as transaction records, balance sheets, and profit and loss statements. 

5. Fiscal Policy
	- The fiscal policy determines what funds are available to the government and what lending programs are allowed to be conducted. The main purpose of the fiscal policy is to set reasonable boundaries for spending and strengthen institutional support for businesses. 

6. Income Statements
	- An income statement is a report generated by a company that shows how much revenue it has earned during a specific period and how much each source of revenue contributed to the overall revenue. These reports show how the business has made money while highlighting any potential areas for improvement. 

7. Liquidity Ratio
	- The liquidity ratio measures how secure a company's current financial resources are against its ability to generate additional revenues or decrease existing expenses without compromising the interest of customers. 

8. Management Reporting Framework
	- The management reporting framework outlines the core principles, key metrics, and guidance for effective management reporting. It includes best practices for developing a consistent approach to financial reporting, guiding staff towards appropriate reporting formats and deliverables, and establishing clear communication channels between stakeholders. 

9. Profit and Loss Statement
	- A profit and loss statement is a comprehensive record of a company's financial results during a particular period. It shows the amount of profits, losses, and gains derived from the company's business activity and highlights any areas where the company can improve its earnings. 

# 4.Techniques and tools used in Accounting

1. Asset Allocation Analysis
	- Asset allocation analysis involves breaking down a business into its constituent parts and determining how they contribute to the total profitability of the enterprise. This helps managers understand which departments need more investment or restructuring, and therefore require greater attention when it comes to investing and/or reorganizing their business units. 

2. Balance Sheet Auditing
	- A balance sheet audit examines whether a company's financial positions have been accurately calculated according to the most recent financial statements. Companies often make mistakes in calculating balances due to errors in accounting entries, incorrect assumptions, or misunderstanding of business processes. 

3. Budgeting and Forecasting
	- Budgeting and forecasting play important roles in ensuring that a company maintains a healthy financial position and remains competitive in the global economy. A well-designed budget ensures that the necessary resources are allocated effectively to different priorities throughout the year. 

4. Capital Expenditure Review
	- Capital expenditure review involves assessing the efficiency of a company's capital expenditures and reducing unnecessary ones. This can include reviewing contracts for purchase of new equipment, depreciation, and improvements that do not provide added value to the company. 

5. Cash Management
	- Cash management is essential to maintaining a healthy financial environment and keeping pace with changes in inflation. It involves monitoring cash flow to ensure that there are no surprises or delays in the payment of bills or loans. Achieving this requires careful management of cash inflows and outflows through proper spending controls. 

6. Credit Rating
	- Credit ratings are assigned by lenders to ensure that borrowers receive reliable credit and help them make better decisions regarding their loan applications. When performing credit rating checks, businesses should seek expertise from leading financial advisors who can evaluate a company's risks and opportunities and provide a credible assessment. 

7. Debt Relief
	- Debt relief is the process of paying off a company's debts to avoid default on future loans or obligations. The goal is to minimize the negative impact that defaulters might experience if defaults occur. 

8. Economic Valuation Methodology
	- Economic valuation methods measure the worth of a company using various techniques such as market analysis, price-to-earnings ratios, discount rates, and fundamental analysis. Most of these methods rely on past data to estimate the future value of a company and predict its growth over time. 

9. Interest Coverage Ratios
	- Interest coverage ratios measure the extent to which a company can cover its interest payments on debt. While higher values indicate a stronger ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet, lower values could pose a problem if they result in delinquency or foreclosure. 

10. Intangibles - Goodwill and Intangible Assets
	- Goodwill is the right to use one's own name, image, good ideas, and intangibles in business. It represents the bond that binds two people together despite their differences and gives them both ownership in the same business entity. Intangible assets refer to anything that cannot be easily measured like knowledge, skills, expertise, or IP rights.

11. Inventory Management
	- Inventory management involves organizing a company's raw materials, finished products, and work-in-progress so that they are properly stored and handled. This plays a crucial role in controlling inventory levels and minimizing wastage and production errors. 

12. Marketing Mix Model
	- A marketing mix model uses statistical methods to explore the relationship between marketing strategies, brand perceptions, customer preferences, and revenue generation. Marketers can then target specific segments and promote them accordingly, resulting in increased sales and improved profitability. 

13. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation
	- NPV calculation is an essential component of financial analysis that estimates the present value of expected future cash flows. It is widely used in project management, pension funding, and personal finance. Using NPV analysis, organizations can compare their actual cash flow benefits versus those projected based on their future financial plan. 

14. Payback Period Calculation
	- The payback period is the length of time required to recover all of a company's initial investments after making periodic investments over time. This can be useful for evaluating the long-term profitability of a company and helping to inform decision-making. 

15. Payment Decisions
	- Payment decisions represent a company's strategic move towards meeting recurring financial obligations, such as rent or mortgage payments. Choosing the optimal payment frequency and amount can significantly affect the company's profitability and financial stability. 

16. Pricing Strategies
	- Pricing strategies aim at understanding how consumers will respond to a product or service and choosing pricing models accordingly. Different pricing strategies can lead to positive or negative outcomes depending on the nature of the product being promoted. 

17. Revenue Projections
	- Revenue projections examine the potential earnings, margins, and growth for a business in upcoming years. Estimating revenue ahead of time can help to prevent unexpected financial losses. 

18. Risk Management
	- Risk management involves mitigating threats to the financial health of a company and prioritizing actions that can limit or reverse their effects. This typically involves analyzing risk profiles, evaluating internal and external threats, and formulating plans for dealing with risks. 

19. Working Capital Management
	- Working capital management involves allocating sufficient cash on hand to meet the short-term needs of a business while taking into account the longer-term challenges faced by the business. It involves managing financial constraints and balancing risk and reward within the limits imposed by business objectives.
