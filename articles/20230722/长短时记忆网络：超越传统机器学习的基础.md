长短时记忆网络（LSTM）是一种改进的RNN（循环神经网络），可以更好地解决序列数据的处理问题，特别是在文本、时间序列数据等场景下。因此，这项工作具有颠覆性和广阔的前景。本文将从以下三个方面入手，探讨LSTM及其在机器学习领域的应用：

## 2.1 Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs), also known as Elman networks or Vanilla RNNs, are neural network architectures that use a feedback loop to propagate information through time in sequences of inputs. These networks have been used in areas such as speech recognition, text prediction and machine translation. In an RNN, the output at each step is based on the input from all previous steps, including the current timestep. The hidden state of the network is preserved between these updates using additional connections. The goal of the model is to learn how to accurately predict future outputs given a sequence of inputs.

In traditional RNNs, the memory cell is not updated with new data until it has been completely processed by the preceding layers. This results in the model being unable to remember long-term dependencies between events in the sequence. Long short term memory (LSTM) is one type of recurrent unit that addresses this limitation. 

Long short-term memory cells maintain two internal states: the “cell” state and the “hidden” state. Both of them are initially set to zero vectors but change over time based on the inputs and previous states. The cell state acts like a memory store for storing information over long periods of time while the hidden state provides a summary representation of the most recent relevant information in the cell. The key difference between LSTMs and standard RNNs lies in their ability to retain longer-term contextual relationships amongst multiple timesteps during training.

## 2.2 Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a special kind of RNN layer designed to address some of the limitations of traditional RNNs when working with sequential data. It consists of four interacting gate mechanisms that control the flow of information into and out of the cell state. Each gate can be thought of as a filter that either allows or blocks certain types of information from passing through the connection. This makes the LSTM more flexible than traditional RNNs because it can choose which parts of the sequence to pay attention to and ignore irrelevant details. Additionally, LSTMs have proven to be very effective in handling tasks such as language modeling, speech recognition and image captioning.

The gating mechanism inside an LSTM cell includes three components:

1. Forget Gate: Controls how much of the old cell state is forgotten at each update.
2. Input Gate: Controls how much of the new input is added to the cell state.
3. Output Gate: Controls how much of the cell state is allowed to pass on to the next layer.

Each component takes a weighted sum of its inputs and passes it through a sigmoid activation function to get a value between 0 and 1. If the result is close to 1, then the gate is open; if it's close to 0, then the gate is closed. The forget gate controls how quickly the cell state forgets previously learned information about the input sequence, whereas the input gate determines how much new information is added to the cell state. Finally, the output gate decides what to do with the final cell state before it is sent to the next layer in the network.

To add more complexity to the system, there are also peephole connections that allow individual gates to directly influence the overall cell state. Overall, LSTMs provide a powerful tool for processing sequential data and achieving high accuracy in many applications.

## 2.3 Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) are similar to LSTMs but simpler compared to standard RNNs. They contain only two gates - reset gate and update gate - instead of four gates in LSTMs. Similarly, they both rely on updating the cell state with new information from the input and the previous hidden state using a tanh activation function. However, unlike LSTMs, GRUs don't include the cell state itself as an explicit memory store and thus require less computational resources. Overall, GRUs are faster and computationally cheaper than LSTMs but still offer good performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks.

Overall, we see that LSTMs and GRUs are central components of modern deep learning models in areas ranging from natural language processing to computer vision. Despite these advances, they're still considered "black boxes," making it difficult for non-experts to understand exactly how they work internally. By explaining these concepts in simple terms, we hope to inspire other researchers to further explore these powerful techniques in their own domains.
