“What is artificial intelligence?”——“Artificial Intelligence Is Now a Cultural Concept in Modern Society”. This article explores the meaning of “AI” as it applies to modern society and what this means for its role within culture. AI has become an important topic of conversation in the past few years and continues to be discussed across cultures. However, how does our understanding of AI relate to other aspects of culture, such as values, traditions, identity, power, and institutions? How do different cultures view and interpret AI differently, creating biases and perpetuating patterns of misunderstanding? And more questions arise along these lines: What are the fundamental principles guiding human behavior towards achieving AI objectives, and why do some cultures adopt certain technical solutions over others? 

In order to gain a comprehensive perspective on the way we understand and interact with AI today, I propose exploring four key areas related to AI culture: ethics, values, beliefs, and norms. These areas provide a framework for developing new perspectives on how to better understand and design AI systems that promote human wellbeing and achieve long-term sustainability. To approach this question, I will present my research contributions through case studies and literature reviews that address specific challenges and opportunities unique to AI in various contexts. Finally, I hope that by examining cultures around the world and comparing them to each other, we can create a deeper understanding of how culture influences and shapes our interactions with technology and ultimately shape the future of humanity’s relationship with machines.

2.1 概览

“What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?” was a widely discussed and debated question in recent years. Much attention went into defining exactly what the term meant, and the consequences for people involved. Despite their importance and practicality, most discussions centered around narrow definitions or generalizations. One major challenge faced in providing a comprehensive definition is that there is no consensus among scholars on what constitutes AI itself. Although there have been several attempts at unifying the concepts, none of them offer a clear answer yet. With the advent of deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNN), artificial intelligence has become increasingly complex and adaptive, becoming a hinderance rather than a help when trying to solve real-world problems. 

2.2 分类方法

Several approaches have been taken to categorize the current state of AI research:

1. Supervised Learning: Traditionally, supervised learning involves training models using labeled data where the output of the model is based on input features. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a function that maps inputs to outputs given some training examples, which can then be used to make predictions about new, previously unseen inputs. In practice, there exist many applications of supervised learning, including image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modeling.

2. Unsupervised Learning: Unsupervised learning, also known as clustering or density estimation, involves finding patterns in unlabeled data without any prior knowledge. The goal of unsupervised learning is to discover structures or clusters in the data without being specifically told what they should look like ahead of time. Applications include anomaly detection, summarization, and recommendation systems.

3. Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement learning aims to train agents to perform tasks by taking actions in an environment and receiving feedback. It enables autonomous agents to learn from their mistakes and improve their performance over time. Robotic applications, such as robotics control and navigation, video games, and virtual assistants, are popular fields of reinforcement learning.

4. Generative Models: A generative model generates new samples from a set of input variables. Unlike traditional machine learning algorithms, generative models typically use probabilistic methods to generate multiple possible outcomes, enabling the system to capture and spread the complexity of the underlying distribution. Examples of generative models include variational autoencoders and GANs.

It is important to note that not all categories overlap completely and some subcategories may be complementary to one another. For example, there exists a growing focus on reinforcement learning, but both supervised and unsupervised learning are often applied to build RL systems. Similarly, unsupervised learning is focused on identifying patterns in the data without any prescribed structure while generative models try to learn to produce novel samples that could not have existed in the original dataset. Overall, there is still much work left to be done in AI to bridge the gap between theoretical and practical developments. 

2.3 人工智能应用与价值评估

Despite the rapid development of AI technologies, the application of AI has seen limited emphasis until recently. There are two main reasons behind this:

1. Lack of reliable metrics: Machine learning models require large amounts of labeled data and can only make accurate predictions if the quality of the training data is high. As a result, evaluating the accuracy of AI models requires carefully designed evaluation procedures and metrics. Without rigorous evaluation, it becomes difficult to establish whether an AI system is actually contributing to positive social impact or advancing societal goals.

2. Inadequate privacy and security considerations: Many AI applications involve sensitive information that needs to be protected, such as personal health records or financial transactions. Unfortunately, there is no standardized methodology for handling personal data securely and efficiently, leaving organizations vulnerable to data breaches, hackings, and identity theft.

To advance the field of AI, government agencies and industry players need to prioritize building robust and trustworthy models that handle sensitive information appropriately and accurately. Ultimately, however, governments must act collectively to ensure that AI technology benefits public interests and meets public expectations. In contrast, industries need to conduct thorough due diligence before entering into contracts with citizens and governments to protect user data and implement ethical guidelines. Moreover, businesses, researchers, and policymakers need to come together to identify potential risks associated with the usage of AI and develop appropriate policies, mechanisms, and practices to safeguard user data.
