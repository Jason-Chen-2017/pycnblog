        Dynamic memory networks (DMN) are a type of neural network that was introduced in 2016 by Kim et al.[1] They were specifically designed to handle sequential data and enable long-term memory for reasoning tasks such as sentiment analysis or question answering. 

        The DMN is composed of two main components: a content addressable memory unit and an attention mechanism between the input sequence and the memory. The former stores information retrieved from external sources, while the latter controls how much information should be focused on based on its relevance to the current context. 

        In this article, we will explore more deeply into how these concepts work in DMN using a practical example. We will first introduce some background concepts related to time, dynamic memory networks, and natural language processing (NLP). Then we will focus on explaining what is meant by reasoning about concepts as they evolve over time using DMN. Finally, we will demonstrate step-by-step how to use DMN for sentiment analysis and implement it in Python.
        
        # 2.Background Introduction

        ## Natural Language Processing (NLP) Background

          NLP is the field of computational linguistics that focuses on enabling machines to understand human languages. It has become one of the most active research areas in the past decade due to its applications in various fields including computer vision, speech recognition, and machine translation. In particular, NLP plays an essential role in information retrieval systems where text needs to be analyzed and understood to provide relevant results. However, when dealing with sequential data like text, traditional NLP techniques can lead to biases which limit their performance. Therefore, there have been many works trying to improve the performance of NLP models through incorporating knowledge from both syntax and semantics of sentences. One popular technique is called syntactic parsing which involves breaking down the sentence into smaller parts, establishing relationships between them, and identifying the grammatical structure of the sentence. Another approach is called semantic parsing where each word in the sentence is assigned a meaning according to its context within the whole sentence. These methods allow the model to better interpret the sentence's intent and carry out complex operations like dialogues and multi-turn conversations.
          
          Recently, deep learning models have shown impressive performance in handling sequential data and have emerged as the preferred choice for NLP problems. Some of the popular deep learning architectures used for NLP include convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), transformers, and graph neural networks (GNN).
          
        ## Time Background

          Time is at the core of our everyday lives. From traffic signals to stock market prices, everything we do and experience is influenced by time. Every decision we make, every action we take, is dependent on the passage of time. This makes us susceptible to variations in time ranging from daylight saving time changes to seasonal trends. 
           
          Most modern societies live in times of globalization, where people across cultures interact with each other and share cultural ideas and values. As a result, countries like China, Russia, and India have pushed forward efforts towards coordinating their public holidays and religious festivals to synchronize their calendars. While this has led to improvements in communication and mobility during those times, it also poses new challenges for businesses, politics, and economics who depend on accurate predictions of future events. 
          
          Computer science has made significant advances in modeling time series data. By analyzing large amounts of historical data, machine learning algorithms can predict future events based on patterns and trends in the data. One common application of time series prediction is predicting the sales of a product or company based on historical sales data. Techniques like ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average) and Holt-Winters forecasting algorithm can help determine the general direction of the time series data and identify any patterns or cyclical behavior that may affect sales. However, these models require large datasets and domain expertise to build accurate predictions.
           
          
       ## Dynamic Memory Networks

       Dynamic memory networks (DMNs) are a family of neural networks that were introduced by Kim et al.[1]. They are particularly suited for reasoning tasks that involve long-term memory and sequential data. Examples of these tasks include sentiment analysis, fact verification, and question answering. DMN consists of two main components - a content-addressable memory unit and an attention mechanism.

           ### Content Addressable Memory Unit
           
             A key feature of DMN is its content-addressable memory unit. This component retrieves stored memories based on the input pattern rather than storing the entire sequence directly. This enables the network to retain only the important aspects of the input, thus reducing the amount of redundant information stored in memory.
             
             For instance, consider a news article discussing an election that had just concluded. If the same article were to be presented again after several years, the network would still need to remember details pertaining to the previous election but not repeat all the previously discussed points. This helps ensure that the network retains critical insights and does not become confused or distracted by irrelevant information.

           ### Attention Mechanism

           The second component of DMN is the attention mechanism. This component determines which parts of the input sequence should be prioritized for retrieving information from memory. Moreover, the attention mechanism dynamically adapts itself to the changing context of the conversation, ensuring that the network stays focused on the relevant information.

           To illustrate how attention mechanism works in DMN, let’s consider the following scenario: Suppose you want to ask a question to your friend. You start by introducing yourself and stating your problem statement. Your friend then reads your message and begins answering questions. During this process, the attention mechanism adjusts its focus to keep track of the questions being asked and answers being given. Once the conversation moves beyond certain topics, the attention mechanism switches back to maintaining focus on the original topic until the conversation ends. Thus, the attention mechanism ensures that the network stays attentive to the conversation happening and remains aware of the latest updates in real-time.
       
       Now that we have covered some basic background concepts in NLP and time, let’s move onto the practical side of things by applying DMN to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews.
