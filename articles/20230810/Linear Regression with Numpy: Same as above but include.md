# 1.简介
         
 Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to estimate the relationship between a set of input variables and corresponding output variables. It is one of the most commonly used algorithms in data science, and it has many practical applications such as predicting sales or demand based on weather patterns, predicting customer behavior, and predicting stock prices. In this article, we will learn about linear regression using Python and its built-in library NumPy. We will also cover some basic concepts such as mean squared error (MSE) and coefficient of determination (R^2).

          ## 2.1 Linear Regression
          The goal of linear regression is to model the relationship between a scalar dependent variable $y$ and one or more explanatory variables $\mathbf{x}$, which are denoted by the Greek letter "X". The estimated model should have a good fit so that it accurately predicts the values of the dependent variable when given new inputs. The best way to measure how well the model fits the data is through the Mean Squared Error (MSE), which represents the average of the squares of the differences between predicted values and actual values:

          $$
          MSE = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
          $$

          where $n$ is the number of observations, $(\hat{y}_i)$ is the predicted value of $y$ for observation $i$, and $(y_i)$ is the true value of $y$. When there is only one independent variable ($\mathbf{x}$ is a scalar), the model equation is given by:

          $$
          y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon
          $$

          where $\beta_0$ is the intercept term, $\beta_1$ is the slope term, and $\epsilon$ is the random error term. The optimal solution for these coefficients involves minimizing the sum of squared errors (SSE):

          $$
          SSE = \sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - (\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i))^2
          $$

          Once we find the optimal parameters, we can use them to make predictions on new data points. The formula for prediction at any point $x'$ is:

          $$
          \hat{y}' = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x'
          $$

          ## 2.2 Mean Squared Error (MSE)
          To minimize the sum of squared errors (SSE) or the MSE, we need to update the coefficients $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$. One approach is to calculate the gradients of the objective function with respect to each parameter, which gives us the direction in which to move if we want to reduce the cost. This direction is given by the negative gradient. However, calculating the gradients requires taking derivatives, which can be computationally intensive. Instead, we can approximate the gradients using stochastic gradient descent (SGD), an iterative optimization technique that takes small steps towards the minimum of the objective function along the steepest direction until convergence. The size of the step taken is determined by a hyperparameter called the learning rate. At each iteration, we subtract a fraction of the gradient times the learning rate from the current parameters to minimize the loss. After a fixed number of iterations, we can consider the model converged and stop further updates. 

          If our dataset contains missing values or other outliers, we may encounter problems with the calculation of the derivative, resulting in instability or slow convergence. Therefore, we typically add a regularization term to the objective function that penalizes large coefficients. Common choices include L1 regularization, which encourages sparsity, and L2 regularization, which encourages smaller coefficients. Regularization can help prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model becomes too complex due to too many degrees of freedom or when the training data is insufficiently representative of the underlying process. 

          Another important concept in linear regression is the R-squared metric, which measures how much of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the model's input features. Specifically, R-squared is equal to 1 minus the ratio of the residual sum of squares (RSS) divided by the total sum of squares (TSS):

          $$
          R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{RSS}}{\text{TSS}}
          $$

          Where RSS is defined as the sum of squared errors and TSS is the total variation in the dependent variable. A higher R-squared indicates better fit and a lower R-squared suggests worse fit. 

          ## 2.3 Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$)
          Another way to evaluate the performance of a linear regression model is to compare its predictions against the actual outcomes. The coefficient of determination, also known as R-squared, provides a single number summary of the quality of the fit of the model:

           $$
           R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{SSR}}{\text{SST}} = 1 - \frac{\text{Sum of Squares Residual}}{\text{Total Sum of Squares}}
           $$
           
           Here, $\text{SSR}$ stands for the sum of squared errors (errors that are not caused by bias or variability in the model itself) and $\text{SST}$ stands for the total sum of squares (the amount of variation in the outcome variable that cannot be attributed to statistical noise or bias in the model). The closer R-squared gets to 1, the better the model fits the data.
          
          ## 2.4 Summary 
          In conclusion, linear regression is a powerful tool for modeling relationships between multiple variables. It works by finding the line of best fit that minimizes the sum of squared errors between the predicted and observed values of the dependent variable. Several techniques exist for handling outliers, missing values, and non-linear relationships. NumPy is a popular library for performing numerical computing tasks in Python and makes working with matrices and arrays simpler than traditional approaches.
