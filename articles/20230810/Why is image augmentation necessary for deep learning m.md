## Introduction of Image Augmentation
>In computer vision tasks such as object detection or classification, the training data are usually limited due to various reasons such as low quality images, insufficient quantity, etc. In this case, it becomes critical for us to utilize additional unlabeled data sources that have similar characteristics but different variations to increase our dataset size effectively. However, gathering large volumes of new data can be expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, automated techniques have been proposed for generating synthetic data by transforming existing ones in a way that appears natural but does not contain any realistic information. These techniques include geometric transformations like rotation, scaling, flipping, shearing, cropping, blurring, contrast adjustment, noise injection, etc., and color distortions like gamma correction, hue shifting, brightness adjustments, saturation changes, contrast adjustments, etc.

However, most of these methods require manual intervention and cannot generate very diverse data since they only perform small perturbations on each input image. To overcome these limitations, some researchers propose using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create highly varied and complex synthetically generated samples. GANs consist of two neural networks: one is called discriminator that estimates the probability of an image being real or fake while the other is called generator that generates images from random noises. The discriminator learns to distinguish between real and synthetic data based on their features and outputs a binary prediction indicating whether the input image is authentic or artificially created. During training, both networks work collaboratively to minimize the difference between the predicted probabilities of real and synthetic images which encourages the generator to produce more realistic and diverse samples. 

With the development of powerful hardware capabilities such as graphics processing units (GPUs), GANs have become increasingly popular for creating high-quality synthetic images. However, even with efficient architectures and high-performance GPUs, it is still challenging to train complex deep neural networks on large datasets consisting of millions of labeled examples. This is because of two main factors:

1. Training typically requires multiple passes through the entire dataset, making it computationally intensive and slow.
2. Models must be trained efficiently enough to converge without overfitting to avoid introducing bias and underfitting.

To address these challenges, researchers have developed several strategies for optimizing the model's performance and reducing computational cost during training: 

1. Data augmentation techniques used to improve generalization capability and reduce overfitting, where the original dataset is modified through randomly applying various operations including translations, rotations, and flips, resulting in multiple versions of the same image. 
2. Regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting such as dropout regularization, weight decay, and early stopping.
3. Transfer learning techniques utilized when the target task has significantly less labeled data than the source task to leverage pre-trained models on related domains.

In summary, modern approaches to solving problems related to deep learning require careful design choices along with effective optimization algorithms and data preprocessing procedures to obtain accurate and reliable results. With image augmentation, we can efficiently apply a series of transformation operations to enhance the diversity and complexity of our dataset while keeping its original distribution and structure unchanged, leading to significant improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of deep neural network models. Moreover, image augmentation enables us to build more sophisticated models capable of handling large amounts of data without extensive hyperparameter tuning and computational resources.
