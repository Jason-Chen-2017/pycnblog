Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been proven to be very effective in image recognition tasks such as object detection, classification, and segmentation. They are mainly used in computer vision applications where they can extract features from the input images and learn how these features relate to specific classes or objects within an image.

In this article we will build a CNN using TensorFlow library in Python programming language to classify different types of animals in various datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Fashion MNIST, and ImageNet dataset. We will also compare our model's accuracy against other state-of-the-art models on those same datasets. This article assumes that you are familiar with basic concepts of deep learning and neural networks. If not, please review them before proceeding further. 

To follow along with this tutorial, you need to install Python 3.x and TensorFlow 2+ libraries. You also need to download CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Fashion MNIST, and/or ImageNet datasets depending on which ones you want to use. After downloading the datasets, place them into separate folders named "cifar-10", "cifar-100", "fashion_mnist", and "imagenet" respectively under the current directory. 

This tutorial is divided into several sections:
- Section 2: Basic Concepts of Convolutional Neural Networks
- Section 3: Preprocessing Data
- Section 4: Defining Architecture of Our Model
- Section 5: Training and Evaluating Our Model
- Section 6: Comparing Our Model Performance Against Other State-Of-The-Art Models
- Section 7: Conclusion

Let's get started!


## Prerequisites
Before starting out with this tutorial, it's important to understand some fundamental concepts of convolutional neural networks and their implementation details. Here are a few things that you should know about:

1. **What is a Convolutional Neural Network?**

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network designed specifically for processing visual data. It consists of multiple layers, each performing a specialized function such as detecting edges, identifying patterns, classifying objects, etc. The key idea behind CNNs is the concept of convolution, which involves sliding filters over the input data and computing dot products between the filter outputs and weights. The resulting feature maps obtained by applying multiple filters over the input data capture interesting features present in the original input data. 

2. **What are Convolutional Layers?**

A convolutional layer applies filters to the input data in order to produce feature maps. Each filter produces one feature map, which is typically smaller than the input data. There are two main types of convolutional layers:

1. Conv2D: This layer applies a 2-dimensional convolutional filter to the input data.
2. MaxPooling2D: This layer reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps produced by the previous conv2d layer, thereby downsampling the output.

3. **How do Pooling Operations Work?**

Pooling operations reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps by summarizing the most relevant information in the neighboring pixels. Two common pooling methods are max pooling and average pooling. In max pooling, the maximum value in the pool is selected from all the values in the pool; while in average pooling, the mean value of the pool is calculated instead.

4. **Why do we Flatten Feature Maps?**

When a set of feature maps has been generated after passing the input through many consecutive convolutional layers, we need to flatten them into a single vector so that we can feed them into fully connected layers for classification. The reason why we need to flatten the feature maps is because densely connected layers cannot handle spatially arranged inputs like pixel intensities and colors. Therefore, we reshape the tensor of feature maps into a matrix, where each row represents a pixel location and each column represents the intensity or color value at that particular position.
