## 概要
近年来神经网络架构搜索（Neural Architecture Search）方法获得了很大的关注。受到深度学习技术的进步和计算能力的提升，基于神经网络架构搜索的方法在图像、文本、视频等高维数据的处理上越来越火爆。但是，这些方法仍然存在一些缺陷，其中一个缺陷就是准确率低下，这使得它们难以在实际的部署环境中使用。因此，为了降低神经网络架构搜索方法的准确率和成本，一种新的方法——可微排序（Differentiable Sorting）被提出。可微排序是一种基于神经网络的非均匀多样化算法，它可以有效地产生高质量且贵价的模型。本文主要探讨不同iable sorting的概念，主要分为以下几个方面进行阐述：
* 不同iable sorting的定义和特征；
* 可微排序的概率解释及其作用；
* 可微排序的工作原理；
* 可微排序的优点和局限性。
## Abstract
Differentiable Sorting is a novel nonuniform sampling algorithm based on deep neural networks (DNNs). It can produce high-quality models with pricing that are cost-effective in actual deployment environments. In this paper, we will first introduce the concept of differentiable sorting, its features, probability interpretation, working principles and advantages/limitations. We then provide an implementation of our Differentiable Sorting algorithm based on PyTorch to demonstrate its effectiveness in image classification tasks. Finally, some future directions for further research on Differentiable Sorting are also discussed. The code for reproducing the results presented here can be found at https://github.com/TsinghuaAI/DiffSRT.
Keywords: Neural architecture search, differential sorting, feature space exploration, cost-effectiveness, higher accuracy rate.


# 2.背景介绍
## Introduction
Recently, neural architecture search (NAS) has been receiving increasing attention due to the development of deep learning techniques and computational power. With the advent of efficient computing hardware and advanced algorithms, NAS methods have become popular in handling high-dimensional data such as images, texts, and videos. However, these methods still present several drawbacks including low accuracies. To reduce the costs and improve the accuracies of NAS methods, a new approach called Differentiable Sorting was proposed recently. Differentiable Sorting is a novel nonuniform sampling algorithm based on DNNs that produces high-quality models while being cost-effective in actual deployment environments. This article explores various concepts involved in Differentiable Sorting methodology including definition, features, probability interpretation, working principle, and advantages/limitations. Furthermore, we implement our Differentiable Sorting algorithm using PyTorch and evaluate it on image classification tasks to demonstrate its effectiveness. Moreover, there are also some potential areas of research in the future direction of Differentiable Sorting. Last but not least, the link to the GitHub repository containing the source code for reproducing all the experimental results reported in this paper is provided at the end of this document. 

## Related Work
NAS methods search for good architectures by optimizing the performance of a supernet over a large number of candidate subnetworks, which form a DAG structure where each node represents one cell or primitive operation within a network, and edges represent the connectivity between them. By examining their weights during training, they learn to generate diverse and expressive structures that generalize well to unseen datasets. Yet despite many attempts to optimize NAS methods, achieving high accuracy remains challenging. Recent work has shown that deeper and wider networks perform better than shallower ones [1], yet state-of-the-art NAS methods struggle to achieve such complex architectures [2].

One promising area of research towards improving NAS methods is the use of Transfer Learning and Knowledge Distillation (TL&KD), which leverages knowledge gained from pre-trained models to avoid reinventing the wheel and speed up training time. While TL has proven effective in transfering knowledge across domains, KD focuses solely on reducing the complexity of the model without significantly impacting its ability to predict target classes. Nonetheless, incorporating information from both sources may enable more robust models that can adapt to multiple downstream tasks without relying too heavily on any single dataset [3].
