        ## What is Seaborn?
        Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. The goal of this package is to make easy things easy and hard things possible.
       
        Seaborn was built with the philosophy that complex visualizations are better done with fewer lines of code. Its dataset-oriented API allows you to quickly generate complex plots many times faster than with Matplotlib alone. There is also a great deal of customizability in Seaborn, allowing you to adjust everything from the color palette to the individual elements of the plot.

        In summary, Seaborn makes creating high quality data visualizations easier and more accessible.

       ## Why should I use Seaborn?
       Using seaborn can help you create visually appealing and informative statistical graphics quickly and easily. Here are some reasons why you should consider using it:
       
       - Seaborn comes prepackaged with hundreds of datasets that can be used out-of-the-box for quick exploratory data analysis. You don't need to download or preprocess your own data beforehand.
       - Built-in themes and styles make the plots look modern and professional.
       - High-level functions like catplot() and jointplot() allow you to visualize large amounts of data with just one line of code.
       - Interactive plots let you zoom in on specific areas of the graph and hover over points to reveal additional information.
       - Seaborn integrates well with Pandas dataframes, making it simple to clean and transform your data into a format suitable for plotting.
       - Seaborn has a vibrant community that is constantly adding new features and functionality. New releases are announced frequently, so stay up-to-date with the latest additions.

       Overall, Seaborn offers an exceptional combination of ease-of-use, flexibility, and beautiful results when working with data. Let's get started! 

       # 2.Basic Concepts & Terminology

       ## Plot Types

       Seaborn supports several different types of plots such as scatterplots, histograms, kdeplots, and pairwise relationships. Each type of plot is typically associated with certain terminology and attributes. Let's explore these concepts briefly.

       ### Scatterplot

       A scatterplot (also called a scatterplot matrix) shows the relationship between two variables, where each point represents an observation. It helps to identify any linear relationships between the variables and can show clusters and outliers. Here's how you would create a basic scatterplot using Seaborn:
       
       ```python
       import seaborn as sns
       import pandas as pd
       
       iris = sns.load_dataset('iris')
       df = pd.DataFrame(iris['data'], columns=iris['feature_names'])
       sns.scatterplot(x='sepal length (cm)', y='petal width (cm)', hue='species', data=df);
       ```
       
       This creates a scatterplot of sepal length against petal width, colored by species, using the 'iris' dataset included in Seaborn. We specify the x-axis variable as `'sepal length (cm)'` and the y-axis variable as `'petal width (cm)'`, along with the `hue` attribute to group the data by species.

       
       Note that we didn't have to explicitly include the actual values of the variables in our dataframe. Instead, we passed the names of the columns to Seaborn and it automatically fetched those values from the dataset.

       ### Histograms

       A histogram is a graphical representation of data distribution that shows the frequency of occurrence of different values. They are useful for examining the shape of a distribution and identifying any unusual observations or patterns. Here's how you would create a basic histogram using Seaborn:

       ```python
       import numpy as np
       import seaborn as sns
       import pandas as pd
       
       mu, sigma = 0, 0.1
       s = np.random.normal(mu, sigma, 1000)
       hist_data = pd.Series(s)
       
       sns.distplot(hist_data, bins=30, kde=True,
                   color = 'darkblue',
                   hist_kws={'edgecolor':'black'},
                   kde_kws={'linewidth': 4});
       plt.xlabel('Value')
       plt.ylabel('Frequency');
       ```
       
       This generates a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.1, then passes it to Seaborn to generate a histogram. We set the number of bins to 30, turn on kernel density estimation (`kde`), change the colors of the bars and edges, and add labels to the axes.

       
       Note that since we generated the random data ourselves, we didn't pass it directly to Seaborn. Rather, we created a Pandas Series object containing the data and passed that instead.

       ### KDE Plots

       Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots are similar to histograms but represent the probability density function rather than frequencies. They are often preferred for representing distributions because they provide more accurate representations of the underlying data. Here's how you would create a KDE plot using Seaborn:

       ```python
       import numpy as np
       import seaborn as sns
       import pandas as pd
       
       x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
       y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
       
       df = pd.DataFrame({'x': x, 'y': y})
       
       sns.kdeplot(x="x", y="y", data=df);
       plt.xlabel('X')
       plt.ylabel('Y');
       ```
       
       This creates a DataFrame with x and y variables and passes it to Seaborn to create a KDE plot. Since there is no overlap between adjacent regions, we don't see much difference between them unless we zoom in closely.


       ### Pairwise Relationships

       Pairwise relationships are scatterplots showing all pairs of variables in a dataset. They are commonly used for exploring correlations and multicollinearity. Here's how you would create a pairwise relationships plot using Seaborn:

       ```python
       import seaborn as sns
       import pandas as pd
       
       tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")
       ax = sns.pairplot(tips, hue="sex");
       ```
       
       This uses the "tips" dataset provided by Seaborn and creates a pairwise relationships plot with sex separated by color. Note that the size of the markers indicates the magnitude of the correlation coefficient, which ranges from -1 (perfect inverse) to 1 (perfect positive).

       ## Introduction

       ### Dataset

       To illustrate the core algorithm, we will use a famous dataset of student performance in secondary education – EDUCATIONAL STUDENTS DATASET. It contains responses to questions regarding their level of knowledge about various topics including mathematics, reading comprehension, writing skills, social sciences, and science. Our goal is to analyze and extract insights from this dataset using visualizations.
