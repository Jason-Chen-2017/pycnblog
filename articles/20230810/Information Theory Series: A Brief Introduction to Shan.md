# 1.简介
         

        Information theory is a branch of mathematics concerned with the representation and transfer of information from one source to another through channels that are subject to errors. It has applications in various fields such as signal processing, communications engineering, computer science, economics, biology, medicine, finance, and many others. In this article we will discuss about two fundamental concepts of entropy, namely, surprise and mutual information, which are closely related to each other but have different meanings depending on context. We also briefly explain some key algorithms for calculating shannon's entropy and provide concrete examples of how they work using Python programming language. Finally, we conclude by discussing the limitations of these approaches and some future directions for research. 
        
        
        # 2. Basic Concepts and Terminologies
        
        Before diving into the details, let us first understand some basic ideas behind entropy. Entropy is an intrinsic measure of disorder or randomness in a system. The term "disorder" here refers to any kind of irregularity or noise present in the system, including stochastic events like coin flips and phenomena like thermal fluctuations in a microprocessor. The goal of entropy is to quantify this uncertainty so that it can be used effectively in information-theoretic tasks such as communication coding, error detection, data compression, and modeling of systems with random dynamics. 
        
        To measure entropy, we use mathematical functions called entropies. There are several types of entropies - discrete, continuous, and multidimensional. Let's take a closer look at each type separately. 
        
        ## Discrete Entropy (Shannon's)
        
        For a discrete probability distribution $p_i$ over a finite set $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N$, where $N$ is the number of possible outcomes, the discrete entropy H(X) is defined as follows:
        $$H(X) = -\sum_{i=1}^Np_ilog_2(p_i).$$ 
        This formula shows that lower entropy corresponds to more ordered distributions and higher entropy corresponds to more chaotic or random distributions. Specifically, when all the probabilities sum up to 1, the maximum entropy attained is log$_2N$. Therefore, if we want to minimize the entropy of our data while ensuring good quality of the distribution, we need to choose a uniform distribution over all possibilities. On the other hand, when the probabilities do not add up to 1, there will be some missing probabilities and thus leading to lower entropy values. This can happen especially in case of rare events or when we have limited resources available. 
        
        Note that Shannon introduced the concept of discrete entropy and the corresponding function called entropy after his friend and colleague <NAME>. His equation was later popularized under the names of Kullback–Leibler divergence and relative entropy. 
        
        ## Continuous Entropy
        
        For a continuous probability density function $f(x)$ over a domain $[a,b]$, the continuous entropy H(X) is given by:
        $$H(X)=-\int_{a}^{b}f(x)log_2(f(x))dx.$$ 
        Here, the integral represents the average amount of information needed to encode the random variable X across all possible inputs within the range [a,b]. Lower entropy corresponds to less complex functions and higher entropy corresponds to more complex ones. Again, increasing entropy means reducing the complexity of the function and vice versa. In general, we expect high entropy in smooth functions (such as Gaussians), low entropy in piecewise constant functions (such as step functions), and intermediate entropy between these extremes in continuous variables. However, since we cannot actually sample from non-stationary processes directly, we cannot compute their entropy exactly. Instead, we need to approximate them numerically using Monte Carlo methods or numerical integration techniques.  
        
        ## Multidimensional Entropy
        
        If X is a vector of independent random variables, i.e., X = (X1,...,Xn), then the joint entropy H(X) can be calculated using the definition:
        $$H(X)=-\sum_{i=1}^Nh(Xi).$$ 
        Here h(Xi) is the entropy of individual variable Xi, computed using either discrete or continuous entropy calculations depending on whether Xi is discrete or continuous respectively. Multiplying the entropies of all dimensions together gives the total entropy. As before, lower entropy corresponds to more uniform distributions and higher entropy corresponds to more mixed distributions. Similar observations hold even when considering higher dimensional spaces.  
        
        # 3. Core Algorithms and Examples
        
        Now, let's talk about core algorithms for computing entropy and some practical examples. These include:
        1. Shannon's Entropy Algorithm
        2. Kullback–Leibler Divergence
        3. Mutual Information
         
        
        ## Shannon's Entropy Algorithm
        
        The classic algorithm for computing entropy of discrete data is known as Shannon's algorithm. It works as follows:
         1. Compute the frequency of occurrence of each symbol $c$ in the input data sequence $x$.
         2. Normalize the frequencies by dividing them by the total number of symbols in the data sequence.
         3. Calculate the entropy as negative sum of the product of normalized frequency and the base-2 logarithm of the normalized frequency.
         
        Mathematically, the algorithm can be written as:
        $$\boxed{H(x)=-\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \left(\frac{f_n}{\sum_{n'=1}^Nf_{n'}}\right)\cdot\log_2\left(\frac{f_n}{\sum_{n'=1}^Nf_{n'}}\right)}.$$ 
        Here, $f_n$ denotes the frequency of occurrence of symbol n, N is the total number of symbols in the sequence, and $\log_2$ denotes the natural logarithm to the base 2. 
        
        ## Example 1: Computing the Entropy of a Coin Fair
        
        Consider the following experiment: You flip a fair coin repeatedly until you get three heads in a row. After every trial, write down the result (heads or tails) on a piece of paper. What is the most probable outcome of the coin? How certain are we of knowing the correct answer based on the results obtained? Can we estimate the entropy of the process based on the observed outcomes?
        
        One approach to solve this problem would be to count the frequency of each outcome ("heads", "tails") and normalize them by dividing them by the total number of trials. We could then calculate the entropy of the coin as follows:
        $$H(x)=\begin{cases}-\frac{1}{3}\log_2\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) & x="HTT"\\-\frac{2}{3}\log_2\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) & x=\{HTH, HTT, TTH\}\\0 & otherwise.\end{cases}$$ 
        Based on the probabilities shown above, the expected value of the coin should be around 75% heads and 25% tails. Thus, assuming a fair coin, the entropy of observing the outcomes of three consecutive flips should be close to zero. We cannot estimate the entropy precisely because we don't know what the underlying probability distribution of the coin looks like. Nevertheless, we can see that the entropy is much smaller than zero indicating that we have successfully reduced the uncertainty of the process.
        
        
        ## Example 2: Calculating Mutual Information Between Two Random Variables
        
        Suppose we have two random variables X and Y, both having a joint probability distribution P(X,Y). We can define the mutual information I(X;Y) as the difference between the entropy of X and the conditional entropy of X given Y, denoted as H(X)-H(X|Y):
        $$I(X;Y)=H(X)-H(X|Y)$$ 
        Where H(X) is the entropy of X and H(X|Y) is the conditional entropy of X given Y, calculated as follows:
        $$H(X|Y)=-\sum_{y}\sum_{x\in X}(P(x,y)\cdot\log_2P(x,y)),$$ 
        and the joint entropy of X and Y can be calculated similarly using H(X) and H(Y).
        
        Assuming that X and Y are binary variables, we can derive closed form expressions for I(X;Y) and H(X|Y). For example, suppose X is the temperature in Celsius and Y is the wind speed in miles per hour. We can assume that the joint probability distribution of X and Y can be modeled using a bivariate normal distribution with correlation coefficient $\rho$:
        $$P(x,y)=\frac{1}{Z}\exp\left(-\frac{(x-\mu_x)^2}{2\sigma^2_x}-\frac{(y-\mu_y)^2}{2\sigma^2_y}-\frac{\rho(x-\mu_x)(y-\mu_y)}{2\sigma^2_{xy}}\right)$$ 
        Here, $\mu_x,\mu_y$ are the means of the two variables, $\sigma^2_x,\sigma^2_y$ are the variances of the two variables, and $\sigma^2_{xy}$ is the covariance matrix, given by $\sigma^2_{xy}=cov(x,y)=\rho\sqrt{\sigma^2_x\sigma^2_y}$. Substituting the parameters, we obtain:
        $$I(X;Y)=H(X)+H(Y)-2H(X,Y)$$ 
        Using the fact that $H(XY)=H(X)+H(Y)$ and applying Bayes' rule to swap X and Y, we obtain:
        $$I(X;Y)=H(X)+H(Y)-2H(Y,X)$$ 
        We can further simplify this expression using the definitions of entropy and conditional entropy:
        $$I(X;Y)=\frac{1}{Z_X}H(X)-\frac{1}{Z_Y}H(Y)-\frac{1}{Z_{XY}}H(X,Y)$$ 
        where Z_X, Z_Y, and Z_{XY} are normalization factors for X, Y, and X and Y combined respectively. The third term appears only when X and Y are dependent. 
        
        Based on the assumptions made and the properties of the Gaussian distribution, we can show that the value of the third term vanishes as $\rho$ goes to infinity. This suggests that the mutual information between X and Y becomes very large when $\rho$ goes to positive or negative infinity. When $\rho$ is small enough, the mutual information is estimated using samples drawn from the joint distribution.
