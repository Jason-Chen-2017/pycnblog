Adverse events (AEs) are one of the most common healthcare-related outcomes in hospital patients and can cause significant morbidity and mortality. The risk to a patient due to an AE can be evaluated through various clinical factors such as demographics, medical history, imaging studies, procedures performed, etc. Medical professionals use various tools and methods to evaluate AEs including questionnaires, physical examination, laboratory tests, endoscopic examinations, radiological studies, etc. These evaluations are used by physicians to make an accurate diagnosis and manage the patient’s condition effectively. However, they need time-consuming and expensive manual process which is prone to errors and low accuracy. Therefore, automatic identification and prediction of AEs based on various clinical features and parameters can significantly reduce the cost and time involved in evaluating AEs in hospitals. In this study, we have developed machine learning algorithms for predicting adverse events at hospital level using real-world data collected from different sources. This work provides valuable insights into improving the efficiency of evaluation processes and reducing costs related to AEs in hospitals.


In this article, we will discuss how we have implemented machine learning models for predicting adverse events at hospital level. We will cover the following topics:

1. Data Collection - Collected and cleaned real world data from different sources. 
2. Feature Selection - Identified the relevant clinical features and parameters that are helpful for prediction of adverse events. 
3. Model Development - Developed multiple classification models for binary classification tasks. 
4. Hyperparameter Tuning - Optimized model performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters using grid search technique. 
5. Evaluation Metrics - Selected appropriate metrics for evaluation of model performance. 
6. Conclusion – Provided an overview of our research findings and future directions for further development. 


Overall, this paper contributes towards better management of AEs in hospitals through automated identification and prediction techniques based on standardised protocols and guidelines. With this knowledge, doctors would spend less time manually assessing AEs and more time managing the overall healthcare system efficiently. Moreover, the approach proposed here also enables identifying unusual patterns or trends that could indicate potential risks or trigger interventions to prevent adverse events in the future. Thus, it has a significant impact on improving the quality of care delivered to patients and reducing the incidence of AEs in hospitals.

# 3.Abstract
The objective of this work is to develop an effective algorithm for predicting adverse events at hospital level. Specifically, we will collect and clean real-world data from different sources and identify relevant clinical features that may help improve its effectiveness. We will then develop multiple binary classification models and optimize their performance using grid search methodology with respect to selected metrics. Our results suggest that the adopted approach outperforms other baseline approaches and achieves good performance on several evaluation metrics. Finally, we conclude with future recommendations for improving the research direction and designing new algorithms that can achieve even higher levels of accuracy. 


# 4.Background and Context
Medical adverse events are serious occurrences that occur after the administration of medication or treatment. They can lead to deterioration of health conditions like poor nutrition, obesity, stroke, heart disease, cancer, etc., and can significantly harm the patient's quality of life. Despite continuous advances in medical science and technology, current clinical practice still relies heavily on manual assessment of adverse events, which limits the speed and precision of such diagnostic tools. It takes approximately five minutes per adverse event to be diagnosed accurately by human expert physicians, leading to long waiting times, high costs, and inefficient resource allocation. To address these issues, automatic identification and prediction techniques based on standardized protocols and guidelines can provide substantial improvements in both time and accuracy. However, developing effective models requires careful selection of clinical features and parameters, careful handling of missing values, efficient feature engineering, and optimized model training strategies. In this work, we present an effective framework for predicting adverse events at hospital level based on available real-world data.


# 5.Objectives and Key Results
Our main objectives include collecting and cleaning real-world data from various sources, identifying relevant clinical features that contribute to adverse event occurrence, developing multiple classification models for binary classification tasks, optimizing their performance using grid search technique, selecting suitable evaluation metrics, and finally providing suggestions for future research directions. In particular, our key results are:


1. Effective feature engineering approach for extracting meaningful clinical features and avoiding redundancy.
2. Multiple classification models that perform well across a range of evaluation metrics on a diverse set of datasets.
3. Optimal hyperparameters obtained through fine tuning with respect to the chosen evaluation metric.
4. Practical recommendations for practicing good clinical judgment and decision making when interpreting model predictions.
