## 2.Background Introduction

The purpose of natural lighting is to provide daylight for humans and other living organisms while minimizing any environmental impacts such as heat and noise. 

For example, most modern buildings have either natural floors or ceiling tiles that reflect the sunlight directly into them without any filter or structure attached. These glass structures produce warm, bright light throughout the entire building, providing comfort and shelter to all occupants inside. 

However, there are still certain factors that contribute to unnatural feelings of brightness and coolness caused by artificial lighting devices installed in our homes. Some of these include excessive power consumption from LED lamps, interference from overhead lights, and open flame height due to incorrect placement of the light source. Moreover, even though many people claim that greenhouse gases release harmful radiation, this does not mean that human activities must necessarily rely solely on natural light sources. According to World Health Organization (WHO), some air pollution levels may result from improper disposal of natural gas-based heating equipment. Therefore, making effective use of natural light is crucial in achieving a healthier home environment.

To achieve better lighting conditions in your home, here are some tips:

1. Choose sunny hours when possible: During the daytime, we receive almost two thirds of our sun’s energy, so taking advantage of this resource makes things much easier. Be sure to adjust your schedule accordingly if possible.

2. Consider installing only one or two types of natural lighting fixtures: We typically see far more natural light than artificial ones in our households. Instead of installing multiple different kinds of fixtures, consider installing just enough lighting to cover the whole space. This way, you can minimize maintenance costs and ensure that your home stays relatively cooler overall.

3. Check out nearby sources of natural lighting: It doesn’t always need to be downhill or near a body of water to enjoy beautiful natural light. Look around your area and identify any plants, trees, and bushes which offer shade. Placing these beneath your windows can create some nice natural ambiance for you and others outside. Just make sure to replace these shaded areas regularly to preserve the natural beauty they provide.

4. Ensure your roof has clearance underneath: Natural light lets in a lot of direct solar radiation, especially from the sky. Keeping your roof away from the direct sunlight keeps the amount of free-floating air higher and reduces the risk of heat illusion. Also, being able to see both sides of your window can help prevent blindspots caused by overcast skies.

5. Utilize dimmer switch controls: The amount of natural light entering your home varies depending on several factors, including the angle between the sun and your location. Using dimmer switches can help you easily adjust the level of lighting based on the ambient temperature and cloud cover.

6. Reduce motion in your home: Motion blinds can cause damage to your natural lighting system. Try moving slowly and staying stationary whenever possible.
