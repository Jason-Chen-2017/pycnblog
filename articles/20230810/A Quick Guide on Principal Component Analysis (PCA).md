Principal component analysis (PCA), also known as statistical factor analysis or Karhunen-Loeve transform is a popular technique used for dimensionality reduction in data analysis and machine learning applications. PCA transforms the high-dimensional dataset into a set of new uncorrelated variables that represent most of the variance in the original dataset. The resulting principal components are linear combinations of the original variables with high variances along each direction. They can be interpreted as directions in the feature space that capture most of the information about the original features. Therefore, by selecting the right subset of principal components, we can capture important patterns and relationships between the variables while discarding noise and redundancy. In this article, we will go through the basic concepts behind PCA, illustrate how it works using Python code examples, explain its mathematical formulations, and conclude with future research directions.
This article assumes readers have a basic understanding of multivariate statistics, linear algebra, and python programming language.

## Data representation
In order to perform PCA, we need to first understand the underlying data representation. Let's consider two variables X and Y from a multidimensional dataset $\{X_i,Y_i\}_{i=1}^n$. Each variable has n observations, which makes up an n-dimensional observation vector $[X_i,Y_i]$. We assume that there exists some unknown function $f(x)$ that maps every n-dimensional observation vector [X_i,Y_i] onto a single scalar value $z_i$ for i = 1,...,n. This mapping represents the true relationship between X and Y. For example, if f(x) is a straight line passing through the origin, then all points x whose projections onto the line satisfy $(f(x)-f([0,0]))^2+|x-\left[\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{n}{x_j}}{n},\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{n}{y_j}}{n}\right]|^2<\epsilon$, where \epsilon is a small tolerance parameter, would be considered close enough to the line for us to ignore any remaining irrelevant dimensions. 

Let's call these mappings functions of type $h:R^n\rightarrow R$. If we want to recover the intrinsic structure of our data, without any prior knowledge of what the true functions might look like, we must find a way to convert each point $[X_i,Y_i]$ back into a more informative representation that captures its geometry better than its raw counterpart. One approach is to use linear transformations such that $z_i=\phi(X_i,Y_i)^T\cdot W$ for some matrix W. Here, $\phi:[0,1]\times\{0,1\}^\infty\rightarrow R^m$ is a map that maps pairs of continuous random variables (X,Y) to m-dimensional vectors. Since $\phi$ satisfies certain properties, we know that the resulting transformation preserves distances and angles between points, but may not preserve their absolute values.

However, since $Z=[z_1,\ldots,z_n]^T$ only contains information about relative scales between different coordinates, we cannot fully interpret it directly. Instead, we can construct new basis vectors to describe the same information as follows: define $W$ to be the eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix $\Sigma$ corresponding to the largest eigenvalues (which correspond to the dimensions with highest variance). These eigenvectors are the principal components of our data, and they encode the maximum amount of variation along each direction. By projecting our data onto these new axes, we can obtain new representations that contain more useful information about the data.

We now have a clear idea about the role of the various types of variables in representing high-dimensional datasets. Moreover, we have learned that principal component analysis provides a means of finding low-dimensional representations of our data that are maximally informative while minimizing noise and interference from other sources of variance.

## Optimization problem
The main goal of PCA is to reduce the dimensionality of the data by identifying the principal components that maximize the amount of variance explained by them. Formally, given a data set $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n\in\mathbb{R}^d$ consisting of d variables, we wish to identify a set of new uncorrelated variables $\{z_i\}_{i=1}^k\in\mathbb{R}^k$ that best capture the variations in the original data. We call the set of k new variables "principal components", since they capture the primary directions of greatest variance among the original variables. To achieve this, we optimize a cost function that measures the distance between the original data and its projected version onto the chosen principal components. Specifically, we minimize the squared error:
$$\min_{W\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times k},b\in\mathbb{R}^k}\sum_{i=1}^n(\Phi(x_i)-b-Wx_i)^T\hat{\Lambda}(W)(\Phi(x_i)-b-Wx_i)$$ 
where $\hat{\Lambda}(W)=\text{diag}(w_1^Tw_1,\ldots,w_d^Tw_d)$ is the diagonal matrix of square root of eigenvalues of $WW^T$. Intuitively, we want to choose the components so that the differences between the original data and their projections onto the chosen components are as small as possible, while at the same time preserving their correlation structure. The optimal choice of b and W depends on the values of the original variables x, and thus requires optimization over both model parameters and input data. However, in practice, we can often approximate the solution iteratively by choosing initial values for W and running multiple iterations of gradient descent updates until convergence.

Therefore, the key steps in performing PCA include:
1. Compute the empirical mean of the data set to center it around zero. 
2. Compute the sample covariance matrix Sigma = (1/n) * X*X', where X is the centered data set.
3. Find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of Sigma using standard techniques such as QR decomposition or SVD. The eigenvectors are the principal components, ordered by decreasing variance. 
4. Project the data onto the top k principal components obtained from step 3, obtaining z = W^Tx + b.
