|<NAME>      | OR      | Operations Research | Introduction to Intelligent Logistics Operations Management Techniques | https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/introduction-intelligent-logistic-operations-management-techniques-hamid-nouribechi | Operational intelligence (OI) refers to the ability of organizations to perform efficient, effective, and profitable operations. OI enables organizations to adapt their strategies, policies, procedures, and technology in response to changes in market conditions, customer needs, competitive pressures, regulatory constraints, and changing business priorities. To implement OI effectively, organizations need to adopt integrated approaches and use advanced technologies. Intelligent logistics is one of the fastest growing markets in the last decade and has significant impact on all facets of society. Thus, understanding and utilizing intelligent logistics operation management techniques is critical for any organization looking to optimize operations, improve efficiencies, enhance outcomes, reduce costs, and maximize value creation. Therefore, this article aims at providing a brief introduction to several intelligent logistics operations management techniques, ranging from supply chain analytics and optimization to quality control and risk management. | Hamid Nouribechi                                    | July 17, 2019          | July 17, 2019          | September 12, 2021     |
|<NAME>    | DL      | Deep Learning  | Driving Intelligent Logistics Decision-Making With Deep Learning | https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/driving-intelligent-logistics-decision-making-deep-learning-matt-duckworth    | As the size of the global supply chains continues to grow exponentially, so does the complexity of managing logistics. To meet this challenge, intelligent logistics can exploit human intelligence, autonomy, and automation to coordinate distributed robots, sensors, and machines to deliver goods safely, efficiently, and cost-effectively. One way to achieve this goal is to integrate modern machine learning techniques alongside human decision-making and optimization capabilities. However, building such a framework requires careful consideration of the ethical implications of deploying machine learning algorithms, evaluating their effectiveness, and maintaining responsible stakeholders' trust. In this blog post, I discuss three core principles of driving intelligent logistics decision-making with deep learning, namely transparency, fairness, and bias awareness. These principles ensure that stakeholders understand how the decisions made by intelligent logistics algorithms affect societal outcomes and avoid unintended negative consequences. Additionally, I propose a step-by-step guideline for integrating neural networks and decision-making into intelligent logistics workflows and platforms to increase overall efficacy and flexibility in logistics decision-making. | Matthew Duckworth                                   | September 21, 2019     | September 21, 2019     | December 12, 2021       |
