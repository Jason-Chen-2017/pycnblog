Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites and saving it in a structured format for further use or analysis. It involves writing code that interacts with web pages to extract information such as text, images, videos etc., which can then be saved into a database or used for other purposes. This article will walk you through building your first simple web crawler using Python programming language. We will also learn how to write efficient and scalable scraper software by avoiding common pitfalls and dealing with challenges like dynamic content loading, error handling and security issues. 

In this part we will cover basic concepts, terms and technologies involved in web scraping along with installing required libraries and tools. We will build our own web crawling application step-by-step starting with downloading and parsing HTML page contents, implementing pagination logic to handle long web pages, understanding how to make requests to URLs, filtering out unwanted data and storing results in a CSV file. Finally, we will talk about some advanced techniques like asynchronous processing, caching, and load balancing to improve performance while minimizing risks associated with website downtime.


By the end of this tutorial, you should have built an effective and robust web crawler that can efficiently mine data from various sources on the internet and save them in a structured format suitable for further analysis or usage. You would also gain insights into optimizing and scaling up web scrapers for large scale projects that require high volume, low latency, and reliable performance. I hope you enjoy reading! Let's get started. 


# 2.背景介绍
Web scraping is one of the most popular ways to gather data from the internet, especially when it comes to big datasets. The internet contains a lot of valuable resources available online, but there are many restrictions imposed by websites. Most importantly, they often restrict access to their resources to prevent overloading their servers and causing slowdowns and problems for users. In order to circumvent these restrictions, web developers and researchers have developed several techniques called "scrapers" that leverage the power of machine learning algorithms to extract useful information from websites automatically without human intervention. One way to automate web scraping is to create automated scripts that retrieve data from websites based on predefined criteria or patterns. These scripts can periodically crawl websites and download data as soon as new updates are made to those sites. 

This technique has been widely adopted due to its efficiency and effectiveness. However, it requires knowledge of computer programming languages, libraries, and web technologies such as HTTP protocols, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, JSON, XPath, and regular expressions. Additionally, it takes time to develop and maintain such complex systems, making it essential to choose carefully the approach taken to minimize risk, cost, and effort spent on developing and maintaining such applications. To summarize, web scraping involves automating processes to collect data from various sources on the internet and store them in a structured format suitable for later analysis or usage. As a result, it helps to generate new insights into business operations, scientific research, and social sciences, particularly in areas where traditional databases are not well suited. Therefore, becoming familiar with fundamental principles of web scraping and its technical details is crucial if you want to fully realize its potential benefits. 

In this series of articles, we will learn how to design and implement a simple yet powerful web crawler using Python programming language. By the end of this course, you will understand the basics of web scraping, learn how to identify and fix common pitfalls, and appreciate the importance of following best practices to ensure successful web scraping activities. Along the way, you will learn how to optimize and scale up your scraper system for large-scale projects that require high volumes, low latencies, and reliable performance. Moreover, you will gain experience in working with APIs and web services, analyzing web traffic statistics, and dealing with issues related to dynamically loaded content and security vulnerabilities. At the same time, you will acquire practical skills and knowledge that will help you grow as a developer and take advantage of the latest advancements in technology.
