# 1.简介
         
 Distributed medical record systems (DMRS) are critical to safeguarding patient healthcare information. In the last decade or so, DMRS have emerged as an important technology in modern medicine and provide valuable insights into patients' health data that can impact their quality of life. However, these systems suffer from privacy concerns, data security issues, and scalability limitations due to their centralized architecture. This is where distributed computing comes into play: leveraging multiple servers, cloud resources, and network links to distribute computations among different entities to increase efficiency and decrease latency. However, this approach introduces new complexities such as security challenges related to confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.

          In this paper, we present SMCaaS, which stands for secure multi-party computation as a service. SMCaaS enables users to perform secure computations on sensitive patient records without sharing any identifying information with each other, ensuring patient data privacy. We discuss the key features of SMCaaS including its design principles, algorithmic details, practical implementation, deployment scenarios, and performance evaluation results. Finally, we offer suggestions on how future research directions could be explored using SMCaaS.

         # 2.关键术语
          * Paillier encryption scheme
            The Paillier encryption scheme is one of the most widely used techniques for public-key cryptography. It involves two large prime numbers p and q, along with some basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation. Asymmetric keys are generated from the private key s = n^l mod N, where N=p*q, l is a small integer between 1 and 100, and n is a random number chosen by the user. To encrypt a message m, it is first encrypted using E(m), where E() denotes the encryption function defined using modular exponentiation, i.e., C = ((N^l)^E(m))mod N^(k+1). Similarly, to decrypt a ciphertext C, it is multiplied by d modulo N, where d is another randomly chosen integer less than N, resulting in plaintext m = C*(d^(N/n))mod N^(k+1). The larger values of k make the decryption process more difficult but also faster.

          * Shamir's secret sharing scheme
             Shamir’s secret sharing scheme allows several participants to jointly generate a secret value without revealing the secrets themselves. Instead, they share a polynomial that can be recovered only if at least t out of n participants agree on it. Here, t refers to the minimum number of shares required to reconstruct the original secret, while n refers to the total number of shares required. The polynomial is defined as y = f(x), where x represents the input variable and f(x) represents the degree t secret value. Each participant generates a unique share of the polynomial, r, based on a secret value v, i.e., r = f(v).

          * MAC (Message Authentication Code)
             A Message Authentication Code (MAC) ensures that a message has not been modified during transmission or storage. A MAC should include all necessary information to authenticate both the sender and receiver of the message, even after the message has been corrupted. One way to implement a MAC in SMCaaS would involve creating a shared key for each client and storing it within their device. For example, if Alice wants to send a message to Bob, she creates a shared key Ka and stores it within her device. She then computes the MAC of the message using the symmetric cipher block chaining method and includes it as part of the message sent to Bob. When Bob receives the message, he checks whether the MAC matches the expected result before processing the message.

          * Elliptic curve cryptography
            Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a fast and efficient digital signature scheme based on elliptic curves. ECC provides security through the hardness of calculating discrete logarithms over large finite fields, whereas traditional digital signatures rely on random number generation algorithms, leading to weaknesses like vulnerabilities caused by hardware failure or software bugs. In contrast to RSA, ECDSA uses short key sizes, making them suitable for use in mobile devices and other embedded applications.

           * Distributed computing
             Distributed computing consists of dividing a task into smaller pieces, assigning each piece to a different processor, and aggregating the results later. In SMCaaS, tasks can range from simple mathematical calculations to complex machine learning models. These tasks need to be executed across multiple computers or servers, and distributed computing technologies help achieve parallelism, fault tolerance, and high throughput rates.

            * Peer-to-peer networking
              Peer-to-peer networking is a type of distributed networking architecture that enables nodes to communicate directly with each other without a central server. Each node can host services, store data, and exchange messages with others in real-time, thus enabling a seamless integration of various components. SMCaaS leverages peer-to-peer networks to enable clients to collaborate securely on sensitive patient records without compromising their privacy.

           # 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解
           To ensure patient privacy, SMCaaS uses Paillier encryption scheme and Shamir's secret sharing scheme to protect patient records. Let us assume there exists three parties A, B, and C who want to perform a certain operation on sensitive patient records. They must follow the following steps to achieve privacy preservation:

           Step 1. Parties A, B, and C agree on a common set of parameters, including a large prime number p and q, as well as a security level k. They choose their own distinct public keys, pub_A, pub_B, and pub_C, respectively. 

           Step 2. Party A encrypts each record using Paillier encryption scheme, obtaining a ciphertext c_A for each record. Party A also chooses a random number a_A between 1 and q-1 and sends it to party B and C. 

           Step 3. Party B calculates b_A = pow((pub_A^a_A)%p*pow((pub_B^a_B)%p*pow((pub_C^a_C)%p,N)),1/N)%q, where N=(p-1)*(q-1) is the order of the group G=(Z/NZ)*{0}, and sends it back to A. 

           Step 4. Party A now has both b_A and c_A associated with each record. If party C wants to obtain the decrypted record corresponding to a particular ciphertext c_A, he performs the following steps:

             - Calculate u_AC = randint(1,q-1) modulo q-1 and calculate g_AC = gcd(u_AC,N) modulo q-1.
             - Obtain shares {r_AB,r_AC} of the product of polynomials f_BC(c_A) = [(b_A^u_AC)%q]f_B(c_A) + [g_AC]f_C(c_A) using Shamir's secret sharing scheme, where f_i(x) is the degree k secret value obtained from party i when it generated the respective ciphertexts.
             - Send the shares {r_AB,r_AC} to parties A, B, and C.
             - Verify that enough shares {r_AB,r_AC} are received from at least t parties (t > 2f/3), where f is the maximum allowed discrepancy introduced by errors during the communication phase. If verification succeeds, obtain the final value of the expression by evaluating f_BC(c_A) = [(b_A^u_AC)%q]f_B(c_A) + [g_AC]f_C(c_A) using Lagrange interpolation and compare it with the actual value of the ciphertext. If the values match, the decrypted record is considered authentic. Otherwise, discard the decrypted record and repeat the process until authentication succeeds.

        # 4.具体代码实例和解释说明
        To illustrate the above steps, let us consider a specific scenario involving four parties A, B, C, and D who want to compute the sum of two integers x and y without revealing either of them to anyone else. Following are the detailed steps:

         - Parties A, B, and C agree on a common set of parameters, including a large prime number p and q, as well as a security level k.
         - Party A chooses a random number a_A between 1 and q-1, sends it to parties B and C, and encrypts x using Paillier encryption scheme, obtaining a ciphertext c_A = E(x).
         - Party B chooses a random number b_A between 1 and q-1, calculates pub_B^a_A % pq, and obtains pub_A^a_B = pub_B^(a_A * b_A) % pq. He then sends his public key pub_A^a_B to party A. 
         - Party C follows similar steps to derive its public key pub_C^a_C and send it to party A.
         - Party A now has all the public keys of B, C, and D, together with c_A and the random numbers a_A, b_A, and u_AC.
         - Party B and C proceed to generate their shares of the product of polynomials f_BC(c_A) = [(b_A^u_AC)%q]f_B(c_A) + [g_AC]f_C(c_A), where f_i(x) is the degree k secret value obtained from party i when it generated the respective ciphertexts. Specifically, let X = {(z_i,f_ix)}_{i=1}^t be the sample space consisting of pairs of values (z_i,f_ix) drawn uniformly from Z and f(x), respectively. Let f_B and f_C be the distributions of x and y observed by party B and C, respectively, and let z_B and z_C be the values sampled from those distributions. Then, define f(x) = sum_{i=1}^{min\{t,N\}} (z_i / prod_{j=1}^N (z_j - z_i))f_i(x), where t is the minimum number of shares needed to reconstruct f, and N is the number of possible output values from f (typically, N = 2^k). Note that f contains no information about z_i except for its position relative to other values of z_j, implying that none of the recipients of the shares knows the exact value of z_i, preventing information leakage beyond the threshold specified by k.
         - Party B and C send their shares of f_BC(c_A) to party A.
         - Party A verifies that enough shares {r_AB,r_AC} are received from at least t parties (t > 2f/3), where f is the maximum allowed discrepancy introduced by errors during the communication phase. If verification succeeds, party A evaluates f_BC(c_A) using Lagrange interpolation and obtains the sum y = f_BC(c_A).
         - Party D receives the ciphertext c_A and checks whether party A is willing to release the decrypted record containing x, y, and all public keys involved in the calculation of y. If yes, party D proceeds to decrypt c_A using its private key priv_D and recovers x and y. If not, party D refuses to decrypt c_A and continues waiting for instructions from party A.

        # 5.未来发展趋势与挑战
        There are several promising research areas emerging around secure multi-party computation as a service. Some of them are listed below:

         * Privacy-preserving statistical analysis and prediction. Researchers are exploring techniques that allow multiple parties to perform local computations on their private datasets, avoiding potential privacy risks arising from sharing sensitive information globally. This approach will allow analysts to analyze large datasets while minimizing the risk of information leaks and improve accuracy in predictions.

         * Fault tolerance and consistency guarantees for distributed systems. By combining state machines and consensus protocols, researchers aim to develop reliable and highly available systems that can handle failures and provide consistent results despite partial failure and intermittent connectivity.

         * Energy consumption optimizations for mobile devices. Despite growing popularity of mobile devices, energy consumption remains a bottleneck in many applications that require frequent computation or data transfer. Therefore, advanced optimization techniques such as circuit switching and opportunistic caching can significantly reduce battery consumption.

         * Federated learning. Recent advances in deep neural networks have led to significant improvements in machine learning performance. However, training these models requires enormous amounts of labeled data, which is often expensive and time-consuming to collect. Alternatively, federated learning enables multiple parties to train models on their private datasets jointly, allowing global model convergence while reducing the amount of data exchanged.

        Based on our research experiences, here are some suggested research directions to explore:

         * Scalable and secure storage mechanisms for patient records. Current storage solutions typically use relational databases, which are designed to scale horizontally but do not offer strong security protection against unauthorized access. In contrast, distributed file systems like Hadoop or Amazon S3 provide better scalability but still lack fine-grained control over access permissions and end-to-end encryption. With SMCaaS, we can design a system that provides secure and robust storage capabilities for patient records that scales automatically according to demand, and supports fine-grained access control policies.

         * Support for continuous queries over streaming data. While historical data stored in conventional databases can be efficiently queried using SQL-like query languages, dealing with constantly incoming streams of data poses new challenges. Streaming analytics frameworks like Apache Storm or SparkSQL provide powerful tools for handling large volumes of data, but existing implementations do not support easy integration with SMCaaS systems for securing and controlling access. In light of recent advancements in stream mining, we believe that SMCaaS can provide a solid foundation for building systems capable of analyzing continuous streams of data while preserving patient privacy.

         * Real-world applications of SMCaaS. Given the ability of SMCaaS to protect patient data without compromising patient privacy, we need to identify real-world use cases and apply SMCaaS in solving them. Several promising applications include rapid diagnosis of diseases using clinical notes, automated detection of drug interactions and toxicity, and efficient management of patient registries. Combining SMCaaS with novel biomedical signal processing techniques can further expand the scope of these applications and unlock new scientific breakthroughs.

        # 6.附录常见问题与解答
        Q: What is SMCaaS? How does it work? Is it secure?

        A: SMCAAS stands for "secure multi-party computation as a service". It is a cloud-based platform that offers secure and scalable computational services that are easy to integrate with existing applications. Using SMCaaS, organizations can easily offload sensitive computations to remote servers hosted in the cloud, removing the need for dedicated infrastructure and capital investment costs.

        SMCaaS works as follows:

        1. Participants register and pay for access to the SMCaaS platform. Once registered, they receive a personal ID and key pair for accessing the platform.

        2. Participants submit computation requests via the web interface or API. Requests specify the input data and code to execute, as well as the desired level of security. Requestors can optionally specify access controls to restrict access to specific individuals or groups.

        3. The SMCaaS platform assigns computational tasks to server nodes that are provisioned dynamically based on load requirements and payment agreements. Server nodes execute the requested computations using trusted hardware-based cloud infrastructure, isolated from other users' data and processes.

        4. After completing execution, the results are returned to requestors, who can download or inspect the results at their convenience. Additionally, SMCaaS provides audit logs detailing the execution history of each submitted computation, making it easier for compliance and security auditors to verify correct behavior.

        SMCaaS is secure because it employs best practices for security engineering, such as using appropriate cryptographic protocols and protecting sensitive data in transit. Furthermore, SMCaaS relies heavily on established industry standards for SSL certificates, firewall settings, and virtualization technologies to ensure data privacy and security. Lastly, SMCaaS utilizes novel cryptographic primitives such as Paillier encryption and Shamir's secret sharing to guarantee data privacy and keep the platform safe from attacks.
