# 1.简介
         

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are one of the most exciting deep learning models in recent years. In this article, we will explore what is a generative adversarial network (GAN), why it works and its applications, as well as how to implement it using popular libraries like TensorFlow or Keras. We will also learn about some common terms used when discussing GANs, such as latent space, discriminator, generator, and loss function. Finally, we'll look at an example implementation of a GAN that generates handwritten digits and train it on the MNIST dataset using Python and Tensorflow library.

In summary, you should be able to understand what GANs are, their key components, and how to implement them using TensorFlow or other libraries. By doing so, you should be prepared to apply these techniques in your own projects and gain valuable insights into the world of generative modeling.

## 2.1 Generative Models
A generative model tries to learn the underlying distribution that generated the training data by generating new examples from scratch. These generated examples could be anything from images, audio clips, text documents, etc., depending on the problem being solved. 

In general, there are two types of generative models - discriminative and generative. A discriminative model takes an input and predicts the probability of whether it belongs to certain class(es). On the other hand, a generative model infers the probability density functions for different variables that were responsible for producing the given input. It then samples random values from those distributions to generate new outputs. The primary goal of both discriminative and generative models is to maximize their likelihoods of generating realistic-looking output while minimizing the likelihoods of fooling the classifier.

## 2.2 Discriminator
The discriminator is another name for the binary classification decision boundary between the true data and the synthetic data created by the Generator. The discriminator has two tasks:

1. To distinguish between the true data and the fake data produced by the generator.
2. To minimize the reconstruction error between the original image and its corresponding reconstructed image by the generator. This helps the generator improve its ability to produce convincing images that resemble the original ones.

## 2.3 Generator
The generator takes noise vectors as inputs and transforms them into samples that appear similar to the original data. During training, the generator learns to make progressively better approximations of the true data distribution by adjusting the parameters of its mapping network. As a result, the generator improves its capacity to reproduce the samples generated by itself, allowing it to control the synthesis process much more effectively than traditional approaches based on clustering.

## 2.4 Latent Space
Latent space refers to the space where all the intermediate representations learned by the neural networks are stored. It’s often referred to as the “bottleneck” because the observations in the original domain (e.g., images) tend to live in a high-dimensional but low-dimensional manifold within the latent space. The purpose of having a separate latent space is to prevent overfitting of the discriminator and allow the generator to focus only on improving the quality of the final output. However, if the dimensionality of the latent space becomes too large, the learning signal may begin to get diluted.

## 2.5 Loss Function
The objective of GANs is to generate a sample that appears to be realistic enough to trick the discriminator but not too confidently such that the discriminator fails to distinguish between the true and false samples. Therefore, the generator must be trained to reduce the discriminator's confidence in the generated samples. The standard approach in GANs is to use a combination of cross entropy and least squares error losses during training. Cross entropy is usually applied to the softmax activations of the discriminator on both the true and generated samples, while L2 norm is applied to the difference between the original and reconstructed images produced by the generator.
