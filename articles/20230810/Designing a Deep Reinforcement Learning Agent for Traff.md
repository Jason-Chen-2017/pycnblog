Traffic signal control is one of the most complex tasks in urban transportation systems such as metro cities and railways. To control traffic signals efficiently and effectively to prevent accidents or congestion, modern methods use advanced algorithms like deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In this work, we propose an agent-based DRL approach to optimize traffic signal timing using reinforcement learning techniques. We consider both longitudinal and lateral dynamics of road users, including cars, bikes, pedestrians and motorcycles, that influence their trajectories during traffic signal operations. We design an LSTM-DQN architecture to model these dynamic features based on vehicle motion patterns and time-of-day information. The proposed method can learn optimal signal timings through exploration and exploitation phases by interacting with real-world environments. 

The main contributions of our paper are:

1. A detailed description of how traffic signal control works at a microscopic level using mathematical equations and simulations. 

2. An implementation of a deep Q-network algorithm with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells to model user behavior based on motion and temporal context. 

3. Evaluation results demonstrating the efficacy of our DRL approach to optimize traffic signal timing across various scenarios.

4. A discussion on future research directions and challenges in applying DRL for traffic signal control.

# 2. Background Introduction
In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful tool for solving challenging problems in fields such as robotics, gaming, video games, etc., where the goal is to take actions in response to uncertain situations or rewards obtained from those actions. For instance, AlphaGo Zero uses deep reinforcement learning to beat the world's best Go player, MasterCard uses deep reinforcement learning to automate card payments, and Google DeepMind used deep reinforcement learning to train its AlphaGo artificial intelligence program. Despite significant advances in recent years, there remains a major challenge for application of deep reinforcement learning in traffic signal control. Specifically, traffic signal control involves complex interactions among different types of vehicles, which requires specialized models and algorithms to capture relevant factors affecting traffic flow and safety. Here, we present an agent-based DRL approach to optimize traffic signal timing using reinforcement learning techniques. Our approach combines deep neural networks (DNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) cells, and reinforcement learning algorithms to achieve robust and efficient solutions. This approach enables us to learn optimal signal timings through exploratory and exploitative phases by interacting with real-world environments.

To ensure continuous safe and smooth operation of traffic signals, several strategies must be employed to regulate the timing of lights. These include maintaining constant headway times, establishing minimum green times before changing the direction of travel, enforcing clearance requirements throughout all lanes, and setting up proper stopping procedures for motorists. However, current traffic signal control algorithms cannot fully exploit these factors since they typically focus only on either minimizing average delay or maximizing throughput. Therefore, in this project, we develop an agent-based DRL approach that optimizes traffic signal timing under varying conditions. By modeling dynamic features of road users such as car speed, headway time, acceleration, lane occupancy, and time-of-day, our agent learns to select optimal signal timings based on historical data and observing agent action sequences. Moreover, we integrate other components of traffic signal operation such as stop signs, yield signals, and barrier crossings into our framework to provide more comprehensive insights into the operational space. Additionally, we explore potential limitations of our approach by comparing against traditional optimization methods and considering realistic scenarios where traffic density increases due to disruptions or construction projects. Finally, we demonstrate our agent’s ability to automatically adjust the timing of traffic signals to minimize delay, increase efficiency, and avoid collisions.
