# 1.简介
         

Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a type of supervised learning method used for regression tasks where the output variable can take on only limited integer or real values. In contrast with traditional linear regression models, which use straight lines to estimate relationships between input and output variables, SVR learns a function whose inputs are considered more important than those whose outputs have larger influence on the prediction. The goal of an SVR model is to identify the hyperplane in space that has the smallest possible sum of squared errors, subject to certain constraints imposed by the problem domain. 

This article will explain the basic theory behind support vector regression models, including how they choose their hyperplane using kernel functions, how the optimization process works to find the optimal hyperplane, and what types of problems may be suited for this algorithm. We'll also look at code examples demonstrating how these algorithms work in Python. At the end, we'll suggest potential future developments in this area and discuss some common pitfalls when applying this algorithm to real-world data sets.

## Supervised Learning
Supervised learning refers to machine learning techniques that involve training models based on labeled training data consisting of input variables and corresponding desired output variables. Examples of supervised learning include classification, regression, and clustering.

In supervised learning, there exist two main categories of problems:

1. Classification problems - These problems involve predicting discrete class labels such as "positive" or "negative". For example, if we wanted to classify emails as either spam or not spam, our input variables would likely include words like "viagra", "buy", and "coupon"; while our output variables would represent whether each email was indeed spam or not. 

2. Regression problems - These problems involve predicting numerical outcomes. For example, if we were trying to predict the price of a house based on features like number of bedrooms, square footage, and location, our input variables would consist of these features; while our output variable would represent the actual selling price.

In both cases, we want to train a model that takes in new, unlabeled data and produces predictions about its expected output. To do so, we feed in a large amount of labeled data (the training data), which consists of pairs of input variables and corresponding output variables. This data gives us information about the patterns and trends within our dataset, allowing us to make accurate predictions about new, unseen data points.

## Linear Regression
Linear regression is a fundamental building block of supervised learning. It involves finding a line that fits well through a cloud of scattered data points, where one axis represents the input variable (explanatory variable) and the other represents the output variable (response variable). When applied to supervised learning problems, linear regression attempts to find the relationship between a set of input variables (X) and a single output variable (y). Here's how it works:

1. Define the hypothesis function H(x) = θ0 + θ1 * x. 
2. Choose random values for theta, i.e., θ0 and θ1.
3. For each pair of (x, y) values in the training data, compute the difference between the predicted output (h_x) and the true output (y):

error = h_x - y

4. Update the parameters θ0 and θ1 iteratively until convergence, minimizing the error across all samples: 

θ0 = θ0 - alpha * (sum(errors))
θ1 = θ1 - alpha * (sum((errors * X)))

5. Use the final values of θ0 and θ1 to make predictions on new, unseen data.

For simple linear regression, we assume that the input variables (X) have a direct impact on the output variable (y) without any nonlinear interactions or transformations. If this assumption does not hold, then a non-linear transformation can be included in step 1 above to transform the input variables into a higher dimensional feature space. However, keep in mind that a complex non-linear transformation might require much larger datasets to achieve good performance.

## Hyperplanes
A hyperplane is a subspace that lies between a set of points in a high-dimensional space. More specifically, it is a flat subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ that contains at least one point but no two points belong to the same subset. In n-dimensional space, any hyperplane can be expressed as $w^T x = w_{0}$, where $w$ is a normal vector pointing outwards from the hyperplane and $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, and $w_{0}$ is the offset parameter.
