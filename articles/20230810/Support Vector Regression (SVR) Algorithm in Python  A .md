# 1.简介
         

Support vector regression (SVR) is a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression problems. In this article, we will learn about the SVR algorithm using Python programming language. We will also perform an example project to illustrate how it works and its advantages over other linear algorithms such as linear regression. Let's get started!

# 2.算法概述
Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a powerful machine learning technique which can be applied to solve both regression and classification tasks with different types of data. It is based on the mathematical concept of support vectors and uses kernel functions to transform non-linear data into higher dimensionality space where it becomes linearly separable. The goal of the model is to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the predicted values and the actual target value while avoiding any errors or misclassifications. 

The key idea behind the SVM algorithm is to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates the training examples from each other. In order to achieve this, the algorithm calculates the distance between every pair of points and tries to minimize these distances so that they are smaller than a certain threshold called margin. However, there are many outliers in real-world datasets which cannot be easily separated from the others. To handle this issue, the authors introduced the soft margin constraint that allows some misclassification errors but still maintains the larger part of the margin needed for good separation. This property enables the use of SVMs even when the number of samples is very small compared to the number of features.

Therefore, the basic steps of the SVM algorithm are:

1. Choose a kernel function
2. Calculate the kernel matrix
3. Train the SVM classifier using Lagrangian multipliers

# 3.主要参数及意义
## 参数A
This parameter determines the penalty term added to the error function of SVM during optimization process. If this term is too large then the solution may not converge due to numerical instability. Setting the parameter close to zero encourages smooth decision boundary and avoids overfitting. On the other hand, if the parameter is set too low, it might miss some important information contained in the dataset. Thus, finding the right balance between high bias and variance is crucial. 

## 参数C
This parameter controls the tradeoff between regularization and loss of generalization ability. A large value of C leads to less regularization and more emphasis on preventing overfitting. Similarly, setting the parameter to small value reduces the amount of regularization and increases the risk of overfitting. Therefore, choosing the appropriate value of C depends on various factors like the complexity of the problem, size of training set, and performance metric.  

## 参数epsilon
Epsilon parameter specifies the threshold for the stopping criterion used to check convergence of SVM optimizer. By default, epsilon=0.1, which means that the optimizer stops after reaching at least one point within the specified interval. Decreasing the epsilon value makes the optimization slower but could lead to better results depending on the specific problem. Setting the epsilon parameter too low would result in longer computation time without significant improvement in accuracy. Hence, a good choice of epsilon parameter requires experimentation and fine tuning.  

## 参数gamma 
Gamma parameter specifies the scale factor of the radial basis function kernel. Gamma values below 1 make the kernel more sensitive to faraway points and gamma values above 1 make the kernel more localized around the training sample. Changing the gamma parameter often results in improved performance but comes with the cost of increased computational time. A good choice of gamma parameter is usually determined by cross-validation methodology.

# 4.Python代码实现
Before proceeding further let’s import the necessary libraries and generate random data for demonstration purpose. Here, I have generated two classes of data points with their corresponding labels. X_train contains feature variables of train set and y_train contains labels of those data points. Similarly, X_test contains feature variables of test set and y_test contains labels of those data points. Note that X should always contain only independent variables and not include dependent variable(y).

``` python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.svm import SVR
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score, mean_squared_error
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt


np.random.seed(0)
X_train = np.sort(np.random.rand(10, 1), axis=0)
y_train = np.sin(X_train).ravel()

X_test = np.arange(0.0, 1.0, 0.1)[:, np.newaxis]
y_test = np.sin(X_test).ravel()
```

In the following code block, I have defined the range of gamma parameters to search through. Then, I have created a dictionary containing all the possible combinations of parameters along with their respective ranges. Finally, I have used the GridSearchCV class of scikit-learn library to perform grid search across all the given combinations of parameters. 

``` python
gamma_range = [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100]

param_grid = dict(gamma=gamma_range)

svr = GridSearchCV(SVR(), param_grid=param_grid)
svr.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("Best Estimator: ", svr.best_estimator_)

y_pred = svr.predict(X_test)

mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print("MSE:", mse)
print("RMSE:", rmse)
print("R^2 Score:", r2)
```

After performing the grid search, I have obtained the best estimator with highest R^2 score. Next, I have performed predictions on the test set and calculated MSE, RMSE and R^2 scores. Now, we need to visualize the results to understand the underlying pattern in the data. Below, I am plotting the true values vs predicted values. As you can see, the plot fits well and shows no clear patterns of underfitting/overfitting. 

```python
plt.scatter(y_test, y_pred, color='black')
plt.plot([min(y_test), max(y_test)], [min(y_test), max(y_test)], color='blue', linewidth=3)
plt.xlabel('True Values')
plt.ylabel('Predictions')
plt.show()
```

We can now observe that the curve follows almost a straight line, showing good fit between the data points. 

Note: While building models for regression problems, we should always ensure that our features do not have any multi-collinearity issues. Multi-collinearity occurs when two or more predictor variables are highly correlated, resulting in unstable estimates of the coefficients of a regression equation. One way to detect multicollinearity is to calculate the correlation coefficient between each predictor variable. Any predictor variables whose absolute correlation coefficient is greater than 0.9 should be removed from the analysis.
