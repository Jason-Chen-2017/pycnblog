# 1.简介
         

        Long-term intensive exercise (LTE) is an essential component of physical activity in modern societies and plays a crucial role in maintaining a healthy body condition that can help prevent or relieve various diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension and heart failure. LTE is usually considered safe for most individuals, but some healthcare professionals advise against its use due to potential adverse effects on the central nervous system (CNS). 
        The goal of this study is to evaluate the environmental impacts of long-term intensive exercise on the CNS by comparing the changes in brain perfusion during LTE with a control condition where no exercise is performed. We are interested in identifying whether LTE improves blood flow through the CNS and promotes increased oxygen uptake in the brains of participants who undertake regular LTE exercises. 

        # 2.Terminology and Concepts

        ## Cell Types and Function

        ### Basal Ganglia

         - Motor circuits: Controls movement and emotional behavior. 
         - Associative learning: Allows quick integration of new information into working memory.
         - Tonic/Parasympathetic control: Modulates activity level between tachycardia (higher frequency beats than normal) and paradoxical/tachyarrhythmias (irregular beating pattern) signals from the EEG.
         - Gross Motor Control: Controls gross motor functions like balance, coordination, posture, and proprioception.

        ### Thalamic Nucleus

         - Respiration: Increases metabolic rate, decreases respiratory effort, and releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
         - Somatosensory cortex: Integrates multiple sensory inputs to produce awareness of external world.
         - Reward center: Promotes exploration and rewarding behaviors by modulating alertness, attention, motivation, and physiological responses to stressors.

        ### Hippocampal and Entorhinal Nuclei

         - Memory consolidation: Improves spatial orientation, spatial knowledge, short term memory, and problem solving skills.
         - Learning and memory storage: Stores past experiences and learned skills in both hippocampus (short term memory) and entorhinal area (long term memory).

       ## Blood Flow and Oxygen Uptake

       During long-term exercise, oxygen levels in the blood decrease significantly. This happens because LTE involves increased amounts of exertion and therefore more blood loss due to heat generated when the muscles relax after exercise. As a result, lower oxygen levels increase the risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is one of the leading causes of death among people over the age of 70 years old. To avoid AML, it's important to maintain optimal blood pressure during LTE exercises. 

       # 3.The Study Design

       The study will involve two groups of participants — those who take part in regular LTE exercises, and those who do not participate. Participants will wear a functional fitness tracker to measure their perfusion scores during LTE compared with controls without exercise. They will also receive baseline assessments before and after each exercise session to determine any changes in blood flow and oxygen levels within the CNS. Finally, they will complete a questionnaire about factors affecting their fitness, health, and lifestyle, as well as demographics data.
       The purpose of measuring perfusion levels using a functional fitness tracker is to provide objective and quantitative measures of how much blood flows through the CNS during different activities. By analyzing these results, researchers can identify patterns in the brain’s response to exercise and establish correlations between the amount of LTE and other conditions that may be related to poor CNS function. 
       Additionally, participants' noninvasive assessments will provide insights into the roles played by the thalamus, hippocampus, and entorhinal nucleus in improving neural flow and thereby reducing the risk of developing diseases associated with excessive LTE. Overall, the study aims to contribute to better understanding of LTE and its environmental influences on the CNS.
