        Probabilistic matrix factorization is a machine learning technique used to extract the underlying structure of sparse data in various fields such as recommender systems and bioinformatics. This algorithm can help identify hidden patterns and relationships within large datasets that are difficult or impossible to capture by traditional linear methods. In this article, we will understand how probabilistic matrix factorization works and implement it in Python. 
        
        ## 1.1 What is Probabilistic Matrix Factorization? 
        Probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) is an unsupervised machine learning method that uses both explicit ratings and implicit preferences to learn latent features for users and items from rating data. It generates two low-rank matrices, user factors and item factors, where each row represents a user or item, respectively, and each column corresponds to one of the latent dimensions. The algorithm learns these matrices iteratively by minimizing a convex objective function based on the inferred preferences between pairs of users and items. 
        
        A key difference between PMF and other recommendation algorithms like collaborative filtering is that PMF allows users' implicit feedbacks to influence the model's predictions. In traditional collaborative filtering, users give only positive ratings which are then aggregated into a single score for each item, while ignoring any negative feedback. In contrast, PMF takes into account both positive and negative ratings when training its models. Thus, it can better capture the underlying tastes and preferences of individual users and help recommend products they may have missed if not explicitly rated. 
        
        To enable efficient computation of pairwise probabilities, PMF computes estimates of conditional probabilities P(u | i), P(i | u), and P(u, i). These probability distributions encode the likelihood that a given user u rates an item i with a certain level of satisfaction, assuming their current setting of preferences and past behavior. These estimates are then incorporated into the loss function during training to improve the accuracy of the estimated preference values. 
       
        By combining explicit and implicit preferences, PMF can handle scenarios where some items or users have no positive ratings but still provide valuable information about user preferences and product popularity. Additionally, since it does not require a fixed set of pre-defined attributes for items and users, PMF can adapt easily to new types of data over time without requiring retraining.

       ## 2.1 Latent Features 
       Latent features refers to the hidden variables that represent high-dimensional structures or patterns present in complex data sets. In recommender systems, latent features can be thought of as abstract representations of users’ interests and preferences based on their past interactions with different items. They are also known as “latent classes” or “latent categories.” Essentially, they allow us to interpret and analyze complex data in an interpretable way without actually seeing all of the underlying details. In PMF, the user factors and item factors are examples of latent features learned by the algorithm based on user ratings and preferences. 
        
        There are several ways to define latent features in recommender systems. Some common approaches include:
        
        ### 2.1.1 Collaborative Filtering Approach
        Collaborative filtering is a type of recommendation system that predicts the rating that a user would assign to a specific item based on similarities between that user and others who have rated that item. In this approach, users’ ratings and preferences are treated as binary values indicating whether they have liked an item or disliked it. By looking at the similarities among these ratings, the algorithm infers latent features that describe the similarity between different items. For example, if two users tend to rate similar items highly, then those items might share a strong correlation in terms of latent features learned by the algorithm. 
        
        Another advantage of collaborative filtering is that it requires little training data, especially compared to content-based or knowledge-based recommendation systems. However, it suffers from problems such as sparsity and scalability because it cannot capture the complex relationships among vast amounts of data. Furthermore, it assumes that all missing values in the dataset are due to unavailable information, rather than because users did not like the item or did not have enough confidence in its value. 

        ### 2.1.2 Content-Based Recommendation System
       A content-based recommendation system relies on a description of the items being recommended to determine their suitability for a particular user. This description typically involves keywords related to the item’s characteristics and reviews provided by customers. Unlike collaborative filtering, the focus of a content-based system is on the content of the items themselves instead of users’ previous behavior. Therefore, content-based systems are less sensitive to noise and variability in user behavior.

       Within content-based systems, there are several techniques for generating latent features. One popular approach is to use natural language processing (NLP) tools to convert textual descriptions of items into numerical vectors representing the item’s content. Other methods involve using semantic analysis techniques like clustering or dimensionality reduction to group together similar items according to their shared characteristics. The resulting clusters can then be represented as collections of items that share similar features.

        While content-based recommendation systems offer advantages in terms of interpretability, they often do not produce accurate recommendations for all users and items. As a result, they may miss out on personalized suggestions or even lead to bad business outcomes if used without proper evaluation and optimization processes.
        
       ## 2.2 Implicit Feedback 
       Implicit feedback refers to situations where users express their preferences implicitly, such as clicking on advertisements or receiving emails promoting a product. In many cases, implict feedback provides more information than explicit ratings or preferences, but obtaining this kind of data remains challenging. Implicit feedback is particularly useful for online advertising platforms where users interact with ads based on their clicks, purchases, and engagement activities.

      In the context of PMF, implicit feedback makes up a third category of user preferences besides positive ratings and negative ratings. Since PMF focuses solely on explicit ratings, the importance of implicit feedback depends on the nature of the problem being addressed. If the goal is to suggest relevant items to users without taking into account their current preferences, implicit feedback may not provide much additional information beyond what has already been encoded in the ratings matrix. However, if the goal is to tailor the suggested items to match the user’s preferences, implicit feedback becomes essential.

      To incorporate implicit feedback into PMF, we need to distinguish between true and false positives in the case of binary ratings. True positives refer to cases where a user expresses positive sentiment towards an item, while false positives indicate negativity due to marketing campaigns or promotional offers. False negatives correspond to instances where a user fails to find an appropriate item, either because they have not found it on the platform or simply because they have no idea of what they are looking for. We need to make sure that our modeling takes these distinctions into consideration when updating the parameters of the generative model.

      Once we have identified the number of users and items, along with the explicit and implicit feedback data, we can proceed with defining the generative process of PMF.
  
  # 3.核心算法原理及具体实现过程

  ## 3.1 概念阐述
  
  Probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for collaborative filtering tasks. It combines both explicit ratings and implicit preferences to generate estimated latent feature vectors for users and items. Instead of directly optimizing the complete rating matrix, it approximates it with lower-rank matrices called user factors and item factors. Each user and item is represented by a vector of coefficients obtained by multiplying the corresponding rows of these matrices with the corresponding columns of the rating matrix. 
  
  ## 3.2 数据准备

  Before applying PMF, we first need to prepare the dataset containing user IDs, item IDs, ratings, timestamps, and optional metadata. Specifically, we must ensure that:
  
  * User IDs are unique integers starting from zero. 
  * Item IDs are unique integers starting from zero.
  * Ratings are real numbers ranging from 0 to 1 or from -1 to 1 depending on the application.
  * Timestamps record the order in which ratings were received. 
  * Metadata contains additional information about each item or user, such as demographics, preferences, or location. 

  
  After preprocessing the data, we split it into training and testing sets, and store them separately. 
  
  ## 3.3 模型生成

  ### 3.3.1 用户因子矩阵
  The user factor matrix $U$ has dimensions $(m \times k)$, where m is the number of users and k is the rank of the approximation. Its entries $\hat{u}_i^k$ represent the k-th component of the approximate representation of the i-th user, obtained by multiplying the i-th row of the rating matrix with the k-th column of U.
  
  ### 3.3.2 物品因子矩阵
  The item factor matrix $V$ has dimensions $(n \times k)$, where n is the number of items and k is again the rank of the approximation. Its entries $\hat{v}_j^k$ represent the k-th component of the approximate representation of the j-th item, obtained by multiplying the j-th column of the rating matrix with the k-th row of V.
  
  ### 3.3.3 用户偏好矩阵
  The user preference matrix $\Theta$ has dimensions $(m \times n)$, where each entry $(\theta_{ij})$ denotes the expected preference between user i and item j, obtained by summing up the predicted ratings for the ij-th element of the user factors and the item factors. Note that we assume that all elements of the user factors and item factors are non-negative.
  
  ### 3.3.4 隐性反馈
  The ability to take into account implicit feedback has led to significant improvements in many applications including recommender systems and bioinformatics. Here, we assume that the implicit feedback consists of four kinds of events:
   
  * Positive event: When a user clicks on an advertisement or checks out a product.
  * Negative event: When a user dismisses an ad or removes a review.
  * No-click event: When a user leaves the website without visiting any page before completing a purchase.
  * Abandonment event: When a user leaves the checkout process without making a payment.
  
  Given these events, we estimate the probability distribution of each event happening for each user and item combination, assuming their current settings of preferences and past behavior. We call this distribution $P_e$, where $p_e(u,i)$ represents the probability that user u experiences event e on item i.  
  
  Now, let's consider the joint probability distribution of observing a sequence of events E = {e1, e2,..., en} occurring simultaneously on user i and item j, given their prior settings P_p and P_e. We write
   
   $$P(\text{E}=E|\text{P}_{p}, \text{P}_{e}; \text{i}, \text{j})=\prod_{t=1}^n p_{\text{E}}(e_t;i,j)\left[p_{\text{P}}(e_1|u_1,\text{P}_{p})\cdots p_{\text{P}}(e_{t-1}|u_{t-1},\text{P}_{p})p_{\text{P}}(e_t|u_t,i,j,P_p;\text{E}^{<t})\right]$$
   
   Where $u_t=(u_t^{(1)},\ldots,u_t^{(k)})$ denotes the state of user i after t-1 events occur, and $e_t=(e_t^{(1)},\ldots, e_t^{(l)})$ is a vector of observed events.
   
  We want to maximize this probability distribution subject to certain constraints. First, we observe that $p_\text{E}(e_t;i,j)=p_{\text{P}}(e_t|u_t,i,j,P_p;\text{E}^{<t})$. Second, we note that the last term in the product depends on the sequence of previously experienced events up to time point t-1. Third, we assume that each observation e_t comes from a categorical distribution conditioned on the state of user i after t-1 events, and hence follows the same generative process as the original rating matrix. Finally, we constrain the entries of the user factors to be non-negative by ensuring that the dot product of a user factor vector and an item factor vector is greater than or equal to zero. 

  The above formulation forms the basis for the PMF model. Let's now derive the updates to the user and item factors, and explain why they satisfy the necessary conditions for convergence.
   
  ## 3.4 更新规则及收敛条件
  
  ### 3.4.1 更新用户因子
  We start by deriving the update rule for the user factors $\Delta u_i^{k+1}$, assuming that the remaining entries of the vector remain constant. We begin by writing down the posterior distribution $P(\text{U}_{i}\mid R, U, V, \Theta, P_p, P_e;\delta^k)$. Since we assume a Poisson distribution for the number of times a user views an item, the marginal probability mass function (pmf) of the user view count for item j given her rating profile $r$ is proportional to $r_j^{\mathrm{T}}\cdot \exp\{\beta_i\}$. Hence, we write
   
  $$\log P(\text{U}_{i}\mid R, U, V, \Theta, P_p, P_e;\delta^k) = \sum_{j=1}^n r_j^{\mathrm{T}} (\beta_i + \delta^k)^{\mathrm{-1}}\hat{u}_i^\top v_j$$
    
  Next, we perform gradient descent on the log-likelihood with respect to the user factor $\beta_i$ until convergence, obtaining the updated coefficient $\beta_i^{k+1}$ by setting $\beta_i^{k+1} = \arg\max_{\beta_i} \sum_{j=1}^n r_j^{\mathrm{T}} (\beta_i + \delta^k)^{\mathrm{-1}}\hat{u}_i^\top v_j$. The gradient of the log-likelihood with respect to $\beta_i$ is given by 
    
  $$\nabla_{\beta_i}\log P(\text{U}_{i}\mid R, U, V, \Theta, P_p, P_e;\delta^k)=-r_i+\sum_{j=1}^n r_jr_{ij}\frac{1}{1+\delta_jv_{ij}\hat{u}_i^\top}$.
    
  Using this expression, we obtain the update rule for the user factor vector $\delta_i^{k+1}$ as follows:
    
  $$\delta_i^{k+1}=(\Sigma^{-1}_{ji}-\delta^k\hat{u}_i^\top)(V^T\Sigma^{-1}_{ii}V+\lambda I)^{-1}(\Phi(R)_i+\beta_i^ku_i^{-\mathrm{T}})$$

  where $\Sigma_{ji}$ is the covariance matrix between user i and item j, $\Sigma_{ii}$ is the variance of user i, $\Phi(R)_i$ is the fraction of positive events for user i, and $\lambda$ is a smoothing parameter.
    
  ### 3.4.2 更新物品因子
  Similarly, we derive the update rule for the item factors $\Delta v_j^{k+1}$, assuming that the remaining entries of the vector remain constant. Again, we begin by writing down the posterior distribution of the item view counts given the rating profile of user i. Since we assume a Bernoulli distribution for whether a user views an item, the probability of viewing item j given her rating profile $r$ is simply the inner product of $r_j$ and the user factor vector $\hat{u}_i$. Hence, we write
    
  $$\log P(\text{V}_{j}\mid R, U, V, \Theta, P_p, P_e;\gamma^k) = \sum_{i=1}^m r_{ij} (\gamma_j + \gamma^k)^{\mathrm{-1}}\hat{u}_i^\top v_j$$

  Next, we perform gradient descent on the log-likelihood with respect to the item factor $\gamma_j$ until convergence, obtaining the updated coefficient $\gamma_j^{k+1}$ by setting $\gamma_j^{k+1} = \arg\max_{\gamma_j} \sum_{i=1}^m r_{ij} (\gamma_j + \gamma^k)^{\mathrm{-1}}\hat{u}_i^\top v_j$. The gradient of the log-likelihood with respect to $\gamma_j$ is given by

  $$\nabla_{\gamma_j}\log P(\text{V}_{j}\mid R, U, V, \Theta, P_p, P_e;\gamma^k)=r_j-\sum_{i=1}^mr_{ij}\frac{\gamma_j}{\gamma_j+\gamma^kv_j\hat{u}_i^\top}.$$

  Using this expression, we obtain the update rule for the item factor vector $\gamma_j^{k+1}$ as follows:

  $$\gamma_j^{k+1}=(\Sigma^{-1}_{ij}-\gamma^k\hat{v}_j^\top)(U^T\Sigma^{-1}_{jj}U+\lambda I)^{-1}(\Psi(R)_j+\gamma_j^kv_j\hat{u}_j)$$

  where $\Sigma_{ij}$ is the covariance matrix between user i and item j, $\Sigma_{jj}$ is the variance of item j, $\Psi(R)_j$ is the fraction of positive events for item j, and $\lambda$ is a smoothing parameter.


  ### 3.4.3 更新用户偏好矩阵
  The next step is to update the user preference matrix $\Theta$. Recall that $\Theta_{ij}$ is defined as the expected preference between user i and item j, which is computed by summing up the predicted ratings for the ij-th element of the user factors and the item factors. Therefore, we modify the standard EM algorithm to optimize the following loss function:
  
  $$\mathcal{L}(\Theta,\delta,\gamma,\mu)=\sum_{i,j}r_{ij}\left[\log p_{\text{B}}(r_{ij}|\hat{u}_i^\top v_j)-\log q_{ij}(\hat{u}_i,v_j,\Theta)\right]+\lambda\|U\|_2^2+\mu\|V\|_2^2$$
  
  where $\lambda$ controls the trade-off between regularization terms and $\mu$ controls the contribution of implicit feedback.
  
  Taking expectation wrt $q_{ij}(\hat{u}_i,v_j,\Theta)$ gives us:
  
  $$q_{ij}(\hat{u}_i,v_j,\Theta)=\sigma\big((\hat{u}_i^\top v_j +b_i) + \gamma_j\sum_{i'}(\Theta_{i'j} - b_{i'})\big)$$
  
  The optimal bias $b_i$ and scale $\sigma$ depend on the particular form of the sigmoid function used to compute $q_{ij}$. Here, we choose the logistic sigmoid function and minimize the squared error between the observed ratings and the expected ones computed using the user factors, item factors, and user preference matrix. We obtain the closed-form solution:
  
  $$\Theta_{ij}^{k+1}=\frac{(r_{ij}-\hat{u}_i^\top v_j-\gamma_j\sum_{i'}\Theta_{i'j'-1})(v_j^\top\delta_i+(1-\gamma_j)\sum_{i'}\delta_{i'}\Theta_{i'j'})}{v_j^\top\delta_i+(1-\gamma_j)\sum_{i'}\delta_{i'}\Theta_{i'j'}}.$$
  
  Finally, we repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence or until a maximum number of iterations is reached.

Here, we show a code implementation of PMF using Python libraries NumPy and SciPy. The code implements the PMF model outlined in section 3. We randomly generate a synthetic dataset consisting of 10 users, 20 items, and five random ratings per user/item pair, and train the model on this dataset using three initializations of the user and item factors. The output shows the top 10 recommendations for each user.
