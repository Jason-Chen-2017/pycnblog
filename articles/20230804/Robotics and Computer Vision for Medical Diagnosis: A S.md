         # 2.1背景介绍
         The medical imaging industry is expanding rapidly, with various modalities being used such as X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, MRS, PET, SPECT, Ultrasounds etc., which require specialist expertise to interpret correctly. To automate these processes, advanced methods have been developed based on machine learning algorithms, but they still struggle to meet the demands of modern day medical diagnostics. This can be attributed to several factors such as high complexity of the diagnostic problems involved, lack of sufficient data availability and variability, and large margin for error associated with noisy measurements. Furthermore, it becomes even more challenging when the clinical environments involve multiple hospitals with different operating rooms and patients’ preferences. Therefore, effective solutions for automated medical diagnosis are necessary to bridge the gap between computational models and practical medical procedures. This article reviews the state-of-the-art approaches taken by the medical imaging industry towards addressing these issues and explores future directions and applications of robotics and computer vision technologies in healthcare.  
 
 
         # 2.2基本概念术语说明
         Basic concepts and terminology needed to understand the context and approach of this paper include:
         
         1. Image segmentation: Image segmentation refers to dividing an image into smaller regions called segments, each segment representing an object present in the original image. It involves identifying and separating individual objects from their surroundings so that they may be analyzed independently of other parts of the scene. Image segmentation enables us to identify the boundaries of tissue, nuclei, blood vessels, cells, and organs in pathological images. We will use popular deep learning architectures such as Mask R-CNN, U-Net, and SegNet for image segmentation tasks.  
         
         2. Object detection: Object detection is a task of identifying and localizing specific objects in an image or video sequence. It is widely used in applications like traffic monitoring, autonomous vehicles, surveillance videos, and security systems. There are two types of object detectors - region proposal networks (RPN) and single shot detectors (SSD). RPNs propose bounding boxes around potential objects while SSD's detect objects in a sliding window fashion. Both of these detectors use deep convolutional neural networks trained on annotated datasets to produce accurate results.  
         
         3. GANs: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a type of generative model where two neural networks compete against each other in a game-theoretic sense. One network tries to generate realistic images while the other network tries to distinguish between fake and real images. GANS have shown significant promise in generating natural looking images, especially those in unstructured domains like medical imaging. Researchers have also proposed a new branch of GANs known as CycleGANS that enable cyclic translation between two domains without requiring paired training sets.  
         
         4. Human pose estimation: Human pose estimation is the process of identifying and estimating the position, orientation, and movement of human body joints in an image or a video stream. Key components of this problem include pose prior modeling, heatmaps, and keypoint regression. Popular frameworks include OpenPose and Stacked Hourglass Networks.  
         
         5. Action recognition: Action recognition is the identification and classification of human actions appearing in an image or a video stream. It is particularly useful in scenarios where we want to extract insights about a person’s activity level at any given moment. Various deep learning models have been proposed to address action recognition tasks including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).  
         
         6. Medical Terminologies: Medical terminologies refer to a set of standards and conventions used across all medical fields. They define terms such as “cancer”, “pneumonia” and “hernia” to provide meaning to medical data. These standardized sets of words play a crucial role in enabling communication between medical professionals, physicians, doctors, nurses, radiologists, pharmacists, and computers alike.
          
         7. Domain transfer: Domain transfer refers to transferring knowledge learned from one domain to another. For example, we can train a CNN on normal chest x-rays to recognize pneumonia and then apply it to CT scans to classify COVID-19 cases. Transfer learning helps in reducing time and cost spent on building models for every specific medical condition.
          
        # 2.3核心算法原理和具体操作步骤
        Now let's talk about how some popular methods in the field tackle the issues mentioned above and what does it involve?  
        ## 2.3.1 Image Segmentation Techniques 
        ### 2.3.1.1 U-Net
        
        **Introduction**
        

        **Proposed Solution**

        U-Net was designed to segment grayscale medical images into different classes such as background, tissues, and lesions. Each class is assigned a unique pixel value. The network consists of an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections to handle large spatial scale variations. The architecture uses three pooling layers and twelve contracting blocks followed by six upsampling blocks to achieve high-resolution feature maps throughout the network. 

        The input to the network is a batch of greyscale images. During training, the objective function encourages the outputs to match the ground truth pixels. At inference time, the output masks generated by the network are thresholded to obtain binary segmentations.

        **How Does it Work?**

        1. The input image passes through the first convolution block with a kernel size of $k$. The resulting features map is downsampled using a max pool layer with a factor of $2$, resulting in a tensor of shape $(H     imes W)$, where H and W are height and width dimensions respectively.  

           $$C_{in} = C_{out}, k=3$$

        2. The same feature map goes through five convolutional blocks with increasing filters sizes until reaching the bottleneck block with filter size equal to twice the number of previous block's output channels.   

           $$C_{in} = C_{out}    imes{2}^{    ext{(block index)}}$$


        3. After the second convolution block, each subsequent block reduces its spatial dimensionality by a factor of $\frac{2}{3}$. The final output has a spatial resolution of $\frac{H}{    ext{final\_num\_blocks}}$.  

        4. Finally, the output feature maps pass through five convolutional blocks with kernel size $1$ and increase the number of filters by a factor of ${2}^{    ext{(upsample\_index)}}$. The resultant feature maps have higher spatial resolution than the input image. 

        5. The output feature maps are concatenated with corresponding downsampled versions of the feature maps obtained during contraction phase. This concatenation is done after applying a convolution operation with kernel size $1$. Then the concatenated feature map is passed through four fully connected layers with dropout regularization. The last layer produces the final mask prediction.  


       ## 2.3.1.2 Mask R-CNN 

        ### Introduction
        Mask R-CNN is a technique for object detection and instance segmentation. It is based on Faster R-CNN architecture with additional modules to perform instance segmentation. The main idea behind Instance Segmentation is to divide an image into different instances of the same category separately instead of simply categorizing each object as a whole image.


        ### Proposed solution
        Mask R-CNN is built upon the Faster R-CNN framework. The key difference lies in the way it treats bounding box coordinates. Instead of predicting only class labels and confidences, it predicts pixel-wise localization masks along with class labels and confidences. The bounding boxes represent regions inside the image where the object exists, whereas the masks contain exact information about the extent and location of the object in the image. 




            Figure: Comparison of Faster RCNN and Mask RCNN approaches for object detection. Faster RCNN generates a list of candidate bounding boxes and per-class scores for each anchor point. Mask RCNN further generates a per-pixel probability distribution over classes and instances using the candidate proposals. By combining the predictions from both stages, Mask RCNN achieves better accuracy compared to Faster RCNN.
            
        ### How does it work?
        1. First, the backbone ResNet-FPN feature extractor extracts multi-scale features from the input image.
        2. Then, the RPN module identifies regions of interest (ROIs) in the feature maps produced by the feature extractor. It proposes regions that might contain objects with different aspect ratios and scales. 
        3. Next, RoI Align operator performs bilinear interpolation to convert ROIs into fixed-size feature vectors. These feature vectors serve as inputs to the shared convolutional heads.
        4. The head branches divide into three sub-networks - cls, bbox, and mask - for predicting object categories, bounding boxes, and segmentation masks respectively.
        5. The cls subnet takes the shared conv features as input and outputs predicted object probabilities for each anchor point. The bbox subnet additionally outputs predicted offsets for the center points of the bounding boxes.
        6. The mask subnet provides a soft mask prediction for each pixel in the bounding box region.

        ### Importance of instance segmentation
        Besides detecting the presence of objects of the same category, instance segmentation focuses on discovering and understanding the properties of individual objects. Some examples of interesting applications of instance segmentation include car damage detection, industrial defect analysis, and microscope slide preparation.


    ## 2.3.1.3 Cascade R-CNN 

    ### Introduction
    Cascade R-CNN is a variation of Faster R-CNN that adds cascade network architectures to improve object detection performance. This method introduces cascaded representations computed from increasingly precise classifiers, leading to improved recall and precision levels simultaneously. Cascades come from a mathematical concept of graph theory, where nodes correspond to different stages in the object detection pipeline, and edges denote dependencies among the stages. 

    ### Proposed solution

    Similar to Faster R-CNN, Cascade R-CNN relies on an alternating classifier-regressor mechanism to detect objects in an image. However, unlike traditional faster R-CNN, it applies multiple object detectors sequentially, each specialized in a different part of the object detection pipeline, thereby improving robustness and efficiency. Specifically, the algorithm employs three components to implement the cascade:

    1. Region Proposal Network (RPN): This component computes initial set of possible object locations.
    2. Detection Network: This component aims to predict objects' bounding boxes and classifications directly from the RPN proposals.
    3. Joint Inference Engine: This component combines the output of RPN and detection networks to compute final detections. 
    
    Each stage makes its own predictions and contributes to overall score calculation. Overall, the algorithm avoids over-fitting and converges towards better generalization.
    
    ### How does it work?
    
    1. Input Image -> Feature Extractor -> Region Proposal Network (RPN) 
    
       The RPN module takes the extracted features from the backbone network and produces a set of candidate object locations by extracting a small set of anchors from each pixel in the feature map. These anchors are filtered using non-maximum suppression (NMS) to remove duplicates and eliminate false positives before entering the next stage. 

    
    2. Output From RPN -> Detection Network 

       The detected candidates from the RPN are fed into the detection network, which follows the same steps as Faster R-CNN - selective search for region proposal generation, region of interest pooling, and convolutional neural network for classification and bounding box regression. These outputs are collected into fixed length feature vectors that describe the characteristics of the detected objects.     

    3. Results From Detection Network -> Classify + Regression (Inference engine)

       As the detection network predicts the bounding boxes and classifications for each candidate, they are combined to produce a final detection output. The inference engine then applies a linear combination of confidence scores to combine the outputs of each stage to produce the final detection output. The final result contains a set of predicted bounding boxes, classifications, and object masks.


    ## 2.3.1.4 YOLO

    ### Introduction 
    You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a popular algorithm for object detection and tracking. It is very lightweight and easy to deploy compared to other detection algorithms. 

    ### Proposed Solution 
  
    YOLO is simple and efficient because it makes few assumptions about the dataset it works with. Unlike other detection algorithms, YOLO operates on a full-sized image rather than a feature pyramid. The major advantage of YOLO is its speed, specifically with respect to real-time processing of video feeds. Other detection algorithms typically run at 30-50 frames per second, but YOLO runs in real-time with 45 fps, making it ideal for applications such as self-driving cars, automation, and embedded systems.

    ### How does it work? 
    1. Converting an image into a feature vector 
       An image is processed through a pre-trained darknet-53 CNN architecture. The output of the base network is divided into grid cells containing a predetermined number of anchor boxes. These anchor boxes encode features that characterize the objects contained in the cell.

    2. Predicting bounding box parameters and object classes 
       The predicted bounding box and class probabilities are converted to actual bounding box coordinates and classifications using sigmoid activation functions. The intersection-over-union metric is used to evaluate the quality of predicted bounding boxes.

    3. Post-processing detection results 
       Bounding boxes that overlap too much or fall outside the image bounds are removed, while duplicate detections are averaged together using non-maximum suppression (NMS).
