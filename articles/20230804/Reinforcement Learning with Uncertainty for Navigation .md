Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning that enables agents to learn by trial-and-error interaction with the environment and achieving rewards over time. In recent years, RL has been applied successfully in various real-world applications such as game playing, robotics control, autonomous driving, etc. However, there are several challenges when applying RL algorithms to navigation problems in complex obstacles. The most challenging one is that the agent cannot always accurately determine the exact position or orientation of its target object due to limited sensor information and uncertainty. To address this challenge, we propose a new approach called Bayesian reinforcement learning with uncertainties (Bayesian RL), which uses probabilistic models to represent the unknown factors that influence the agent's actions. We introduce four key components into our framework to enable Bayesian RL: belief propagation, action selection using Bayes' rule, state estimation, and reward function design. By combining these components, we can achieve robust and scalable navigation in dynamic environments with uncertain obstacles. 

In this article, we will first explain the basic concepts, terminologies, and mathematical formulas used in Bayesian reinforcement learning with uncertainties. Then, we will present an overview of Bayesian RL algorithmic steps and operations. Finally, we will provide a step-by-step guide on how to implement Bayesian RL in simulation and experiment with different scenarios. This work is expected to inspire further research in this area and stimulate discussions on future directions.

Before diving deeper into the main body of the paper, let’s understand some related works that have made progress towards addressing similar issues of navigation in complex obstacles. Some other promising approaches include Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Both DRL and MCTS use deep neural networks to approximate the value functions and policies, respectively. However, they both struggle from limited exploration of the search space and lack the ability to capture the uncertainty in the environment. Therefore, it remains an open question whether incorporating prior knowledge about the environment through human experience could be effective in dealing with such challenging tasks. Recently, many researchers proposed solutions based on particle filters and Kalman filtering to handle partial observability and model noise, respectively. These methods mainly focus on reducing the variance of estimates but do not fully leverage the power of probabilistic reasoning techniques. Moreover, these methods fail to generalize well to unseen situations because their predictions require large amounts of training data, making them less efficient compared to Bayesian models. On the contrary, Bayesian RL addresses these limitations by leveraging probabilistic models instead of frequentist statistics and incorporates prior knowledge explicitly in the modeling process. 

To summarize, there are many existing works that tackle the problem of navigation with uncertainty and complex obstacles. However, none of them fully exploits the potential of Bayesian inference to enhance the decision-making capabilities of autonomous vehicles and intelligent agents. Our proposed solution combines the strengths of deep neural networks with probabilistic reasoning principles to effectively deal with uncertain environments and significantly improve navigation performance.

The following subsections describe the basic concepts, terms, and mathematical formulas that are essential for understanding the technical details of our Bayesian RL methodology.


## Belief Propagation
Belief propagation is a popular technique for performing probabilistic inference. It involves computing marginal probabilities and conditional probabilities between variables given observations. It is widely used in image processing, speech recognition, computer vision, and statistical analysis fields. Given a set of random variables $X_1, X_2,..., X_n$, the goal of belief propagation is to compute the joint probability distribution $\Pr(X_1, X_2,..., X_n)$ or any subset of the variables conditioned on the rest of the variables.

In our case, each variable represents a hypothesis about the pose of the agent at a specific moment in time. The hypotheses are represented by probability distributions over possible configurations of the pose, i.e., ${\bf x} \sim {\mathcal P}(x|{\bf z}_t)$. The observation at time t contains noisy measurements of the current state of the world, including the true location of the target object (${\bf o}_t$) and possibly other objects (${\bf o'}_t$). The joint likelihood of all these factors is denoted as $p({\bf z}_t, {\bf x}, {\bf o}_t, {\bf o'}_t)$. Intuitively, we want to update our estimate of the state of the world after seeing the measurement. That is, given the previous estimate of the state ${\bf x}_{t-1}$, we want to calculate the updated posterior distribution over the next state ${\bf x}_t$, $p({\bf x}_t|{\bf x}_{t-1})$.

One way to perform belief propagation is by treating each variable independently, updating its own probability distribution based only on its parents. Specifically, if variable $X_i$ depends on variables $X_1,...,X_{i-1}$ and their values are known ($Z_1=z_1, Z_2=z_2,...,Z_{i-1}=z_{i-1}$), then we can recursively compute the conditional distribution of $X_i$ given the parent values as follows:

 $$P(X_i = x_i | X_1 = z_1,..., X_{i-1} = z_{i-1}) = \frac{P(X_i = x_i, X_1 = z_1,..., X_{i-1} = z_{i-1})}{P(X_1 = z_1,..., X_{i-1} = z_{i-1})}$$

We repeat this procedure until all nodes in the network receive messages from all their neighbors, resulting in the joint probability distribution over all variables in the network. The final result gives us an approximation of the true posterior distribution.

## Action Selection Using Bayes' Rule
When planning a sequence of actions, the agent typically needs to choose the best ones based on their long-term consequences. One common strategy for selecting actions is to take the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimate of the action probability, assuming a prior over the action space. MAP can be computed as follows:

  $$    ext{MAP}(A|O, B) := \underset{a}{\arg\max}\ P(A=a|O,B)\approx \underset{a}{\arg\max}\ P(A=a, O|\pi_{    heta}(.|B))\approx \underset{a}{\arg\max}\ \log\ P(A=a, O|\pi_{    heta}(.|B))+H(\pi_{    heta}(.|B))$$

Here, $A$ is the action being considered, $O$ is the observed evidence, and $B$ is the prior knowledge. The term $\pi_{    heta}(.|B)$ is the policy parameterized by $    heta$ representing the agent's preferences, behavioral strategies, and internal models. The entropy $H(\pi_{    heta}(.|B))$ measures the amount of exploration required to find good actions under the given prior.

However, while MAP provides a principled way to select actions, it assumes that the prior is uniform across all possibilities. Instead, we need to consider the effect of the prior on the agent's decision-making process. For example, assume that the agent knows that there exists an obstacle within certain distance ahead and wants to avoid it. If the prior is completely uniform, it might ignore this information and blindly follow the path that minimizes total energy consumption. This may lead to collisions or worse behaviors. To account for this fact, we need to modify our prior knowledge to incorporate the effect of the knowledge of the obstacle. Thus, rather than assuming a uniform prior, we should weight the different action options based on their risk/reward tradeoff with respect to the presence of the obstacle.

In order to apply Bayesian inference to action selection, we can use Bayes' rule to update our belief about the action taking place given the observations and the prior knowledge. Specifically, given a set of actions $\mathcal A=\{a_1,\ldots,a_K\}$, the posterior distribution over the chosen action is calculated as follows:

  
   $$    ext{Posterior}(a^*|O) \propto P(a^*=a^*,O|\pi_{    heta}(.|B))\cdot P(B|O)$$

This formula says that the likelihood of choosing action $a^*$ given the observations is proportional to the product of two factors: the likelihood of observing $O$ under the selected action $\pi_{    heta}(.|B)$ multiplied by the prior probability of having observed those observations without knowing anything about the action taken.

Thus, we end up with a distribution over possible actions $P(a^*=a^*|O)$ that reflects both the expertise of the agent and the uncertainties in the environment. The choice of action becomes the one maximizing this distribution subject to the constraints imposed by the prior.


## State Estimation
State estimation refers to the task of predicting the future states of the system based on past observations and interactions. As mentioned earlier, the observations contain noisy measurements of the current state of the world, which can potentially cause errors in prediction. To mitigate this issue, we can use Gaussian processes to construct a probabilistic model of the dynamics of the system. A Gaussian process is a collection of random variables that are assumed to behave like a stochastic process. When evaluated at a particular point in time, the GP produces a continuous-valued random variable, whose mean and variance encode our confidence in the predicted value. We can also use sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to propagate the state distribution forward in time, generating samples that provide more accurate predictions and exploring regions of high uncertainty.

Our objective here is to develop a representation that captures the uncertainty in the state of the agent and encodes our prior knowledge about the environment. We can use a combination of a deterministic part and a probabilistic part to represent the state of the agent, where the deterministic component corresponds to the physical features of the agent itself (position, velocity, heading) and the probabilistic component represents the non-deterministic aspects of the agent's state, e.g., its estimated range to the target object and the visibility of surrounding obstacles.

Specifically, we can define the state of the agent as $(d, r_w, v_w, q_w)$, where $d$ represents the distance traveled since the last observation, $r_w$ is the range to the target object, $v_w$ is the angular velocity around the target object, and $q_w$ is the orientation of the vehicle relative to the tangent plane perpendicular to the direction of travel along the centerline of the road. We can assume that these quantities are drawn from independent Gaussian distributions, allowing us to encode our prior knowledge about the environment in terms of standard deviation parameters and covariance matrices.

Once we have defined our state representation, we can proceed to estimate its value based on past observations. We start by inferring the joint density of the full state vector $(d, r_w, v_w, q_w)$ given the observations, which can be done via Markov chain monte carlo (MCMC) sampling of the latent state and integrating out the observation variables. Once we have inferred the full state vector, we can use linear regression or kernel methods to fit a surrogate model of the dynamics of the system. The surrogate model takes as input the full state vector and outputs a predicted value for the next state. We can evaluate the accuracy of our estimator on a validation dataset and tune hyperparameters to optimize its performance.

Another important aspect of state estimation is regularization, which helps reduce overfitting to small variations in the training dataset. One commonly employed regularization technique is the shrinkage operator, which weights the contribution of each dimension in the state vector according to its precision matrix. With this approach, we can prioritize dimensions that are more informative for estimating the state, thus encouraging the model to maintain smoothness and adapt to changes in the environment.

Overall, the goal of state estimation is to obtain an accurate estimate of the full state of the agent given its noisy observations, accounting for the effects of the uncertainty in the underlying model and the prior knowledge encoded in the initial conditions.

## Reward Function Design
Reward functions play a critical role in reinforcement learning systems. They serve as the feedback signal that drives the agent to act optimally and discover desirable behaviors. There are several ways to design a reward function for navigation with uncertainty, depending on the nature of the task at hand. Here, we discuss two types of reward functions - terminal rewards and intermediate rewards. 


### Terminal Rewards
Terminal rewards refer to the immediate reward obtained at the end of episodes, which occur when the agent reaches the destination or encounters an irreversible event, such as running out of fuel or colliding with an obstacle. Typically, the discount factor plays a crucial role in determining the importance of early versus late rewards, especially in sparse reward settings where subsequent events often have diminishing returns. Additionally, terminal rewards help balance the exploration vs. exploitation dilemma encountered during training.

For navigation tasks, terminal rewards can be designed in different ways. In some cases, the agent receives a positive reward only if it completes the mission successfully, while in others, additional negative rewards can be added for deviating from a desired trajectory or slowing down before reaching the destination. Similarly, another form of terminal reward can depend on the level of damage suffered by the agent, causing it to terminate prematurely.

An interesting aspect of terminal rewards is that they offer a direct measure of success, enabling the agent to directly compare its performance against other agents in a benchmarking setting. Yet, the natural biases introduced by the environment (such as collision avoidance, traffic lights, pedestrian crossings, etc.) can prevent the agent from obtaining perfect scores consistently, leading to inconsistent comparisons.


### Intermediate Rewards
Intermediate rewards refer to the intrinsic reward obtained at every timestep throughout an episode. These rewards typically come from assessing the quality of the current state and guiding the agent towards better outcomes. While terminal rewards offer a direct measure of success, intermediate rewards give more fine-grained insights into how well the agent is navigating.

There are several ways to design intermediate rewards for navigation tasks. One simple approach is to assign incremental or binary rewards for proximity to the target object or approaching obstacles. This allows the agent to explore the environment and gradually build trust in its learned skills. Another option is to penalize the agent for deviations from the intended course or speed. This can encourage the agent to plan routes that minimize risks and get to the destination efficiently.

Another advantage of intermediate rewards lies in their flexibility and modularity. Since they are based solely on local perception, they can be implemented in a modular fashion and combined together to create sophisticated reward functions. Furthermore, they don't rely on explicit representations of the target object or the environment, allowing the agent to navigate in an entirely novel environment.
