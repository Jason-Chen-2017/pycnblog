         ## 1. Background introduction 
         在现代高等教育中，学生不仅要学习知识、技能、技巧等有形无形的职业技能，还需要处理好学习时的多任务复杂性。传统的教学方式之所以如此，是因为在过去的学习过程中，老师只负责给予学生一堂课的内容，并在课后期末考试中评判学生的成绩。但这种学习方式并非真正的学生学习能力的体现，而且也会影响到学生的进一步发展。通过本文的研究，希望能够揭示学生在自主学习时遇到的各种困难和问题，并提出相应的解决办法，从而帮助学生更好地掌握知识，掌握技能，实现全面发展。
       
         从另一个角度上说，学校的教育模式和培养目标往往都存在着不足，比如单一化、强制性、职业化等，都会影响学生在自主学习能力上的发展。然而，当教师和学生结合起来探索自身的潜力，利用多种方法（包括课外阅读、作业辅导、志愿服务、项目管理）来进行有效的教学，通过精准的反馈机制来激发学生的创造力和解决问题的能力，不仅能够使学生受益匪浅，而且也有助于培养学生的综合素质、独立思维、协同工作、团队精神等核心竞争力。
       
         ## 2. Basic Concept and Terms
         ### 2.1 Definition
         
         **Multi-tasking** (also known as multitasking) refers to a process in which multiple tasks are performed simultaneously by a single worker or group of workers.[1] In other words, it is an approach where different components of the work must be accomplished at once without any interruption or delay between them.

         **Learning outcome**: A measure that indicates how well students have learned a particular skill or knowledge. Learning outcomes can vary based on many factors such as ability, motivation, time management skills, performance, etc.

         **Behavioral insights:** Insights derived from student behavior that reveal their learning preferences, abilities, aspirations, and motivations. Behavioral insights provide valuable information about how students perceive certain concepts, situations, behaviors, and ideas. Behaviors like procrastination, attention deficit disorder (ADD), hyperactivity, impulsivity, among others, can lead to low grades in school and later life.

        **Thematic maps**: Maps used to visualize complex subject matter by breaking down the topics into smaller chunks and identifying connections between related concepts. Thematic maps help teachers understand the relationships between various concepts and activities, enabling them to create effective learning environments for their classes. They also enable students to easily access the material they need when studying specific subjects.
        
        **Reflective writing:** An important method used to analyze students' written responses after graduation, and provide feedback to enhance student's understanding of what they have learned. Reflective writing helps students reflect upon their learning experience and identify strengths and weaknesses, enabling them to improve themselves. This technique has been shown to increase student achievement and success levels.

         ### 2.2 Types of multi-tasking
         
         **Co-occurrence tasking:** Co-occurrence tasking involves performing several tasks together within a period of time to complete a larger goal. For instance, during a test taking semester, the teacher may ask one classmate to assist with a problem while another is completing an essay. Co-occurrence tasking often leads to higher engagement in each individual task and improved performance. However, it can sometimes cause confusion and conflict if not done carefully.
         
         **Concurrent tasking:** Concurrent tasking occurs when two or more tasks are occurring at the same time, allowing students to switch focus between them as needed. It can be beneficial for students who want to practice critical thinking, but can interfere with productivity and concentration if overused.
         
         **Alternating tasking:** Alternating tasking involves having two or more similar tasks to perform in sequence, with each pair of tasks separated by breaks in between so that students can learn independently. While this type of tasking can benefit some individuals, it does not offer a comprehensive view of all aspects of a subject, leading to limited retention of knowledge.

         
         **Spaced repetition:** Spaced repetition is a memory technique that involves revisiting old material again and again throughout the day until it becomes fresh and new information is remembered. By practicing spaced repetition, students retain new knowledge longer than if they just memorized it once. However, spaced repetition also poses its own set of challenges: excessive recall can lead to forgetfulness, and using too few attempts can lead to poor retention of long term patterns. 

         
         **Habits/ routines:** Habits and routines refer to daily practices, rituals, and regularities that promote healthy living and contribute to personal development. Excessive use of habits and routines can negatively impact learning progress and result in depression and anxiety. To combat these issues, teachers should encourage students to break away from traditional ways of working and adopt new ways of doing things that complement their existing mental health conditions.
