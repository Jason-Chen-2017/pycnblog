         Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network that is particularly effective for processing and analyzing time series data. In this article, we will explore how they work under the hood to gain insights into their internal mechanisms and algorithms, as well as discuss some of the applications of LSTMs in natural language processing, speech recognition, and other fields. 
         
         This article assumes familiarity with basic machine learning concepts like neural networks, feedforward propagation, backpropagation through time (BPTT), and gradient descent. Additionally, it should also be noted that while we focus on understanding the technical details behind these models, practical applications of them still require more advanced knowledge, including problem formulation, data preprocessing, model optimization techniques, etc. We will not cover all those topics here, but we hope you can understand why researchers have created LSTMs and how they work by going over their inner workings.

         Before diving into the nitty-gritty details of LSTMs, let’s first go over the fundamental terms and notation used throughout the article. 

         ## Time Series Data

         Time series data refers to a sequence of measurements made at regular intervals over time. It may include stock prices, weather reports, news articles, sales records, or any other data that is collected over time. Examples of commonly used time series datasets include daily temperature readings, monthly visitor numbers, monthly product demand trends, and so on. 


         *Fig 1: Example time series dataset of monthy visitor counts from different cities.*


         The temporal dimension plays an important role in time series data because it allows us to capture patterns that change over time. For example, if we had a time series consisting of daily sales figures for a retail company, we could identify seasonality effects such as increases in sales during Christmas and sales peaks during sales promotions. Similarly, if we were given time series data about airplane flight delay times, we might detect periods where flights experience delays due to issues with maintenance crews, or delays that correspond to congested areas of the city.

         
         ## Sequential Model vs. Feedforward Network

         A sequential model is a type of artificial neural network that processes input sequences one element at a time, just like a human being would do when reading sentences or words sequentially. These models learn to make predictions based on past inputs and use feedback to adjust the weights of neurons accordingly. Here's an illustration of what a typical sequential model architecture looks like: 



         *Fig 2: Typical sequential model architecture. Input sequence is processed layer by layer using learned weights.*



         On the other hand, a feedforward network consists of fully connected layers, meaning each node in one layer is connected to every node in the previous layer. Unlike sequential models, feedforward networks cannot process input sequences directly. Instead, they rely on feature engineering methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to extract features from raw data before passing them forward through the network.

         
        ## Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)

        BPTT stands for “backpropagation through time”, which is an algorithmic approach to updating the weights of a neural network during training. During each iteration of the training loop, the gradients of the loss function with respect to the output nodes are calculated using backpropagation. However, since RNNs involve multiple time steps, calculating the gradients for each step independently requires a nested loop structure called BPTT. 

        To optimize performance, researchers developed several extensions to traditional BPTT that allow for parallel computations across multiple time steps. One common method is truncated BPTT, which only computes gradients for a limited number of time steps and then resets the network state to continue processing remaining input data. Another extension is long short-term memory (LSTM), which adds additional gate mechanisms to control the flow of information between time steps.


        ## Gradient Descent Optimization Algorithm

        Gradient descent is a popular optimization technique used to update the weights of a neural network after computing the gradients using backpropagation. It works by moving the parameters in the direction opposite to the gradient until convergence. There are many variants of gradient descent, each with its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the specific context and problem being solved. Here's an overview of various gradient descent optimization algorithms:

        1. Batch Gradient Descent: Computes the gradient over the entire dataset and updates the weights once per epoch. Fastest convergence speed, least stable.

        2. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): Samples random mini batches from the dataset and updates the weights after each batch. Good stability compared to batch GD, slower than batch GD.

        3. Mini-batch Gradient Descent: Combines SGD and batch GD, samples fixed size mini batches from the dataset and updates the weights after each mini batch. Provides better stochasticity than both SGD and batch GD.

        4. Adagrad: Uses a separate adaptive learning rate for each weight parameter and adapts the learning rate over time based on historical gradients. Works well for sparse data and unbalanced datasets.

        5. Adam: Combines ideas from momentum and AdaGrad, uses momentum to smooth out the gradients and AdaGrad to adaptively scale the learning rates. Usually converges faster than SGD or batch GD.

     
        
        ## Long Short-Term Memory Units (LSTMs)

         An LSTM unit has two main components - the cell state and the hidden state. Both states are initialized to zero, and they interact with each other over time to help remember past events and predict future ones. They receive input from outside sources, process it through weighted sums, and apply non-linear transformations to create new values for both the cell state and the hidden state. The overall effect of this interaction is that the LSTM learns to selectively remember relevant pieces of input history, and to generate outputs that anticipate upcoming events based on current contextual cues.


         *Fig 3: Illustration of how an LSTM unit functions. The cell state is updated based on the input at each time step, and the hidden state is formed by applying activation functions to the cell state.*




         LSTMs offer several benefits over standard RNN architectures, including improved accuracy, longer-term dependencies, and efficient computation. Some of the key benefits of LSTMs include:

            1. Learning Longer Dependencies: LSTMs can effectively handle long-term dependencies without the vanishing gradient problem found in traditional RNNs. As a result, LSTMs are often used in tasks such as natural language processing and speech recognition, where accurate modeling of recent context is essential.

           
            2. Effective Computation: LSTMs exploit gating mechanisms that enable the network to selectively remember and forget certain parts of input history, making them capable of handling variable-length sequences efficiently. With careful design of the LSTM cells, LSTMs can perform well even on large datasets.

             
            3. Easy Training: Because of their intrinsic properties, LSTMs are easier to train than standard RNNs. Regularization techniques, such as dropout, also help prevent overfitting and improve generalizability of the trained model.

 

                             ## Applications of LSTMs

                        By now, we've covered the basics of LSTMs and their inner working mechanism, along with some of its applications in natural language processing, speech recognition, and other fields. Let's move onto some examples to get a deeper insight into how LSTMs operate.


                        ### Natural Language Processing

                        In natural language processing, LSTMs are widely used for text classification, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition. These tasks typically involve classifying whole sequences of text into predefined categories.

                        Here's how an LSTM model for sentiment analysis works:

                        1. Preprocess the input text by tokenizing, converting to lowercase, removing stopwords, and stemming or lemmatizing.

                        2. Create word embeddings for each token, either randomly initializing vectors or using pre-trained word embedding models.

                         
                        
                        *Fig 4: Example sentence encoding with word embeddings.*

                        3. Pass the embedded sentence representation through an LSTM layer with a specified number of units. Each unit takes in the concatenation of the preceding output vector $h_{t−1}$ and the corresponding embedded word vector $    ilde{x}_t$, applies linear transformations to compute a candidate value for the cell state $c_t$, and applies sigmoid and tanh activations to compute the hidden state $h_t$.

                         
                        
                        *Fig 5: Visualization of the LSTM cell operation.*

                        4. Apply another set of linear and activation functions to the final output $o_t$ of the LSTM layer to obtain a probability distribution over labels.

                         
                        
                        *Fig 6: Example output of the LSTM classifier for sentiment analysis.*


                                 ### Speech Recognition

                                In speech recognition, LSTMs are also commonly used to recognize spoken words and phrases. When a user speaks, microphone recordings are sent to a cloud-based speech-to-text engine that processes the audio signal and converts it into text. 

                                Here's how an LSTM model for speech recognition works:

                                 1. Record sound from the microphone buffer at a sample rate of 16 kHz or higher.

                                  2. Convert the sampled waveform into frames of audio of a uniform duration (such as 20 ms).

                                   
                                   
                                    
                                    *Fig 7: Microphone recording of a speech utterance.*

                                     3. Compute FFT spectra for each frame and convert them into filter banks, representing the spectral content of the audio signal.

                                       
                                       
                                         
                                         *Fig 8: Spectral filter bank for audio signal.*

                                          4. Use the filter banks to represent the frequency spectrum of the input signals, pass them through an LSTM layer, and concatenate the resulting representations at each time step to form the input to the next layer.

                                           
                                           
                                             
                                             *Fig 9: LSTM layer for audio classification.*

                                               5. Pass the concatenated LSTM representation at each time step through a dense layer followed by softmax activation to produce the final prediction scores.

                                                 
                                                   
                                                     
                                                     *Fig 10: Output layer for speech recognition task.*
