 Multi-tasking refers to a person performing several tasks at once and usually involves switching between these tasks quickly or continuously over time. This can be difficult for people due to their cognitive abilities which requires focus on one task at a time during working hours. People who suffer from multi-tasking problems often have difficulties completing challenging tasks, such as those that involve long-term memory and attention span limitations. In this article, we will explore the concept of multitasking in depth through research on how it impacts cognition, motivation, perception, and behavior. 
          To better understand multitasking, let’s first examine its definition: 
          Multitasking: The ability of an individual to perform multiple tasks concurrently without distraction, while maintaining a clear mental picture of what each task entails. It involves two key components: switch-focus and coordination.
          
          Switch-Focus: A person's ability to easily shift between different tasks and maintain control over them. For example, if a person is completing tasks related to driving, they may need to switch to tasks related to reading or taking medication. They do not want to become distracted by other activities, so they must choose carefully which tasks to prioritize and stick to until completion. 
          
          Coordination: The process involved in aligning actions across various tasks to achieve greater efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction. There are many factors that contribute to successful coordination, including shared understanding, problem-solving skills, and teamwork skills. Successful coordination among individuals requires careful planning and communication, but also allows individuals to leverage their strengths and develop complementary skills. 
          While multitasking is known to be beneficial to human health, there has been limited empirical evidence regarding its effects on cognition, motivational, perceptual, and behavioral outcomes. However, recent studies suggest that multitasking can help improve productivity, creativity, critical thinking, and interpersonal relationships. Therefore, developing strategies for effective multitasking could lead to significant improvements in work performance and wellbeing.

          Within our exploratory analysis, we will discuss the following topics:
            - Cognitive processes associated with multitasking
            - How multitasking influences motivation and engagement
            - Neural mechanisms underlying multitasking
            - Strategies for achieving optimal multitasking performance

          Let's get started!
         # 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
          ## Task
          A task refers to any activity performed by an individual to complete a specific goal. Tasks include physical tasks like cooking, playing sports, and social interactions like eating together with friends. Each task typically occupies part of the brain's processing power and takes up valuable resources like time and attention spans. Different types of tasks require different levels of attention and proficiency. For example, complex mathematical calculations demand more attention than simple language exercises. 

          ## Working Memory (WM)
          The WM is responsible for short-term memory storage. It stores information relevant to the current context of execution, allowing the individual to retrieve memorized information quickly. The size of the WM varies depending on age, gender, level of education, etc. Research suggests that children tend to have larger WMs compared to adults and elders, although this remains a controversial topic. 

          ## Long-Term Memory (LM)
          LTM is responsible for storing longer-term memories, called semantic networks, which consist of patterns learned over time about objects, ideas, concepts, and events. These memories serve as a powerful way of organizing, recalling, and retrieving knowledge and insights. LTM plays a crucial role in multitasking because it enables individuals to transfer previously learned information across different tasks.  

          ## Focus
          Focus refers to a state where an individual is fully engaged in a single task and completely immersed in thought and feeling. Understanding the importance of focus, we can identify four key features of focused mindfulness: 

            - Immediate gratification: Focusing on a task immediately leads to immediate gratification, similar to getting a snack at a buffet after you finish your meal.  
            - Increased endurance: As with exercise, focusing regularly prevents injuries and improves overall quality of life.  
            - Maintain attention span: The length of time required to stay focused on a task determines the longevity of attention spans. If attention spans are too short, it becomes harder to pay attention to all aspects of the task.  
            - Deepened concentration: Continuous focus on a task ensures that the brain releases all impairments, making it easier to think clearly and remember the important details. 

          ## Multitasking vs. Parallelism
          Multitasking refers to a person performing several tasks simultaneously; parallelism refers to a situation where tasks execute independently, overlapping, or concurrently. Parallelization involves executing multiple independent tasks at the same time, whereas multitasking requires the use of visualizations, metaphors, simulations, or analogies to maintain focus on a single task. 

          In summary, multitasking involves multiple tasks executed sequentially within a certain period of time. On the other hand, parallelization involves the simultaneous execution of unrelated tasks using different media. 
         # 3. Core Algorithm and Psychological Principles
          One major benefit of multitasking is that it promotes increased productivity and increases flexibility in managing workload. Despite the benefits, however, multitasking poses unique challenges when it comes to controlling attention and ensuring cognitive balance. Additionally, even small adjustments to daily routines can drastically change the structure of personalities and impair task performance. According to Stevens, DeHoog, Goodman, & Sandler (SDGS), the core algorithm of multitasking relies on four psychological principles:

          1. Flow: The desire to remain in flow states throughout the day encourages us to focus on tasks with high ambiguity or complexity. By alternating between tasks, we learn new skills and experience emotions with less resistance.
          2. Interruption: When interrupted, we gain control back and allow ourselves to catch up on our missed tasks. We recover faster with feedback and reduce the negative consequences of interruptions.
          3. Autonomy: Multitasking promotes freedom and self-direction. We no longer feel pressured to complete all tasks before moving on, giving us space to reflect upon our progress.
          4. Socialization: Social interactions create groups of intelligent, competent individuals who share their experiences and expertise. Group dynamics encourage collaboration and interaction within a group.

          Overall, multitasking is widely considered a fundamental skill used by highly skilled workers around the world. Despite these benefits, there is still much room for improvement and development in terms of theory and techniques for improving multitasking performance. 
         # 4. Application and Implementation
          ## Problem Definition and Approach
          Our application scenario includes three tasks assigned to five individuals. Each person has a set of skills associated with each task. These skills vary in difficulty and duration of effort. The objective is to maximize the total performance of all individuals while minimizing interference caused by disruptive tasks. 

          Specifically, given the skills associated with each task, we would like to find ways to allocate tasks efficiently and effectively while ensuring that each individual performs his/her best. To start with, we will consider different allocation algorithms, such as Eisenhower matrix and Hirschberg's method. Based on the outcome of these algorithms, we will then come up with optimized scheduling strategies to minimize task interference. Finally, we will analyze the results obtained and design experiments to validate our findings.
