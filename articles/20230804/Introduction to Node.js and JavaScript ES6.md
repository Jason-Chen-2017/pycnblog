# 1.简介
         
Node.js 是一种基于 Chrome V8 引擎的 JavaScript 运行环境。JavaScript 的异步编程模型天生具备并发特性，这使得它非常适合用于编写高性能的服务器端应用。而 Node.js 在 JavaScript 语言基础之上提供了更高级的工具，例如包管理器 npm、模块化系统 CommonJS、事件驱动 I/O 模型等。本教程将会带领读者了解这些重要概念及其特性，并帮助读者快速上手开发基于 Node.js 的 Web 应用。
# 2. 基本概念术语
## 2.1 计算机网络
计算机网络是一个计算机 communicating with another computer over a shared medium (usually wires) and is made up of nodes that communicate through various hardware protocols such as ethernet or WiFi. Nodes are connected by routers that forward data between them based on predetermined routes. The primary purpose of the network is to enable communication between computers for different applications such as web browsing, email transmission, file sharing, gaming, etc.


## 2.2 HTTP协议
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML, images, videos, and text across the internet. It is the foundation of World Wide Web and all modern web browsers use it to request content from servers. When using a browser to access a website, you interact with HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., which instruct the server what action to take on specific resources or objects in the database. Additionally, some responses returned by the server include headers like Content-Type, Content-Length, Server, Date, ETag, Expires, Cache-Control, Connection, etc. These header fields provide additional information about the response payload, including its type, length, origin server details, date generated, cache expiration time, connection management directives, etc. HTTP also supports secure connections via HTTPS, which encrypts data sent across the network so that other systems cannot sniff or intercept sensitive information. Overall, the core concepts of HTTP include:

1. Request: An HTTP request consists of three main parts:
   - Method: This specifies the operation being performed on the resource, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
   - URL: This specifies the location of the resource being requested, such as http://www.example.com/index.html.
   - Headers: Additional information included in the request, typically including user agent string, accept types, language preferences, caching directives, authentication credentials, etc.
   
2. Response: An HTTP response contains two main parts:
   - Status code: A numeric code indicating whether the request was successful, unauthorized, forbidden, not found, internal server error, etc.
   - Headers: Similar to the request headers, these specify additional information about the response payload, including its type, length, encoding, age, location, timing information, validation status, etc.
   - Body: Contains the actual data being transmitted, usually in JSON or HTML format depending on the requested resource.

## 2.3 JavaScript
JavaScript (JS) is a dynamic programming language initially designed as a client-side scripting language for web pages but now running on the server side as well. Originally created by Netscape Communications Corporation, it has become popular due to its lightweight and versatility. Its primary purpose is to allow developers to create interactive and animated web pages without requiring page refreshes. It uses object-oriented programming and prototypal inheritance to support both functional and imperative programming styles. JS can be embedded within HTML tags to add interactivity to static web pages, making it easy to integrate complex functionality into existing web applications. Some key features of JS include:

1. Types: JS has a dynamically typed system where variables do not need explicit declaration of their type. Instead, they are inferred based on their value at runtime. The built-in typeof operator returns the type of a given variable, while the instanceof operator allows us to check if an object belongs to a certain class or subclass.

2. Execution model: JS uses a single threaded event loop architecture, meaning that only one thread runs at any given time. In order to handle concurrency, JS provides callback functions, promises, async/await keywords, and web workers. Callback functions are passed as arguments to asynchronous functions and execute after the function completes its execution. Promises represent the result of an asynchronous operation that may either succeed or fail. Async/await enables us to write cleaner, more readable code by combining promise chains together. Web workers run separate threads allowing us to perform heavy operations in the background without blocking the UI thread. 

3. Modules and packages: While JS does not have a standardized module system like Python or Ruby, several popular tools like Browserify, Webpack, RequireJS, and SystemJS offer support for modularizing code and managing dependencies. Packages are groups of related modules that share common properties, such as naming conventions, APIs, documentation, tests, build scripts, etc. They are commonly published to public registries like npm, GitHub, or private repositories.

# 3. Core Algorithmic Principles and Implementation Steps
In this section, we will go through basic algorithmic principles and implementation steps to get started with development using Node.js. We will start with understanding how Node.js handles I/O events, then move onto working with streams and buffers, file system manipulation, process creation and handling child processes, and finally exploring asynchronous programming techniques. 

We assume readers already know basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, variables, arrays, and functions. If not, please refer back to previous tutorials or books before continuing. Also note that some examples below might require external libraries or plugins, hence the reader should have installed them correctly to run them properly.

### Event Driven Architecture
Node.js follows an event driven architecture design paradigm, in which the program waits for input/events from the operating system and responds accordingly by executing a callback function. Events are things that happen outside of our control, such as timers firing, keyboard presses, incoming HTTP requests, etc. When an event occurs, Node.js fires a corresponding event handler, which executes your provided code block. Here's a simple example to illustrate the concept:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs'); // require the 'fs' library to work with files

// Define a callback function
function readFileCallback(err, data) {
  console.log(`Data received: ${data}`);
}

// Watch for changes to a file
fs.watch('./file.txt', {}, readFileCallback);

console.log('Waiting for changes...');
```
The above example watches for changes to a file named `file.txt` everytime the file is modified, reads the contents of the file, prints them out to the console, and exits gracefully when done. In essence, Node.js listens for events and responds accordingly using callbacks. There are many other useful methods available for dealing with filesystem, networking, and other low level tasks, such as `setTimeout()`, `setInterval()`, `http`, `https`, etc.
