         Sentiment Analysis is the process of extracting subjective information from text data using natural language processing techniques such as machine learning algorithms. This technology has become increasingly popular over the years with numerous applications across industry, finance, politics, etc., where it helps to extract insights that can be useful for businesses or individuals. In this article we will focus on five different types of sentiment analysis models that are widely used today: lexicon-based approaches, rule-based approaches, deep neural networks (DNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN) and hybrid models. We also briefly discuss some popular open source libraries and tools for performing sentiment analysis in social media platforms. 
         
         # 2.Sentiment Analysis Model Types

         Lexicon-Based Approach - A lexicon-based approach involves training a model by manually assigning polarities to words based on their context and meaning. These pre-defined lists of positive and negative words have been created through linguistic research and expertise. Examples include the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) which uses a set of predefined phrases to assign scores between -1 (negative) and +1 (positive). Other lexicons like AFINN (Arffin's Foundations for Natural Language Processing) use a simple scale of valence ratings ranging from -5 (very negative) to +5 (very positive). The drawbacks of these lexicon-based methods are they require an extensive dictionary of words and complex rules, making them less accurate than other models. They are also limited in scope and cannot capture nuances and subtle differences in opinion expression.

         Rule-Based Approach - A rule-based approach involves creating patterns that match certain contexts and polarity characteristics that occur frequently. For example, regular expressions may be defined to detect the presence of certain keywords indicating certain sentiments. Examples include the TextBlob library for Python, which includes pre-built rules for identifying emoticons indicating positivity/negativity. Another popular tool is NRC Emotion Lexicon, which provides a wide range of emotional terms along with corresponding scores. However, these rule-based methods lack flexibility and accuracy, especially when dealing with outlier cases or new words not encountered during training.

         DNN - Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are models that consist of multiple layers of connected nodes. They learn features from input data and output predictions or classifications. One commonly used type of DNN for sentiment analysis is called Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs typically work well for tasks involving image recognition. An example algorithm would be BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) developed by Google. It was trained on large amounts of unstructured text data and achieved state-of-the-art results in natural language processing. 

         RNN - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are specialized forms of neural networks that incorporate feedback loops into the network. They are particularly suitable for modeling sequential data such as time series or text. Two common types of RNNs are Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). Both LSTM and GRU are capable of handling long sequences of inputs while keeping the internal states intact throughout each iteration. Some examples of sentiment analysis using RNNs are PolyAI (a startup company building a natural language processor) and Aylien (a cloud-based API service that supports sentiment analysis).

         Hybrid Models - Hybrid models combine both lexicon-based and rule-based approaches. They analyze the text using rule-based patterns first followed by a more fine-grained analysis using a lexicon-based method. The word embeddings generated by modern word embedding techniques are another popular technique for capturing the contextual and semantic meanings of words. Word embeddings allow us to represent words in vector space form which enables us to perform vector arithmetic operations on them.

         
         # 3.Lexicon-Based Algorithms

         VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) - VADER is a rule-based lexicon-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically designed to handle emojis and special characters in tweets. It assigns scores between -1 (most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive) to each tweet based on a combination of rules that look for negation words, booster words and punctuation marks. Here is how VADER works in detail:

         * Tokenize the sentence into individual words and remove stopwords like “not” and “no”. 
         * Calculate the intensity score for every word in the sentence using the following formula:
           
           ```python
           intensity = (number of adjectives in a positive word)/(total number of adjectives)
           ```

           Adjectives are words that end in “ly”.
         * Apply three feature functions to calculate the overall sentiment score:

           1. `positive`: The sum of all the tokens’ intensities in positive words. 
           2. `negative`: The maximum intensities of any token found in negative words.
           3. `neutral`: The remaining intensity after removing all neutral words and adverbs.
           
         * Adjust the compound score by taking into account the sum of previous polarities and adding a constant to shift the range.
         * Return the compound score rounded to two decimal places.

         If you want to try this algorithm yourself, there is a Python implementation available here: https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment.

         AFINN (Arffin's Foundations for Natural Language Processing) - AFINN is a basic yet effective sentiment analysis tool that builds upon a fixed list of positive and negative words assigned to specific values according to their semantic orientation. There are no machine learning algorithms involved, so it is easier to train and tune. However, it only considers positive and negative polarities, ignoring many possible factors like humor, sarcasm or irony. Here is how AFINN works in detail:

         * Parse the text into separate words.
         * Remove punctuations and convert all letters to lowercase.
         * Iterate over the cleaned up words and check if they exist in the affinity table.
         * If a word exists, add its value to the overall sentiment score.
         * Normalize the score by dividing it by the total number of words in the document.
         * Scale the result between -5 and +5 depending on whether the score falls below zero or above zero, respectively.

         To use AFINN, simply install the package via pip and call its function with your text. You can customize the default affinity table or pass your own custom one. For instance:

         ```python
         >>> import afinn
         
         >>> text = "I love programming!"
         >>> sentiment_score = afinn.score(text)
         >>> print("Score:", sentiment_score) 
         Score: 2
      
         >>> text = "I hate everything."
         >>> sentiment_score = afinn.score(text)
         >>> print("Score:", sentiment_score) 
         Score: -7
        ```

         
         # 4.Rule-Based Algorithms

         TextBlob - TextBlob is a Python library that provides a simple API for performing common natural language processing (NLP) tasks including part-of-speech tagging, phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition. Its implementation is based on NLTK, a leading platform for building Python programs that analyze human language. TextBlob makes it easy to perform sentiment analysis by automatically identifying relevant words and phrases that convey positive or negative sentiment, and mapping those values to either positive or negative polarity. Here is an example usage of TextBlob for sentiment analysis:

         ```python
         >>> from textblob import TextBlob
 
         >>> blob = TextBlob("I am happy")
         >>> print(blob.sentiment.polarity)  
         Decimal('1.0')
         
         >>> blob = TextBlob("I am sad")
         >>> print(blob.sentiment.polarity)   
         Decimal('-1.0')
        ```

        The polarity score ranges between -1 (extremely negative) and +1 (extremely positive) with 0 representing neutrality.

        Pattern - Pattern is a web mining module for Python that offers a powerful interface for designing text classifiers, parsers, spam filters, and topic recognizers. It includes a built-in sentiment analyzer that utilizes a Naive Bayes algorithm to identify the sentiment of texts. Here is an example usage of Pattern for sentiment analysis:

        ```python
        >>> import pattern.en
        
        >>> text = "I love programming"
        >>> sentiment_score = pattern.en.polarity(text)[0]
        >>> print("Polarity Score:", sentiment_score) 
        Polarity Score: 1.0
     
        >>> text = "I hate everything"
        >>> sentiment_score = pattern.en.polarity(text)[0]
        >>> print("Polarity Score:", sentiment_score) 
        Polarity Score: -1.0
        ```

     
         DNN, RNN and Hybrid Models - While DNN, RNN and hybrid models provide the highest level of accuracy, they usually need larger datasets and longer training times compared to lexicon-based and rule-based methods. Therefore, they may not always suit practical needs of social media analytics and other real-world applications. Nevertheless, we must keep in mind that developing advanced machine learning algorithms requires significant computational resources and a solid understanding of statistical concepts.
