# 1.简介
         
WebAssembly (Wasm) is a new binary instruction format for web browsers and the server that enables near-native performance by taking advantage of existing hardware like GPUs or multicore CPUs. It's an open standard supported by all major browser vendors with support expected to be added in upcoming releases. Wasm provides several benefits over traditional JavaScript runtimes such as faster execution times, smaller file sizes, lower memory usage, increased security, and more flexibility when it comes to executing code across multiple platforms. In this article, we'll explore how to use Web Assembly within Node.js projects from scratch to speed improvements using common algorithms and techniques. We will also cover some best practices for writing performant Wasm modules and see how they can improve application performance beyond just running them on Node.js. 

# 2.基本概念术语说明
Web Assembly, commonly known as Wasm, is a low-level assembly language designed for efficient execution on the web platform. Its design principles are based around a small set of core instructions built on top of a stack-based machine architecture. These instructions include basic arithmetic operations, control flow operations, and data access operations. Unlike most other programming languages, Wasm has no explicit memory allocation or garbage collection mechanisms, which means that developers need to carefully manage memory allocations and deallocation to avoid crashes or errors. The aim of Web Assembly is to enable compilers to output highly optimized code suitable for running natively on modern web browsers while still being portable across different environments.

Node.js uses V8 as its JavaScript engine, which supports both ECMAScript and Web Assembly. This allows us to run Wasm modules directly within Node.js without needing additional tools or libraries. When compiling C/C++ code into Wasm modules, there are two main approaches - either through an external compiler tool chain or through integrated build systems like Emscripten. Building Wasm modules requires knowledge of several technologies including LLVM, C++, Assembly, and Rust.

In this article, we will demonstrate how to create and optimize simple Wasm modules and then apply these concepts to improve the performance of Node.js applications. Let's get started!

## Memory Management
Memory management is one of the critical components of any programming language and especially relevant to memory-intensive tasks like image processing, audio manipulation, or scientific computing. In Web Assembly, we have direct access to memory via linear memory objects, which are represented using raw byte arrays. To manipulate memory efficiently, we must keep track of our position within the array so that we know where to read and write data. Additionally, Web Assembly does not support dynamic memory allocation or garbage collection, which means that we should allocate enough memory upfront and recycle it only when necessary.

We can start by creating a simple Web Assembly module using the text representation and importing the necessary library functions. Here's an example of a "hello world" program written in C++ that exports a single function called "sayHello":

```cpp
#include <iostream>

extern "C" {
  void sayHello() {
    std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;
  }
}
```

To compile this module into Web Assembly format, we can use the emcc command line tool provided by Emscripten. Assuming we've already installed Emscripten and added the path to our system PATH environment variable, we can compile the hello.cpp source file as follows:

```bash
emcc hello.cpp -o hello.wasm --llvm-lto=thin
```

This generates a wasm file named hello.wasm that contains the compiled Web Assembly module alongside its supporting files. Once we load this file into Node.js, we can call the exported "sayHello" function using the require function. Here's an example script:

```javascript
const hello = require('./hello');

hello.sayHello(); // Output: "Hello, world!"
```

Now let's try optimizing the above program using SIMD instructions. One way to do this is to replace loops with vectorized versions using intrinsics available in newer compilers. Here's an updated version of the same code that includes SIMD intrinsics:

```cpp
#include <immintrin.h>
#include <iostream>
#define VECTOR_SIZE 4

extern "C" {

  __m256i add(__m256i x, __m256i y) {
    return _mm256_add_epi32(x, y);
  }

  void sayHelloVectorized() {

    const int *data = nullptr;
    int sum = 0;

    // Simd loop
    __m256i vecSum = _mm256_setzero_si256();
    for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(data)/sizeof(*data); ++i) {
      auto value = _mm256_loadu_si256((__m256i*)(&data[i]));
      vecSum = add(vecSum, value);
    }
    auto result = _mm256_extract_epi32(vecSum, 0);

    std::cout << "Hello, world! Sum is " << result << "." << std::endl;
  }
}
```

To compile this code into Web Assembly format, we can simply modify the compilation step slightly by adding the "-msimd128" option to target AVX2 instructions:

```bash
emcc hello.cpp -o hello.wasm --llvm-lto=thin -msimd128
```

With this change, the generated.wasm file now includes SIMD optimizations, making it significantly faster than the original version. Now let's compare the performance of these two programs under various conditions:

1. Without optimization
2. With SIMD optimization but without multi-threading
3. With SIMD optimization and multi-threading enabled

We can achieve each of these scenarios by modifying the Node.js script that loads the.wasm file differently. For scenario #1, we don't make any changes to the Node.js script and leave it unchanged. Scenario #2 involves enabling worker threads using the Worker class and sharing a buffer between them. Scenario #3 involves spawning child processes to distribute the workload among multiple cores.

Here's an example benchmarking script that measures the time taken to execute the sayHello and sayHelloVectorized functions:

```javascript
function measureExecutionTime(fn) {
  console.time(fn.name || 'executionTime')
  fn();
  console.timeEnd(fn.name || 'executionTime')
}

// Test without optimization
require('../path/to/hello').sayHello();

measureExecutionTime(() => {
  // Test with SIMD optimization but without multi-threading
  require('../path/to/hello').sayHelloVectorized();
});

if (typeof Worker!== 'undefined') {
  // Create a shared buffer for multi-threaded testing
  const buffer = new SharedArrayBuffer(1024);
  
  // Spawn a worker process for multi-threaded testing
  const worker = new Worker('worker.js', { type:'module' });
  
  // Send the buffer reference to the worker process
  worker.postMessage({ buffer }, [buffer]);
  
  measureExecutionTime(() => {
    // Wait for the message response from the worker process
    worker.onmessage = () => {
      // Execute the vectorized code inside the worker process
      worker.postMessage([buffer], [buffer])
    };
  })
} else if (typeof fork === 'function') {
  // Spawn a child process for multi-core testing
  const cp = fork(`${__dirname}/childProcess.js`);
  
  // Pass the forked process the name of the module to test
  cp.send('../path/to/hello');
  
  measureExecutionTime(() => {
    // Listen for messages from the child process
    cp.once('message', () => {
      // Execute the vectorized code inside the child process
      cp.send(['../path/to/hello']);
    });
  });
}

console.log("Done!");
```

Finally, here are some key takeaways from this experiment:

- Vectorization is a powerful technique for improving computation efficiency on modern processors.
- By leveraging the latest capabilities of modern compilers, we can easily generate high-performance code even for simple numerical computations.
- Optimizing Wasm modules further can unlock even higher levels of performance by exploiting the full power of modern CPU architectures.
