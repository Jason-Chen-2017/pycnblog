# 1.简介
         
 Attention mechanism (AM) has been introduced to address the problem of memory and addressing in neural networks recently. AM is widely used in various deep learning applications such as machine translation, image captioning, speech recognition and dialog systems. In this paper, we aim at providing a comprehensive review of recent advances made by different researchers in the field of natural language processing using attention mechanisms. We present an overview of the key ideas in AM along with a brief explanation of their application in NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, question answering, etc. We also highlight several drawbacks faced by AM in practical settings and provide directions for future work. 
          To understand the working principles behind AM, let us first understand its basic concept of attention-based models.
         # 2.Attention Mechanism Basic Concepts & Terminology
         ## 2.1.Introduction
         Attention mechanism refers to a specific type of recurrent neural network architecture that allows a decoder or any other network module to focus on different parts of input data or output sequence based on some selection criteria such as similarity between inputs or outputs. It enables the model to selectively pay more attention to relevant information from the given inputs/outputs rather than blindly following a fixed path. The key idea behind attention mechanisms lies in integrating global and local contextual information into the decision making process.
         Within this section, we will explain the major concepts related to attention mechanisms which are essential in understanding the working principle of attention mechanisms.

         ### 2.1.1 Basics of Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs)
         RNNs have been extensively studied since they were proposed by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber. An RNN takes sequential input sequences of length T and produces a single output vector of dimension D at each time step t. At each time step, the RNN receives a vector x[t] representing the current input at that timestep, generates a hidden state h[t], and updates its internal state s[t]. The internal state s[t] captures the temporal dependencies within the input sequence and helps the RNN to learn complex patterns over long periods of time. There are three main variants of RNN architectures: vanilla RNN, LSTM, and GRU, each with unique characteristics. Vanilla RNN, for example, applies a simple linear transformation Wx+b to the input vector at each time step followed by a non-linear activation function, such as sigmoid or tanh. 
         The purpose of RNN is to capture the temporal relationships among individual elements in the input sequence and use them to predict the next element in the sequence. However, capturing all the dependencies can lead to the vanishing gradient issue where gradients become very small and stop updating the weights effectively causing the model to perform poorly even after training it for a large number of iterations. This leads to a need to introduce a technique called “gating” to mitigate the effect of vanishing gradients. Gated RNNs, like LSTMs and GRUs, add additional gates that control the flow of information through the cells and help maintain the dynamic state of the network during training. 

         ### 2.1.2 Sequence to Sequence Models
         One of the most common types of neural network architectures used in natural language processing is the sequence to sequence (seq2seq) model. These models are commonly used for tasks such as machine translation, automatic summarization, and dialogue systems. Seq2seq models typically consist of two separate components - encoder and decoder. The encoder component takes the input sequence X and processes it to produce a fixed size representation z, while the decoder component uses the encoded representation z to generate the target sequence Y. During decoding, the decoder generates one word per time step until the end of the sequence or until a special token indicating the end of generation is encountered.
         Here’s how seq2seq models operate under the hood:

         1. Input sentence X -> Encoding stage
            * Embedding layer : Converts the input words to vectors
            * Encoder RNN layers : Processes the embedded input vector sequentially to produce a fixed sized vector z
          
         2. Fixed size representation z -> Decoding Stage
             * Decoder embedding layer : Maps the fixed size representation z back to the original space of words
             * Decoder RNN layers : Generates predicted word tokens yi, one word at a time, starting with start symbol
             * Output layer : Outputs probability distribution p(yi|z)

         ### 2.1.3 Multi-Head Attention Mechanisms
         Attention mechanisms have been shown to improve the performance of many deep learning models. Various approaches have been proposed to design attention mechanisms including dot product attention, scaled dot-product attention, multihead attention, and convolutional attention. We will cover only the multihead attention mechanism here because it provides significant improvements over standard attention mechanisms. Multihead attention involves splitting the query, keys, and values into multiple heads and computing attention across each head independently before combining the results. Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the operation of multihead attention mechanism.

         Consider a batch of input sequences X = {x^1, x^2,..., x^m} and corresponding output sequences Y = {y^1, y^2,..., y^m}. Each input sequence xi ∈ X is represented as a matrix of shape [TxD], where Tx is the maximum length of the sequence, D is the dimensionality of the features. The output sequences are generated one at a time in parallel for efficiency reasons. Given the current input sequence xi and previous output yi_prev, the goal is to generate the next output token yi. So, given the last output token, we need to find the right position to insert it into the input sequence xi so that the prediction error becomes minimized. The expected prediction error E(xi, yi) can be calculated as follows:

                 E(xi, yi) = Σ[-log(p(yi|xi))]

          Where Σ represents the sum of errors for all i positions in the input sequence.

          Let's assume there are k heads in our multihead attention mechanism, then we can define four matrices Q_k, K_k, V_k, and O_k for each head k. The dimensions of these matrices depend on the chosen hyperparameters and can be defined as follows:

                  Q_k : [LxTqxD]/[NxD]/[NxLxDq]
                  K_k : [LyTzxD]/[NxD]/[NyLzxDz]
                  V_k : [LyTzxD]/[NxD]/[NyLzxDz]
                  O_k : [WxWy]/[NxWxWy]

           Here, q, d, v, w, and l represent the number of queries, dimensions of feature embeddings, number of values, output projection weight dimensions, and lengths respectively.
           Now, we calculate the attention scores according to the following formula:

                      S = softmax((QK^T)/√d)
                      M = SV

           First, we compute the affinity matrix QK^T by taking the dot product of queries Q and keys K and applying the scaling factor √d to prevent the dot products from growing too large. Then, we apply the softmax function to convert the resulting affinity matrix into normalized weights S. Finally, we multiply the normalized weights with the value vectors V to obtain the weighted average representations M.

           Next, we concatenate the weighted average representations obtained from each head and pass them through another fully connected layer with the same dimensions as the input dimensions. The resultant tensor can be referred to as the combined output Oi. All outputs Oi are concatenated together to form the final output sequence yi.

      # 3. Advanced Applications of Attention Mechanisms
      After introducing the basics of attention mechanisms, we can now discuss several advanced applications of attention mechanisms in NLP tasks. Specifically, we will talk about few techniques such as pointer networks, self-attention generative adversarial networks, and transformer-based models. We will try to motivate the usage of these techniques by highlighting their benefits compared to conventional approaches. Also, we will explore how these techniques combine with traditional RNN-based models to achieve higher accuracy in certain tasks.
      
      # Pointer Networks
      Pointer networks are a class of conditional auto-regressive models that enable models to extract relevant parts of input sequences without explicitly modeling the entire sequence dependency structure. Pointer networks have been proved useful in natural language processing due to their ability to handle variable-length input sequences and preserve semantic meaning of the text. The intuition behind pointer networks is to assign probabilities to each location in the input sequence and infer the exact position where the next token should be inserted. The positional encoding encodes relative distances between the tokens, allowing the model to focus on the relevant parts of the sequence. Pointer networks are often used in conjunction with RNN-based models and transformers.
      
     Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) is a powerful approach to train highly realistic images using unsupervised methods. The key idea behind SAGAN is to train a generator network G to produce synthetic images that look similar to the real images but do not contain explicit labels. Instead of training a discriminator network directly on pairs of real and fake images, SAGAN trains two separate networks simultaneously – a generator G and a discriminator D – using mutually reinforced adversarial training. The discriminator D learns to classify real and fake images accurately using a cross-entropy loss, while the generator G aims to fool the discriminator by producing images that look real but are actually produced by the generator. As a result, both the generator and discriminator networks converge towards equilibrium, generating images that are indistinguishable from real ones. 
    
     The transformer-based model is a breakthrough in modern NLP by achieving state-of-the-art performance in numerous tasks such as machine translation, named entity recognition, and question answering. Transformer models replace the recurrence in RNN-based models with the attention mechanism enabling simultaneous processing of all source and target sentences in the training phase. Transforms reduce the computational complexity of parallelization and make it feasible to train large models on high-performance machines. Transformers are widely used in industry and academia, including Google, Facebook, Salesforce, and Uber.
