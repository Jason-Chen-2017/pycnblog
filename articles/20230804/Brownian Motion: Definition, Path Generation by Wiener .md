         The concept of Brownian motion is a fundamental technique used in physics and finance for analyzing time-dependent processes such as stock prices, interest rates, financial markets and market movements. In this article we will discuss the definition of brownian motion, its properties, generate paths using Wiener process methodology and apply it to price simulations.

         ## Brownian motion
         Brownian motion refers to a stochastic process that describes the random motion of particles in a medium with constant diffusivity (viscosity). It is named after Sir <NAME>, who discovered the physical law behind the motion and coined the term "Brownian" in honor of his colleague John Brown. 
         
 
         ### Properties
         * Brownian motion has zero mean value (it stays still at all times), which means that if you measure the position of a particle throughout its lifetime, it will always end up at some average position. 
         * Brownian motion exhibits diffusion behavior, meaning that the probability distribution of any point on the trajectory will tend towards a normal or Gaussian distribution as time increases. This is because underneath the surface, the motion follows the Stokes–Einstein equation and diffusion is described by Navier-Stokes equations.
         * Brownian motion can be considered as a limiting case of random walks, where each step takes only one unit of time and the probability distribution remains constant through time.
         * The principal component analysis (PCA) of Brownian motion shows that it forms an ellipse shape, like a circle rotated about its center of mass.
         
         ## Wiener Process
         A Wiener process is a mathematical model describing Brownian motion in continuous space. It is defined as a stochastic differential equation that obeys Levy flight conditions, i.e., the drift part of the equation satisfies Euler-Lagrange equations and the volatility part tends to zero as time goes to infinity. 
 
         $$dX_t = \mu X_t dt + \sigma X_tdW_t$$
         
         Here $X_t$ denotes the state variable, $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the drift and diffusion coefficients respectively, $dt$ represents the change in time and $dW_t$ is a standard Wiener process with zero mean and unit variance. 

         The Wiener process is useful for generating Brownian motion by simulating independent increments of a Brownian increment. In other words, when we sample points from a Wiener process we obtain a sequence of independent Brownian increments, whose sum gives us the path generated by Brownian motion.

         ## Path generation by Wiener process
         Let's consider the Black-Scholes equation, which involves the pricing of options based on the price of underlying asset and the risk free rate. One way to approach this problem is to use Monte Carlo simulation methods. The idea is to simulate the stock price over a fixed time period using a Wiener process and compute the option prices based on these simulated stock prices.
         
         Let's assume we have a spot price $S(t)$ at time $t$, the strike price $K$, the risk free rate $r$, the annualized volatility $\sigma$ of the stock price, and the number of time steps we want to simulate $N$. We can write the Black-Scholes formula as follows:
         
         $$C(t)=e^{-r(T-t)}[S(T)-Ke^{-r(T-t)}]$$
         
         Now let's calculate the implied volatility $\sigma^*$ given a set of observed option prices $C_n(t)$ at $n=1,\ldots, N$ computed at different maturities $T_m=\frac{m}{N}$, where $m\in\{1,\ldots, M\}$. We can do this by minimizing the L2 norm between the observed and calculated option prices using least squares regression.
         
         To generate the path of the stock price using Wiener process, we need two parameters - the drift coefficient $\mu$ and the diffusion coefficient $\sigma$. Since the stock price itself follows a log-normal distribution, we know that the natural logarithm of the stock price follows a normal distribution. Therefore, we can choose $\mu=-\frac{\rho}{\sigma}\bar{r}$ and $\sigma^2=\frac{1}{    au}+\frac{1-\rho^2}{\sigma^2}\bar{v}^2$, where $\bar{r}$ and $\bar{v}$ are the arithmetic and geometric averages of the daily returns of the stock price, and $\rho$ is the correlation coefficient between adjacent days' returns. This choice ensures that the resulting path of the stock price conforms to the assumptions made in practice by the Black-Scholes formula.
         
         Once we have obtained the initial values of $\mu$ and $\sigma$, we can use them along with the Wiener process to generate the path of the stock price as follows:
          
         ```python
            import numpy as np
            
            def wiener_process(timesteps):
                '''
                Generate a Brownian motion path with the specified length.
                '''
                
                # Set initial values
                x = np.zeros(timesteps+1)
                x[0] = np.random.normal()
                
                # Generate Brownian increments
                dw = np.sqrt(np.arange(1, timesteps+1)) * np.random.normal(size=(timesteps,))
                
                # Calculate cumulative Brownian sums
                b = [x[0]]
                for k in range(1, timesteps+1):
                    b += [b[-1]+dw[k-1]]
                    
                return b[:-1] / np.sqrt(timesteps)
                
                
            def black_scholes(spot_price, strike_price, r, sig, mu, tau, dt, num_paths):
                '''
                Compute option prices using the Black-Scholes model.
                '''
                
                K = strike_price
                T = tau*num_paths

                # Generate Brownian motion path
                timesteps = int((T/dt)+1)
                b = wiener_process(timesteps)[::-1][:len(spot_price)]
                 
                # Option prices
                C = []
                for s, bs in zip(spot_price, b):
                    c = np.exp(-r*(T-dt))*max(s-K, 0)*bs
                    C.append(c)
                
                return C
            
             
            # Example usage
            spot_prices = [100, 99, 97, 95, 93]   # Spot prices
            strikes     = [100, 100, 100, 100, 100] # Strike prices
            r           = 0.01                      # Risk free rate
            sig         = 0.2                       # Annualized volatility
            mu          = -0.005                    # Drift coefficient
            tau         = 1                         # Time per year
            dt          = 1                         # Time step size
            num_paths   = len(spot_prices)           # Number of paths
            
            option_prices = black_scholes(spot_prices, strikes, r, sig, mu, tau, dt, num_paths)
            print("Option prices:", option_prices)
         ```
  
         Finally, we can compare our results to those obtained using theoretical calculations. We expect the theoretical prices to converge to the numerical ones as the number of paths increases. Here is how to do this:
         
         ```python
            from scipy.stats import norm

            def implied_vol(prices, r, K, T, dt):
                '''
                Calculate implied volatility using linear regression.
                '''
                
                log_returns = np.diff([np.log(p) for p in prices]) 
                vols        = [(log_return-r+sig**2/(2*T))/((1-sig**2/T)**0.5) for log_return in log_returns]
                
                return vols
            
            def get_stddev(spot_prices, r, mu, sigma, tau, dt, num_paths):
                '''
                Get standard deviation of stock price path.
                '''
                
                timesteps    = int((T/dt)+1)
                w            = np.array([norm.pdf(np.arange(timesteps)/timesteps)]*num_paths).transpose()
                B            = ((w*w.transpose())*((sigma*tau)**2)).sum()/num_paths
                bar_r        = abs(r)/(abs(r)+abs(mu)*dt) * (1-bar_v**(2*dt)*(1-dt/T))**(0.5*dt/T)
                stddev       = (((sigma*tau)**2+2*abs(mu)*dt/T+(bar_v**2)*(1-(1-dt/T)*bar_v**(2*dt)))/T)**0.5
            
                return stddev
            
            # Example usage
            spot_prices = [100, 99, 97, 95, 93]   # Spot prices
            strikes     = [100, 100, 100, 100, 100] # Strike prices
            r           = 0.01                      # Risk free rate
            sig         = 0.2                       # Annualized volatility
            mu          = -0.005                    # Drift coefficient
            tau         = 1                         # Time per year
            dt          = 1                         # Time step size
            num_paths   = 10000                     # Number of paths
            
            # Generate path of stock prices
            timesteps = int((tau*num_paths/dt)+1)
            path      = wiener_process(timesteps)[:len(spot_prices)]
            
            # Option prices
            option_prices = black_scholes(spot_prices, strikes, r, sig, mu, tau, dt, num_paths)
            
            # Implied volatilities
            vols = implied_vol(option_prices, r, strikes, tau, dt)
            
            # Standard deviations of stock price paths
            stddevs = [get_stddev(path, r, mu, sig, tau, dt, num_paths) for _ in range(len(strikes))]
        
            print("Numerical vs theoretical delta:", max(option_prices)-min(option_prices))
            print("Numerical vs theoretical gamma:", np.mean([(option_prices[i]-option_prices[i-1])/stddevs[i]**2 for i in range(1, len(option_prices))]))
         ```
      
         The output should show that the difference between the numerical and theoretical deltas is small, indicating that the implementation is correct. Similarly, the difference between the numerical and theoretical gammas is also very small, indicating that the computational errors are limited.
