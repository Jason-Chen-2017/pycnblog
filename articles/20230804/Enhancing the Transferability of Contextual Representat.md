Text classification is a fundamental task in natural language processing that assigns text to one or more predefined categories based on its content and structure. The process can be automated by using various machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, these models require large amounts of labeled data, which is often expensive and time-consuming to obtain. In this paper, we present an approach called self-training for contextual representation enhancement that leverages unlabeled data to improve transferability of learned representations. We develop a new self-training algorithm, with three main steps: 1) pretraining phase, where deep neural networks are trained on labeled data alone; 2) fine-tuning phase, where a small amount of additional unlabeled data is used to further train the network; and 3) self-training phase, where the outputs of both phases are combined and fine-tuned again. The resulting model has higher accuracy than either shallowly or finely tuned baselines, while reducing the need for costly manual labeling effort and allowing for faster application development. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across several datasets, including two popular text classification benchmarks - IMDB movie reviews dataset and Amazon review polarity dataset.

Contextual representation refers to the information captured within a sentence that is useful for determining its category. It captures the meaning of individual words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs or documents without relying on any explicit linguistic cues. Common examples include bag-of-words models, word embeddings like GloVe, and language models like BERT. Each type of representation possesses unique characteristics that make them suitable for different types of tasks. For example, sentiment analysis requires capturing not only the presence/absence of positive or negative words but also their relative importance within the sentence. On the other hand, named entity recognition involves identifying specific entities mentioned in the document along with their corresponding labels. Both of these applications rely heavily on contextual representations due to the varying degrees of semantic similarity between words. To enhance the performance of these models, we propose a novel method called Self-training for Contextual Representation Enhancement (STRCE), which combines labeled data from multiple domains with unlabeled data from a target domain to effectively learn generalizable contextual features that are relevant to all domains. This article describes the STRCE technique and demonstrates its effectiveness over four popular NLP datasets.

We assume that the reader is familiar with supervised learning and its related concepts such as training set, validation set, test set, loss function, optimization algorithm etc. Additionally, the reader should have basic understanding of deep learning architectures and their terminologies such as hidden layers, activation functions, pooling operations, regularization methods, dropout rates etc. Furthermore, the reader must be aware of unsupervised learning and its challenges such as curse of dimensionality, local vs global structure, noise level, and outliers. Finally, the reader must be comfortable working with Python programming language and libraries such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib etc.
In brief, the problem at stake here is to design and implement an effective approach for enhancing the transferability of contextual representations obtained from deep neural networks during the training process. Specifically, given a set of labeled and unlabeled data, we aim to learn robust and informative contextual features for each class, even when there is limited or no labeled data available for that particular class. There are two primary components involved in this problem: Pre-training phase and Self-training phase. The former is responsible for training the base deep neural network using only the labeled data. While, the latter combines the output of both pre-trained and partially labeled data into a final model for improved performance. Here, we will provide an overview of the pre-training and self-training phases followed by a detailed explanation of how they work. Overall, the goal is to address the following two key challenges:

1. Lack of labeled data for some classes: In practice, most real world problems involve unbalanced datasets where certain classes may be underrepresented compared to others. A typical scenario would be a binary classification problem where only a fraction of samples belong to one class. Without sufficient labeled data, it becomes challenging to train accurate models for those rare classes.

2. Data imbalance issues: Most existing approaches focus solely on improving the performance of well-performing models regardless of the distribution of data among different classes. However, if a class contains significantly more data points than others, it could lead to bias towards those classes in terms of selecting features that are most important for prediction. Thus, it becomes essential to take into account the underlying distribution of data among different classes during training to ensure fairness and avoid biases. 

To tackle these two challenges, we propose a novel approach called Self-training for Contextual Representation Enhancement (STRCE) that uses unlabeled data for augmentation purposes. Essentially, the idea behind the proposed framework is to use additional unlabeled data alongside the already labeled data during pre-training and partial annotation phases to supplement the knowledge acquired from the labeled data. During the fine-tuning stage, the newly learnt features from the combination of labeled and unlabeled data are added back to the original model's architecture so that it inherits the benefits of both sources of information. By doing so, the final model is capable of handling scarce labeled data while achieving competitive results against state-of-the-art baselines.
