 As developers we spend more time and effort writing code than any other activity in our lives. In order to write high-quality software, it's essential that we learn how to communicate effectively with non-technical stakeholders such as clients or team members who may not be familiar with programming languages or techniques. The ability to communicate clearly and concisely is key to building strong relationships with your customers and collaborating successfully within an organization. To improve our English skills as programmers, here are three simple steps you can take:
           
          1. Listen Attentively: This means paying attention when communicating. You should always listen carefully to what the other person is saying and make sure you understand their intentions before responding. It's crucial to use clear language and avoid jargon and acronyms unless necessary.

          2. Read Comprehensively: Reading comprehension is critical for learning new technical concepts and technologies, as well as mastering existing ones. Always read multiple times from start to finish so that you're fully absorbed into the content being discussed. This will help you remember important ideas and concepts better.

          3. Practice Conversational English: Writing and speaking in conversational style involves using natural and casual words, making eye contact, emphasizing shared experiences rather than just facts, and using sarcasm and humor to add personality and spice up conversations. Regular practice of these skills can help you become a more effective communicator both verbally and written.

          Overall, improving your English communication skills will help you build stronger and more credible connections with people outside of your field, increase your productivity, and help you gain an edge over those who rely on less structured communication methods. By following these simple steps, you can enhance your professional reputation and confidence, and potentially land a job you love!

         Steps to improve your English communication skill:
            
         1. Pay Attention: Listen attentively. When talking with someone about something, focus on understanding their message and trying to put them at ease. Avoid jumping ahead and assume they know everything.
          
         2. Read Comprehensive: Read thoroughly and try to understand every word, phrase, and idea. Make sure you don't misunderstand anything.
          
         3. Practice Conversational English: Speak naturally and play off personalities. Use appropriate tone and body language to engage with others. Remember that there's no one right way to say things – give examples and showcase your point of view.
          
         4. Express Yourself Clearly: Use precise language and properly punctuate sentences. Never use ambiguous pronouns like "it" or "this." Write short, descriptive paragraphs.
          
         5. Use Correct Grammar and Punctuation: Proper usage of commas, periods, exclamation points, quotes, and parenthesis ensures clarity and consistency across all messages.


          Now let's talk about practical implementation step by step below:

           1. Choose a sample topic: Start by choosing a subject or project where you feel you need to improve your communication skills. Be specific in your request and choose topics that require non-verbal communication such as presentations, documentation, reports, emails, social media posts, blog articles, etc.
            
           2. Plan Out Your Communication Strategy: Create a plan outlining the specific actions you'll take to improve your communications skills. Some possible strategies might include reading widely, taking notes, asking questions, and working with colleagues or mentors.
            
           3. Keep Communicating Regularly: Once you've planned out your strategy, set aside some time each week to really dial in and get comfortable with the process. Try to keep your level of English proficiency constantly updated by reviewing your vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation regularly. Don't wait until the last minute to ask for feedback or seek advice from others – do this continuously throughout the day.
            
           4. Test Your Communication Skills: Finally, test your improvements by applying them to different situations where you're required to speak in front of non-technical stakeholders. Focus on ensuring that your verbal communication is clear, concise, and effective. Remember that even if you don't feel confident in your abilities, you can still learn from criticism and grow through hard work.
