Augmented reality (AR) is one of the most exciting and promising fields in technology today with applications ranging from healthcare to education to entertainment. The use of AR has become increasingly popular in recent years as it offers a range of benefits like improved user experience, enhanced engagement and immersive experiences. 

However, developing high-quality AR applications requires expertise in numerous areas such as computer graphics, virtual reality development, user interface design, programming skills, etc., which can be daunting for many developers who are just starting out in this field. In fact, more than half of all mobile app market share is generated by apps that offer some form of augmented reality functionality. As such, there is a significant need for quality training courses on how to develop AR applications using the latest tools and techniques. 

To address these needs, we at AgTech Oy have developed an Augmented Reality Development course focused specifically towards Android developers who want to master the essential skills required to create high-quality AR applications. This course covers fundamental concepts, algorithms, programming techniques, and best practices needed to build effective AR solutions. We hope that through our course, you will be able to get started quickly and easily creating amazing AR experiences.

2.Google VR Essentials
The core concept behind Google VR is Virtual Reality (VR), which combines the real world with digital worlds. It allows users to virtually explore a new environment or interact with physical objects while immersed in a virtual space. On top of this, Google VR also provides support for hardware devices such as phones, tablets, TVs and cars so users can create rich interactive experiences across multiple platforms.

Google VR Essentials course focuses on teaching the fundamentals of developing VR applications using Unity game engine. Here's what you'll learn:

* Introduction to Virtual Reality and its importance in the Mobile App Ecosystem
* Understanding how different components work together to create a Virtual Environment in Unity
* Building Virtual Objects, Placing them in the Scene, and Applying Physics Properties to them
* Creating User Interface Elements using C# scripts within Unity
* Adding Natural Interaction to your application using Gestures, Hand Tracking, and Object Manipulation
* Integrating Google VR Services into your application to enable multiplayer gaming, teleportation, sharing content among players, etc.

By the end of this course, you should be able to start building high-quality VR applications that provide immersive and interactive experiences to your users. 

3.Audience
This course is intended for Android developers who want to enhance their skill set and improve their proficiency in developing AR/VR applications using Unity game engine. Prior knowledge of Unity and other relevant technologies (such as Java, OpenGL ES) would help, but not mandatory. You do not need any specific technical expertise in the subject area, rather, we will cover the basic principles and ideas required to get up and running with Augmented Reality / Virtual Reality development.

4.Course Structure
We will structure our course based on the following modules:

1. Understanding Virtual Reality
In this module, we will discuss the basics of Virtual Reality and why it's important in modern mobile app ecosystems. We will then dive deeper into the history of Virtual Reality, explain the various types of VR systems available, and describe where AR fits into the mix.

2. Creating Virtual Environments in Unity
In this module, we will focus on getting familiar with the basic components of Virtual Reality development and introducing the fundamentals of working with Unity game engine. By the end of this module, you will be able to place assets in your scene, apply physics properties, add scripts, define boundaries, and handle input events within Unity.

3. Building Interactive Interfaces
In this module, we will introduce the main elements of user interfaces used in VR applications. Specifically, we will look at UI design principles, common interaction patterns, and customizing buttons and menus for your project. By the end of this module, you will understand how to create dynamic and responsive UIs that allow users to navigate and interact with your AR application.

4. Adding Interactivity with Gesture Recognition
Gesture recognition is a crucial component of natural interactivity in Virtual Reality. Within this module, we will explore gesture tracking using hand tracking sensors and integrating gestures into your application. By the end of this module, you will gain hands-on experience with gesture detection and integration, allowing you to bring your application to life with unique, expressive interactions.

5. Adding Multiplayer Functionality to Your Application
Now that you've built your first Virtual Reality application, it's time to expand its capabilities beyond single-user environments. In this module, we will demonstrate how to integrate Google VR services into your application and enable multiplayer gaming scenarios. By the end of this module, you will be able to host and join multiplayer games, communicate with others via chat messages, view shared content, and collaborate on projects.

6. Summary & Further Resources
At the end of the course, you should have a solid understanding of the key concepts, algorithms, and techniques involved in creating Virtual Reality applications using Unity game engine. Additionally, you should be ready to move onto more advanced topics related to augmented reality, such as object placement, lighting, post-processing effects, and rendering optimizations. Finally, we recommend checking out some online resources to continue learning about this cutting edge technology.
