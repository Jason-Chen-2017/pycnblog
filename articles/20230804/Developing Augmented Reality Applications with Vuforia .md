Augmented reality (AR) is an immersive experience that combines virtual elements such as images, videos or other digital content with the real-world environment to create a new sense of being inside the device. With AR applications, users can interact with digital objects in their physical space by manipulating them using hand gestures or voice commands. 

Vuforia is a cloud-based computer vision platform that provides augmented reality capabilities for mobile devices. It offers developers tools like image recognition, object tracking, and scene understanding. Today, we'll learn how to use Vuforia's AR development kit on both Android and iOS platforms to build amazing AR applications. In this article, we will cover:

 - How to get started with developing AR applications using Vuforia?
 - What are the basic concepts behind building an AR application?
 - How to integrate Vuforia into our project and set up the necessary infrastructure?
 - Which steps should I follow while creating an AR application? And what is the order of those steps?
 - How do I create interactive 3D models and scenes within my application?
 - Where can I find more resources to help me develop my AR skills?
 
By the end of this article, you will have learned everything you need to start building your own AR projects using Vuforia. Well done! You deserve it! :) 
 
This tutorial assumes readers' knowledge about app development using Swift or Java programming languages and general familiarity with Apple's Xcode IDE or Android Studio. If you haven't worked with either of these tools before, make sure to check out tutorials for getting started with each tool first.
