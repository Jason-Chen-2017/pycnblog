Softward System Architecture Golden Rule 34: The Circuit Breaker Pattern
=====================================================================

by Zen and the Art of Programming

## 1. Background Introduction

### 1.1 Distributed Systems

In recent years, distributed systems have become increasingly prevalent in software development due to the need for scalability, fault-tolerance, and high availability. These systems consist of multiple services or components that communicate with each other over a network to achieve a common goal.

### 1.2 Microservices Architecture

Microservices architecture is an approach to designing and implementing distributed systems where applications are broken down into small, independent services that communicate through APIs. This allows for greater flexibility, scalability, and resilience compared to monolithic architectures.

### 1.3 Challenges in Distributed Systems

Despite their benefits, distributed systems also present unique challenges, such as network latency, partial failures, and cascading failures. One technique for addressing these challenges is the circuit breaker pattern.

## 2. Core Concepts and Relationships

### 2.1 Circuit Breaker Pattern

The circuit breaker pattern is a design pattern used to prevent cascading failures in distributed systems by introducing a proxy that can detect and respond to failures in upstream services. The circuit breaker has three states: closed, open, and half-open.

#### 2.1.1 Closed State

In the closed state, the circuit breaker allows requests to be sent to the upstream service. If the number of consecutive failures exceeds a predefined threshold, the circuit breaker transitions to the open state.

#### 2.1.2 Open State

In the open state, the circuit breaker blocks all requests to the upstream service for a configurable period of time, allowing the failed service to recover. After this period, the circuit breaker transitions to the half-open state.

#### 2.1.3 Half-Open State

In the half-open state, the circuit breaker allows a limited number of requests to be sent to the upstream service. If any of these requests fail, the circuit breaker immediately transitions back to the open state. If all requests succeed, the circuit breaker transitions back to the closed state.

### 2.2 Relationship to Other Patterns

The circuit breaker pattern can be combined with other patterns, such as bulkheads and timeouts, to further improve the resilience and performance of distributed systems.

#### 2.2.1 Bulkheads

Bulkheads are a design principle used to limit the impact of failures in distributed systems. By partitioning services into smaller units (or "compartments"), failures in one unit do not affect other units.

#### 2.2.2 Timeouts

Timeouts are a mechanism used to limit the amount of time a request can take before it is considered failed. This helps to prevent requests from hanging indefinitely and causing cascading failures.

## 3. Algorithm Principle and Specific Operational Steps

### 3.1 Algorithm Principle

The circuit breaker algorithm works by tracking the number of consecutive failures and transitioning between states based on predefined thresholds.

### 3.2 Specific Operational Steps

1. When a request is made to an upstream service, the circuit breaker checks its current state.
2. If the circuit breaker is in the closed state, the request is allowed to proceed. If the request fails, the circuit breaker increments a failure counter.
3. If the number of consecutive failures exceeds a predefined threshold, the circuit breaker transitions to the open state.
4. In the open state, the circuit breaker blocks all requests to the upstream service for a configurable period of time.
5. After the configured period, the circuit breaker transitions to the half-open state.
6. In the half-open state, the circuit breaker allows a limited number of requests to be sent to the upstream service.
7. If any of these requests fail, the circuit breaker immediately transitions back to the open state. If all requests succeed, the circuit breaker transitions back to the closed state.

### 3.3 Mathematical Model

Let $N$ be the number of consecutive failures required to trigger the circuit breaker, $T$ be the duration of the open state, $M$ be the number of requests allowed during the half-open state, and $p$ be the probability of success for each request. Then the circuit breaker can be modeled as a Markov chain with the following states:

* Closed ($C$): The circuit breaker is allowing requests to be sent to the upstream service.
* Open ($O$): The circuit breaker is blocking all requests to the upstream service.
* Half-Open ($H$): The circuit breaker is allowing a limited number of requests to be sent to the upstream service.

The transition probabilities between states can be calculated as follows:

$$P(C \rightarrow O) = p^N$$

$$P(O \rightarrow H) = 1$$

$$P(H \rightarrow C) = p^M$$

$$P(H \rightarrow O) = 1 - p^M$$

## 4. Best Practices and Code Examples

### 4.1 Implementation Libraries

There are several libraries available for implementing the circuit breaker pattern, including:


### 4.2 Example Code

Here's an example of how to implement the circuit breaker pattern using Resilience4J:
```java
CircuitBreaker circuitBreaker = CircuitBreaker.of("service", CircuitBreakerConfig.custom()
   .failureRateThreshold(50)
   .waitDurationInOpenState(Duration.ofMillis(1000))
   .build());

CircuitBreaker.Metrics metrics = circuitBreaker.getMetrics();

try {
   circuitBreaker.executeCallable(() -> service.doSomething(), result -> {});
} catch (Exception e) {
   // handle exception
}

System.out.println("Failure rate: " + metrics.getFailureRate());
System.out.println("Number of calls: " + metrics.getNumberOfCalls());
System.out.println("Number of successful calls: " + metrics.getNumberOfSuccessfulCalls());
System.out.println("Number of failed calls: " + metrics.getNumberOfFailedCalls());
```
### 4.3 Configuring Thresholds

When configuring the circuit breaker, it's important to choose appropriate thresholds for the failure rate, wait duration in open state, and number of requests allowed during the half-open state. These values will depend on the specific requirements and characteristics of the system being designed.

## 5. Real-World Applications

The circuit breaker pattern has been successfully applied in many real-world applications, such as:

* Netflix's Hystrix library, which was originally developed for their microservices architecture.
* Twitter's Failure Injection Testing framework, which uses the circuit breaker pattern to simulate failures in order to test the resilience of their systems.
* LinkedIn's use of the circuit breaker pattern to improve the reliability and performance of their data pipelines.

## 7. Summary and Future Directions

The circuit breaker pattern is a powerful tool for improving the resilience and performance of distributed systems. By detecting and responding to failures in upstream services, the circuit breaker can prevent cascading failures and improve the overall availability and reliability of the system. As more and more systems move towards microservices architectures, the need for circuit breakers and other patterns that address the challenges of distributed systems will only continue to grow.

## 8. FAQ

**Q:** What is the difference between the circuit breaker pattern and timeouts?

**A:** Timeouts limit the amount of time a request can take before it is considered failed, while the circuit breaker pattern prevents requests from being sent to failed or unresponsive services. Both patterns can be used together to improve the resilience and performance of distributed systems.

**Q:** How do I choose appropriate thresholds for the circuit breaker?

**A:** Choosing appropriate thresholds for the circuit breaker depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the system being designed. A good starting point is to set the failure rate threshold to a value that reflects the desired level of reliability, and to set the wait duration in open state and number of requests allowed during the half-open state based on empirical observations of the system's behavior.

**Q:** Can the circuit breaker pattern be used in non-distributed systems?

**A:** While the circuit breaker pattern was originally developed for distributed systems, it can also be useful in non-distributed systems where there is a risk of cascading failures due to dependencies on external resources or components. However, the specific implementation and configuration of the circuit breaker may differ depending on the context.
