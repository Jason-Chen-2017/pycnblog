Let's dive into the details of each section.

### 1.1. Dynamic Programming vs. Dynamic Computing
Dynamic programming and dynamic computing are often used interchangeably, but they have different meanings. Dynamic programming is a technique for solving optimization problems and recurrence relations, while dynamic computing refers to the use of dynamic data structures and algorithms to improve the efficiency of programs.

### 1.2. Dynamic Programming vs. Divide and Conquer
Dynamic programming and divide and conquer are both techniques for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems. However, there are some key differences between the two.

- Divide and Conquer: This technique involves recursively dividing the problem into smaller subproblems until they become simple enough to solve directly. The solutions to the subproblems are then combined to obtain the solution to the original problem.

- Dynamic Programming: In dynamic programming, the subproblems are solved in a bottom-up manner, starting from the simplest subproblems and gradually building up to the solution of the original problem. The solutions to the subproblems are stored in a table or data structure, allowing for efficient reuse of previously computed solutions.

### 1.3. Dynamic Programming vs. Greedy Algorithms
Greedy algorithms and dynamic programming are both techniques for solving optimization problems. However, they differ in their approach to finding the optimal solution.

- Greedy Algorithms: These algorithms make the best choice at each step, hoping that the local optimum will lead to the global optimum. They do not consider the future decisions and often fail to find the optimal solution.

- Dynamic Programming: In dynamic programming, the optimal solution is found by considering all possible decisions and their consequences. It takes into account the future decisions and ensures that the optimal solution is found.

Now that we have a basic understanding of dynamic programming, let's move on to the core concepts and relationships.

## 2. Core Concepts and Relationships
In this section, we will explore the core concepts of dynamic programming, including overlapping subproblems, optimal substructure, and memoization.

### 2.1. Overlapping Subproblems
Overlapping subproblems are a key concept in dynamic programming. An overlapping subproblem is a subproblem that occurs multiple times in the solution of a larger problem. By solving each subproblem only once and storing the solution, we can avoid redundant computations and improve the efficiency of the algorithm.

### 2.2. Optimal Substructure
Optimal substructure is another important concept in dynamic programming. A problem has optimal substructure if the optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblems. In other words, the optimal solution to the problem can be obtained by combining the optimal solutions of its subproblems.

### 2.3. Memoization
Memoization is a technique used in dynamic programming to store the solutions to subproblems in a table or data structure. By looking up the solution to a subproblem in the table instead of computing it from scratch, we can avoid redundant computations and improve the efficiency of the algorithm.

Now that we have a good understanding of the core concepts, let's move on to the algorithm principles and operational steps, along with the mathematical models.

## 3. Algorithm Principles and Operational Steps, along with Mathematical Models
In this section, we will discuss the algorithm principles and operational steps involved in dynamic programming, as well as the mathematical models used to represent the problems.

### 3.1. Algorithm Principles
The algorithm principles of dynamic programming include:

1. Breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems.
2. Solving the subproblems in a bottom-up manner.
3. Storing the solutions to the subproblems in a table or data structure.
4. Using the stored solutions to construct the solution to the original problem.

### 3.2. Operational Steps
The operational steps involved in dynamic programming are as follows:

1. Identify the overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure in the problem.
2. Define a table or data structure to store the solutions to the subproblems.
3. Initialize the table with the base cases or initial conditions.
4. Fill in the table by solving the subproblems in a bottom-up manner.
5. Use the stored solutions to construct the solution to the original problem.

### 3.3. Mathematical Models
The mathematical models used in dynamic programming are typically recursive equations or recurrence relations. These models represent the relationship between the solution of a subproblem and the solutions of its subproblems. By solving the recurrence relation, we can obtain the solution to the original problem.

For example, consider the problem of finding the nth Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

The recurrence relation for the Fibonacci sequence can be represented as:

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

By solving this recurrence relation, we can obtain the solution to the problem of finding the nth Fibonacci number.

Now that we have a good understanding of the algorithm principles and operational steps, let's move on to the code examples and detailed explanations.

## 4. Code Examples and Detailed Explanations
In this section, we will provide code examples and detailed explanations of dynamic programming problems in Ruby.

### 4.1. Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci sequence is a simple example of a dynamic programming problem. We can solve it using a bottom-up approach, starting from the base cases and gradually building up to the solution of the original problem.

Here is the code to compute the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming in Ruby:

```ruby
def fibonacci(n)
  return n if n <= 1

  # Initialize the table with the base cases
  fib = Array.new(n + 1, 0)
  fib[0] = 0
  fib[1] = 1

  # Fill in the table in a bottom-up manner
  (2..n).each do |i|
    fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2]
  end

  # Return the nth Fibonacci number
  fib[n]
end
```

In this code, we first check if `n` is less than or equal to 1, which are the base cases of the Fibonacci sequence. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, we simply return `n`.

Next, we initialize the `fib` array with the base cases. The `fib` array will store the Fibonacci numbers for each index.

Then, we fill in the `fib` array in a bottom-up manner. Starting from index 2, we compute the Fibonacci number at each index by summing the Fibonacci numbers at the previous two indices.

Finally, we return the Fibonacci number at index `n`.

### 4.2. Longest Common Subsequence
The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is another example of a dynamic programming problem. Given two sequences, the LCS problem aims to find the longest subsequence that is common to both sequences.

Here is the code to compute the LCS using dynamic programming in Ruby:

```ruby
def longest_common_subsequence(s1, s2)
  # Initialize the table with the base cases
  m = s1.length
  n = s2.length
  dp = Array.new(m + 1) { Array.new(n + 1, 0) }

  # Fill in the table in a bottom-up manner
  (1..m).each do |i|
    (1..n).each do |j|
      if s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1]
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
      else
        dp[i][j] = [dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]].max
      end
    end
  end

  # Return the length of the longest common subsequence
  dp[m][n]
end
```

In this code, we first initialize the `dp` table with the base cases. The `dp` table will store the lengths of the longest common subsequences for each pair of indices in the two sequences.

Then, we fill in the `dp` table in a bottom-up manner. For each pair of indices, we compare the characters at those indices. If the characters are equal, we increment the length of the longest common subsequence by 1. If the characters are not equal, we take the maximum length from the previous row or column.

Finally, we return the length of the longest common subsequence.

Now that we have seen some code examples, let's discuss the future trends and challenges in dynamic programming.
