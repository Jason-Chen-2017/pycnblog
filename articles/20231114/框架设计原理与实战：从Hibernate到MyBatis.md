最近几年，ORM技术在Java世界中越来越受欢迎，已经成为主流技术之一。Hibernate、mybatis等开源框架也逐渐流行起来，这些框架的出现极大的方便了开发人员的编码工作，减少了编写DAO层的代码量。然而对于一些有经验的开发人员来说，使用这些框架仍然存在很多陌生和不熟悉的地方。因此本文旨在对ORM技术以及最流行的Java框架Hibernate、Mybatis进行详尽且深入的研究。
# 2.核心概念与联系
ORM（Object-Relational Mapping）即对象关系映射，是一个实现面向对象编程技术的程序技术。它通过使用已存在于数据库中的表结构信息，将关系数据转换成对象并进行操作，让开发人员可以用面向对象的思维方式来处理关系数据库。由于关系数据库的独特特性，它天然支持复杂查询、事务管理、索引及关联查询等高级功能。同时它还能有效地解决对象关系映射带来的性能问题。
Hibernate是Java界最流行的ORM框架之一。它的主要功能包括对象/关系映射、查询语言、缓存、CRUD操作、事务管理等。它能够自动生成SQL语句并执行，提升了程序员的效率。相比于 MyBatis，Hibernate更加关注底层细节，而且可以直接集成Spring等框架进行使用。
MyBatis则是另一个流行的Java ORM框架。它提供了简洁灵活的XML配置文件，使得开发人员可以将精力集中在业务逻辑上，而不需要关心数据库的相关知识。与 Hibernate 不同的是，MyBatis 使用预编译语句，能显著提升程序运行速度。

# Framework Design Principles and Practice: From Hibernate to Mybatis

## Introduction 

In recent years, Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) has become a popular programming technique in Java world. There are several open source frameworks like Hibernate, mybatis, etc., which have made development easier by mapping object to database tables. However, for experienced developers who have used these frameworks beforehand, there is still a lot of mystery and unfamiliar parts when they use them. This article will focus on the ORM technology as well as some popular Java frameworks like Hibernate and Mybatis with extensive explanations and analysis of core concepts such as SQL injection, caching, serialization, transactions, query language, DAO design patterns, plugin architecture, security, and deployment strategies. We'll also discuss current and future trends and challenges in this field along with various real life examples and observations from the industry. Finally, we will address common issues and provide solutions for easy reference while writing code using these technologies.


## Background

ORM stands for "Object Relational Mapping" which is a Programming Technique that allows you to map objects into relational databases or vice versa. The primary objective of an ORM system is to simplify application development and make it easier to access and manipulate data stored in a relational database. With advancements in Database Management Systems and Query Languages over the past few years, ORM systems offer better performance, scalability and control compared to traditional SQL coding. But as all things in software engineering, it comes with certain drawbacks including complexity, increased learning curve, reliability concerns and vendor lock-in. It's essential to understand how different ORMs work under the hood so that you can choose the best one for your project based on specific requirements and constraints. 


## Core Concepts & Relationships

### What Is An ORM System?

An ORM System is designed to convert data between objects and relational databases. This involves two main components: 

1. A Data Access Layer - This layer provides an abstraction layer between the user’s application logic and the underlying database management system. It hides the details of connection handling, querying, caching, transaction management, validation, etc. It interacts with the higher level layers only through standardized interfaces.

2. A Mappers - These classes define how objects should be mapped to the corresponding database table. They accept input parameters, execute queries, and retrieve results from the database. They act as middle-men between the domain model and the database schema. Each mapper knows exactly what needs to be fetched, inserted, updated, deleted and return back the resultant object. It contains methods to insert, update, delete records, fetch records, and perform custom operations on data. 


### Different Types Of ORM Systems

There are three main types of ORM Systems:

1. Classical ORM Systems - These systems require explicit mapping files containing instructions about how objects should be mapped to the respective database tables. They generate SQL statements automatically based on the defined mappings. Examples include Hibernate, TopLink, iBATIS, etc. 

2. Proxied ORM Systems - These systems operate on a remote database server where proxy libraries are installed to handle all the database communication. Examples include EJB 3 Objects, JPA (Java Persistence API), etc. 

3. Code-generated ORM Systems - These systems allow developers to create their own mapping files without any manual intervention. Instead of generating SQL statements at runtime, they directly compile the java code generated by the IDE and run it against the target database. Examples include Ibatis2, MyBatis, etc. 


### How Does An ORM Work Under The Hood?

Let’s assume that you want to fetch a record from a MySQL database and store its contents in a JAVA object. Here are the steps involved in the process: 

1. You need to establish a connection with the database using JDBC driver. 
2. Write an SQL statement to select the required information from the database. 
3. Execute the SQL statement using the prepared statement mechanism provided by the JDBC driver. 
4. Parse the results returned by the database and set the appropriate properties of the JAVA object. 
5. Commit the changes to the database if necessary. 
This entire process happens behind the scenes, making it very efficient and seamless. Now let’s see how each component works individually. 


#### 1. Connection Handling

Connection Handling refers to managing the lifecycle of the database connections. When an application starts up, it initializes the required drivers and establishes a connection with the database. During this phase, the system checks whether the specified credentials are valid, creates the required sessions, sets up the necessary environment variables, etc. Once the connection is established successfully, other components of the application can begin working with the database. If an error occurs during this stage, the system reports it to the user. 

#### 2. Prepared Statement Mechanism

Prepared Statements refer to preparing an SQL statement with placeholders for input values. In case of executing multiple queries with varying parameter values, this approach improves performance by reducing network overhead. Placeholders represent the actual value assigned later in the execution phase. 

For example, consider the following SELECT statement:

    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id =? AND department =?;
    
When executed with placeholder markers (?), the system replaces those marks with the actual parameter values passed as arguments to the prepared statement method. For example:

    String empId = "E1";
    String deptName = "Sales";
    PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id =? AND department =?");
    stmt.setString(1, empId); // replace first placeholder marker with empId
    stmt.setString(2, deptName); // replace second placeholder marker with deptName
    ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();
    
The above example fetches all the rows from the 'employees' table where the employee id is 'E1' and belongs to the Sales Department. 

#### 3. Parsing Results And Setting Properties Of The JAVA Object

Once the SQL query is executed and the results are obtained, the system parses the output columns of the retrieved rows and assigns the appropriate values to the corresponding properties of the JAVA object. At this point, you may want to add additional business rules or validations to ensure that the retrieved data adheres to the expected format and fulfills all the business requirements. 

#### 4. Transaction Management

Transaction Management is responsible for ensuring consistency and atomicity of the data updates within the database. Transactions involve multiple actions performed either completely or partially atomically. By grouping related operations together in a single transaction, you can minimize the risk of data corruption and improve overall system performance. Transactions typically take place within a dedicated context, which guarantees ACID properties like Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.
