# 1.背景介绍


Operators are software extensions that provide operational automation for applications running on top of a Kubernetes cluster. They automate tasks such as deployment, scaling, and configuration management by extending the API surface of Kubernetes with custom resources. In this article, we will discuss what operators are, why they're needed, how they work, and some common use cases. We'll also cover key terminology and concepts related to operators including Custom Resources (CRs), Controller Reconcilers, Webhooks, Mutating Admission Controllers, and Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). Finally, we'll discuss several tools used for developing and managing operators like KUDO, Operator SDK, and OperatorHub.

In Kubernetes, operators act at the control-plane level by watching the state of cluster objects and reconciling them with desired state defined by users through CRDs or controllers. They are designed to make it easier to manage complex systems, enforce policies, and maintain consistent operation across multiple clusters and environments. Additionally, operators can be written using various programming languages such as Go, Python, and Ansible and can be deployed on any Kubernetes cluster regardless of its size, complexity, or version. This makes operators an essential tool for building reliable and scalable solutions running on Kubernetes.

This article assumes readers have a basic understanding of Kubernetes and the relevant concepts such as Deployments, Pods, Services, Namespaces, ConfigMaps, Secrets, etc., and is suitable for beginners who want to learn more about operators and how they can help simplify their workflows and operations. If you need further explanations or additional context, please refer to other resources available online.

# 2.Core Concepts and Relationships
## What are Operators?
An operator is a software extension that extends the functionality of Kubernetes by adding new features or managing existing ones. It automates repetitive tasks, improves observability, and simplifies cluster administration. They rely heavily on Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) and controller patterns to ensure consistency between user input and system state. Each operator typically includes two components:

1. Custom Resource Definition (CRD): A specification of the kind of resource that the operator manages and the expected behavior of the resource. For example, if we define a `MyApp` custom resource, the operator would expect certain fields and annotations within those resources.

2. Controller: A loop that watches the state of all instances of a particular type of resource, ensures that each instance conforms to the desired state, and attempts to correct it otherwise. The controller uses informers to receive updates from the Kubernetes API server and reacts accordingly by creating/updating/deleting objects to match the desired state.

The core concept behind operators is encapsulation of operational logic and provides a higher-level abstraction than individual APIs. Users create and modify CRDs, which then trigger corresponding events in the system via the controllers.

## Why do we Need Operators?
As mentioned earlier, operators are necessary because Kubernetes doesn't provide enough flexibility to support complex applications and services. One reason for this is the lack of standardization and automation around these resources, which leads to inconsistencies and potential security risks. Another problem is that developers don't always understand the inner workings of Kubernetes and may try to implement their own solution without considering how interoperable it could become. By implementing common patterns and best practices, operators can greatly improve developer productivity and reduce errors. Some popular use cases include:

1. Configuration Management: With operators, we can easily manage configurations for our applications, making it easier to scale and update.

2. Application Life Cycle Management: Operators can help streamline application deployments, upgrades, and maintenance processes, ensuring that apps run reliably and smoothly.

3. Observability: Operators can monitor and report on the health and status of applications running on top of Kubernetes, providing insight into issues and trends.

4. Security: Operators can enforce security policies and governance structures, such as mutual TLS authentication, network isolation, role-based access controls, and auditing logs.

## How Do Operators Work?
When a request is made to deploy an application on Kubernetes, the following steps occur:

1. User creates a Deployment object in the cluster specifying the container image to be used and the number of replicas required.

2. Kubelet receives the request and sends it to the apiserver where it's validated and stored in etcd.

3. Deployment controller watches for changes in the Deployment resource and creates pods based on the requested specifications.

4. Kubelet continuously watches the newly created pod(s) and sends them back to the apiserver along with information about the node and volume mounts.

5. When all containers in a pod are ready, the kubelet marks the pod as running and pushes a start event to the apiserver.

6. The service controller detects the creation of a new Service resource and creates one automatically or assigns IP addresses to existing endpoints.

7. After the user runs the command to expose a port on the Service, kube-proxy sets up iptables rules to forward traffic to the appropriate backend pods based on load balancing algorithms specified in the Service spec.

Now let's consider the lifecycle of an operator. Once installed, the following happens:

1. OLM installs the operator chart to a Kubernetes cluster, which deploys the necessary RBAC roles and bindings to allow the operator to interact with the Kubernetes API.

2. Once the operator pod starts running, the leader election process begins and selects one of the operator replicas as the leader.

3. Leader replica identifies all CRDs that the operator should watch, creates informer(s) for each CRD, and registers callbacks to be called when a change occurs to the corresponding CR.

4. Informer watches the corresponding CRs and passes events to the registered callback function. Callback function performs the necessary actions, such as creating new Kubernetes resources or updating the status field of the CR.

5. When a delete event is received for a CR, the corresponding callback function handles cleanup tasks before deleting the CR itself.

To summarize, operators enable declarative API management by abstracting underlying Kubernetes constructs and enforcing policy and workflow constraints. They help users deploy applications consistently, efficiently, and securely while improving overall operability and efficiency.
