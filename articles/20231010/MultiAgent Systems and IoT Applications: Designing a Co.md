## Multi-agent system (MAS)
A multi-agent system (MAS), also known as agent-based systems or autonomous agents, is a computing model that allows multiple independent entities to operate cooperatively in a shared environment. MAS can be used for modeling physical and social processes such as transportation networks, economic models, healthcare systems, and security systems, among others. The goal of an MAS is to simulate the behavior of interacting agents within its environment based on their individual goals, desires, plans, and beliefs. Each agent executes actions locally without considering the actions or perceptions of other agents; instead, it relies on a shared information space and interaction with external entities to achieve global objectives. Despite their fundamental differences from traditional software design patterns, MAS are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to handle complex decision-making tasks across various domains. 

The Internet of Things (IoT) represents another exciting application domain where MAS can help improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance productivity. By connecting devices together and exchanging data over the internet, we can build more powerful machines, sensors, actuators, and systems. However, deploying large-scale IoT applications requires careful consideration of how to communicate between these distributed nodes efficiently. In this paper, I will focus on the problem of communication protocol design in the context of developing robust and scalable IoT applications using multi-agent systems. Specifically, I will present a detailed look at two commonly used communication protocols—MQTT and WebSocket—and explain their advantages and limitations in terms of performance, scalability, and security. Based on my analysis, I hope to provide insight into the role of communication protocol in enabling efficient and secure communications in IoT applications and inspire developers to consider new approaches for improving communication protocol selection and implementation.


## MQTT and WebSocket

MQTT and WebSocket are two widely used protocols in the field of IoT communication. Both protocols allow communication between different clients on the same server or between servers and client applications. The main difference between them lies in the underlying transport layer technology they use. For example, MQTT uses TCP/IP while WebSocket uses HTTP. Additionally, MQTT supports quality of service levels which ensure delivery of messages at least once and exactly once. On the contrary, WebSocket provides real-time messaging but does not guarantee message delivery. To better understand the key features of each protocol, let's take a closer look at their architecture diagrams.

### MQTT Architecture Diagram


In the above diagram, you can see that both MQTT and WebSocket have a similar structure consisting of three layers - Network, Transport, and Application. 

On the network layer, MQTT operates over TCP/IP while WebSocket operates over HTTP(S). This means that MQTT can support high throughput and low latency connections while WebSocket offers full duplex communication and supports bi-directional communication.

On the transport layer, MQTT uses the publish-subscribe pattern while WebSocket uses the request-response pattern. This means that MQTT provides point-to-point connectivity whereas WebSocket provides full-duplex communication. Additionally, MQTT has built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms, while WebSocket only supports Basic Authentication.

Finally, on the application layer, MQTT supports several QoS levels (at most once, at least once, and exactly once) while WebSocket supports text and binary messages. While MQTT is lightweight and designed for resource-constrained environments, WebSocket is suitable for web browsers, mobile devices, and other interactive applications.

### MQTT vs WebSocket Advantages and Limitations

#### MQTT Advantages

1. Support for Quality of Service Levels

   Both MQTT and WebSocket offer quality of service levels. MQTT’s supported levels include At Most Once (QoS=0), At Least Once (QoS=1), and Exactly Once (QoS=2). With QoS=1 and QoS=2, messages are guaranteed to be delivered either once or twice, respectively.

   

2. Connectionless Mode

   MQTT supports connectionless mode which means that there is no need to establish a separate connection before transmitting messages. Instead, clients can directly send packets to the broker through any available channel. 

   

3. Scalability

   Since MQTT runs over TCP/IP, it scales well even when thousands of clients connect simultaneously. This makes it ideal for building real-time IoT applications that require high scalability.



#### MQTT Limitations

1. No Retained Messages

   MQTT does not support retained messages like WebSocket does. Retained messages are important because they enable clients to receive previously published messages immediately upon subscribing to a topic. Without retained messages, clients would need to wait until the next message arrives. 

2. No Message Ordering Guarantees

   MQTT does not guarantee the order of messages sent by different clients to a single topic. This may result in inconsistent ordering of messages received by subscribers. If message order matters, then WebSocket should be used instead.

3. Topic Names Length Restrictions

   MQTT limits the length of topic names to 65535 bytes, compared to unlimited length allowed by WebSocket. Longer topics may cause problems with some brokers.
