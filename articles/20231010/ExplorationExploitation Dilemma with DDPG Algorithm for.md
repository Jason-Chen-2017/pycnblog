Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) is a powerful and widely used policy gradient algorithm that can be applied to various continuous control problems, such as robotic navigation tasks, vehicle control tasks, and other practical applications requiring high-dimensional action spaces or real-time decisions. The basic idea of DDPG is to use two deep neural networks to represent the actor network (policy function) and critic network (value function), respectively. In each iteration, the actor learns how to map observations to actions by updating its parameters based on the gradients calculated from the critic's evaluation. On the other hand, the critic learns how well the current policy performs by evaluating the expected return given an observation and an action, using an estimated value function approximation. By balancing these two objectives, DDPG can learn policies capable of efficiently navigating through complex environments while exploring new regions effectively and avoiding local minima. However, there are several challenges in applying DDPG to continuous control problems, including:

1. **Exploration/exploitation dilemma**: One essential problem in DDPG is the exploration-exploitation dilemma, which occurs when the agent chooses between exploring new regions to improve its performance and exploiting the knowledge it has accumulated so far to maximize its reward at every step. Intuitively, if we have explored enough, we may not find any more beneficial actions to take. Therefore, one popular way to address this challenge is to use a trade-off parameter $\epsilon$ to balance the ratio of exploration and exploitation during training. Specifically, we randomly choose some actions according to the current policy with probability $1-\epsilon$, and explore the environment uniformly at random with probability $\epsilon$.

2. **Stabilization of learning**: Another important issue is related to stability and convergence of learning in continuous domains. Despite being able to handle large state and action spaces, DDPG often fails to converge due to instability issues caused by correlations among different dimensions of states or actions. To stabilize learning, we add noise to the actions taken by the actors and make sure that they do not exceed certain bounds, which helps prevent the policy from oscillations or diverging behaviors.

3. **Handling sparse rewards**: While DDPG was originally designed for reinforcement learning problems with dense rewards, recent research has shown that it can also work well in problems where sparse rewards are commonplace, such as those arising from human reinforcement learning scenarios. Despite its success on many benchmark tasks, however, developing algorithms that can cope with sparse rewards remains a significant challenge.

In this article, we will discuss the details of the above three points in detail. We will start by presenting the core concepts behind DDPG and explaining their relationships with other policy gradient methods. Then, we will focus our attention on solving the exploration-exploitation dilemma, demonstrated by OpenAI gym environments, and describe the necessary modifications to the original algorithm. Finally, we will show how DDPG can handle sparse rewards by introducing techniques such as HER and RainbowDQN. This approach provides a promising direction towards addressing the shortcomings of traditional model-free RL approaches for continuous control problems. 

Before starting, let us note that although DDPG is a powerful algorithm, it requires careful tuning of hyperparameters and proper architecture design to achieve good results on various control tasks. Thus, it is crucial to carefully consider the specifics of your application scenario before applying this method. Moreover, keep in mind that even though DDPG works well across a wide range of control tasks, it does not guarantee optimality and robustness in all cases, and further research is needed to fully exploit its strengths and potential drawbacks. Nevertheless, despite these limitations, DDPG still remains an effective tool for rapid prototyping and experimentation on continuous control tasks.
