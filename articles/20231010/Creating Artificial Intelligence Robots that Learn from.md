# 1.背景介绍


Robotics is a growing field of research in the computer science domain with applications ranging from agriculture to industrial automation. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as an important branch of robotics because it can learn from experience and solve complex tasks more effectively than humans. 

Creating AI-powered robots capable of learning from experience presents various challenges for both hardware and software engineers. The first challenge is related to processing and storing large amounts of data, which demands efficient algorithms and scalable computing architectures. The second challenge lies in building intelligent systems that can adapt quickly to new environments or changes in situations by utilizing learning algorithms such as reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and deep learning. Furthermore, creating these AI-powered robots requires a considerable amount of human expertise and effort. Despite all these challenges, there are several successful projects dedicated solely to this task such as RoboCup Soccer Simulation League [1] and ABB YuMi [2]. 

In this article, we will focus on developing one type of robot called "learning assistants" that can help address some of the limitations of current solutions. Learning assistants offer the potential of being cheap and versatile because they do not require specialized hardware components like powerful computers or advanced sensors. However, their ability to learn from experience through trial and error may be limited due to factors such as sample complexity, noise in perception, and incorrect prior assumptions about the problem at hand. Therefore, understanding how best to approach designing such systems will provide valuable insights into the development of future robotics technologies. 


The goal of our project is to develop a learning assistant system capable of autonomous navigation in cluttered environments using visual input. We plan to build a modular system comprising multiple modules including camera, path planning algorithm, neural network, motion controller, and communication protocol. Each module would work collaboratively to achieve a comprehensive solution to the problem of autonomous navigation in cluttered environments. Our target platform for the project is the UR5 robot arm, a lightweight, versatile robot designed specifically for manipulation and assembly tasks.


Our approach to solving this problem involves three main steps:

1. Collecting training datasets: We need to collect diverse training data sets consisting of different objects, background scenes, and environments. This step is essential for training the neural networks used later in the system. The collected datasets should also contain noisy samples, occlusions, and other types of distractor images that might interfere with the performance of the learned model. 

2. Building the framework: Next, we need to create a modular system architecture that consists of multiple independent modules. Each module could include different subsystems such as a camera, path planning algorithm, neural network, motion controller, and communication protocol. These modules should interact seamlessly and communicate with each other to provide the required functionality. 

3. Training the neural network(s): Finally, we train the neural network(s) that will be responsible for identifying the object classes present in the environment. The trained neural networks should have high accuracy but also low latency, making them suitable for real-time application on resource-constrained platforms. 

Overall, our objective is to develop a cost-effective and reliable learning assistant system that can help robots navigate in cluttered environments while also avoiding collisions and obstacles. By combining machine learning techniques with low-cost hardware components, we hope to leverage the power of the internet of things to advance robotics research and education.

This section introduces key concepts and ideas relevant to the proposed system architecture and implementation details. 

## Autonomous Navigation and Cluttered Environments
Autonomous navigation refers to the process of a robotic agent navigating independently without any external assistance. One common use case of autonomous navigation is for mobile robots and drones, where they can take over tasks previously performed by people. When performing complex tasks such as exploring unknown terrains, operating factory equipment, or delivering packages, robots must navigate safely and efficiently in dynamic environments that are often full of uncertain obstacles, forces, and variations in lighting conditions. 

Cluttered environments refer to scenarios in which the space around the robot contains many similar objects, such as cans, balls, boxes, etc., causing the robot's perceptive capabilities to become impaired. Additionally, cluttered environments pose additional challenges for robot navigation because the robot must reliably identify its surroundings and reason about which actions to take to move forward. Current solutions for handling cluttered environments typically involve detecting the presence of nearby objects and adjusting the course of movement accordingly. 

To address these challenges, we propose developing a learning assistant system that can perform autonomous navigation in cluttered environments using only visual input. Specifically, we aim to design a modular system comprising multiple independent modules for visual perception, path planning, decision making, and control. Each module would work together to provide the desired functionality within a unified pipeline. Our primary concern is ensuring robust and accurate perception of objects, even under extreme conditions such as bright sunlight or heavy traffic. To achieve this, we will deploy a novel neural network-based approach known as Real-Time Neural Style Transfer (RTNST).

## Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning
Reinforcement learning is a machine learning technique that enables agents to learn to optimize rewards in an interactive environment. It learns to select actions based on feedback received from the environment and updates its policy accordingly. Imitation learning is another machine learning technique that aims to mimic the behavior of a human demonstrator to guide the learning of an agent. Unlike reinforcement learning, imitation learning does not require interaction with the environment, requiring only observations and expert policies.

We use reinforcement learning for self-supervised learning of object categories in cluttered environments. During training, the robot uses its own sensor readings alongside RGB-D image inputs to generate a set of representations that encode spatial and appearance information for the observed objects. These representations serve as inputs to a separate neural network that predicts the category label associated with each representation. The network weights are then adjusted based on the predicted labels so that subsequent observations produce better predictions. This process forms the basis for self-supervised learning of object categories in cluttered environments.

Imitation learning provides another way to improve the generalization capability of the learning assistant system. Rather than relying exclusively on supervised learning methods that rely heavily on labeled examples, we can use imitation learning to train the system to follow expert demonstrations provided by a personnel supervisor. We can collect a variety of demonstrated behaviors and store them in memory as trajectories. Then, during training, the system can replay these trajectories and adjust its motor control signals according to the predicted outcomes. This allows the learning assistant system to learn faster and more accurately when interacting with the environment.

## Real-Time Neural Style Transfer (RTNST)
Real-Time Neural Style Transfer (RTNST), also known as Fast Neural Style Transfer (FNTS), is a method for transferring the style of a source image onto a target image. FNTS was introduced by Johnson et al. in 2016 and has since become a popular choice for image stylization and transformation. RTNST extends traditional FNTS by incorporating a recurrent neural network (RNN) that captures temporal dependencies between pixel sequences in addition to spatially distributed features. It can transfer the style of a scene in real-time, allowing us to apply the same styles to a live feed taken by the robot’s camera. 

We can use RTNST to extract features from the RGB-D image streams captured by the robot’s camera and use them as inputs to the classifier that predicts the object categories present in the scene. We can also use RTNST to preprocess the raw image stream before passing it to the neural network, improving the quality of the input features. Lastly, we can combine RTNST with imitation learning to enhance the diversity and smoothness of the generated trajectories, providing a higher degree of exploration of the environment. Overall, our objective is to train a learning assistant system using visual input that can handle cluttered environments while generating safe and effective trajectories for moving the robot towards specific goals.
