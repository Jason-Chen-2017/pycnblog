# 1.背景介绍


## Image processing is the process of manipulating digital images or videos to produce new information or value. It involves various techniques such as image segmentation, feature detection, object recognition, and filtering and editing of images. Many applications like photography, industrial automation, medicine, security, agriculture, sports analytics, video surveillance are using computer vision for their products and services. In this article, we will explore several fundamental concepts related to image processing using Python programming language. We will also demonstrate how these concepts can be implemented in code. The focus of this article will be on practical implementation of algorithms using OpenCV library in Python. 

## Objectives
* Understand fundamentals of image processing
* Apply image processing techniques in real-world scenarios
* Write clean and well-organized code using Python programming language
* Utilize open source libraries for image processing in Python


This is an advanced level technical blog article that requires knowledge of basic programming skills including data structures, functions, control flow statements, loops, conditional statements, file handling, etc., but not necessarily deep mathematical knowledge or machine learning background. However, if you have some prior experience in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Image Processing, or any other field that relates closely to image manipulation, then it would help you understand and appreciate the added depth of content provided here.

To get started, let's begin by exploring some important concepts in image processing along with their implementations using Python and OpenCV library.


# 2.Core Concepts & Terminology
In order to effectively manipulate digital images, we need to learn about its core concepts and terminology. Here are few terms and their definitions you should familiarize yourself with:

1. **Image:** An image is simply a two-dimensional array of pixels (points) arranged in rows and columns. Each pixel contains color information which can be represented in different formats such as RGB (Red-Green-Blue), HSV (Hue-Saturation-Value), CMYK (Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black), Grayscale, YCbCr (luma-chroma chrominance), XYZ (X-Y-Z), Lab, and many more. Images typically come from multiple sources such as cameras, scanners, microscopes, SLRs, DSLRs, or photographs taken by hand.

2. **Pixel:** A single point within an image. Each pixel has red, green, blue values representing colors of different wavelengths. Pixels may also contain additional features such as spatial coordinates, brightness, sharpness, and contrast. 

3. **Resolution:** Resolution refers to the number of pixels present in an image. Common resolutions include high-definition (HD), full HD, standard definition (SD), and low-definition (LD). Higher the resolution, better the quality of the image. Also, lower the resolution, faster the processing speed. However, higher the resolution, larger the storage required.

4. **Color Spaces:** Color spaces represent the way colors are perceived by the human eye. There are different types of color spaces such as RGB, HSL, HSV, CMYK, YUV, and many others. Some common color spaces used in image processing are RGB, BGR, HSV, HSL, and LAB. 

5. **Color Model:** A model describes a set of properties used to describe color characteristics of objects under observation. For example, the RGB (red-green-blue) color space is based on additive primary colors: Red, Green, Blue; while CYMK (cyan-magenta-yellow-black) is based on subtractive colors: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black. 

 
6. **Histogram:** Histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of gray levels in an image. It shows us the frequency count of each intensity level in an image. A histogram gives us a general idea about how an image appears. If there is a dominant peak in the histogram, then we know that the image has a good contrast between light and dark areas.

7. **Binary Image:** Binary image is one where all the pixel intensities have only two possible values: either black or white. This type of image is useful when working with simple shapes, textures, and edges. It allows us to perform binary operations such as thresholding, erosion/dilation, opening/closing, connected component labeling, and much more. 


# 3.Fundamental Algorithms in Image Processing 
We now know what an image is and what it consists of. Now let's talk about the most commonly used algorithms in image processing. Let's start with the basics first and move towards complex topics later:

1. **Thresholding:** Thresholding is a technique to binarize an image into foreground and background regions. It converts every pixel value above a certain threshold value to maximum intensity and those below the threshold to zero. Commonly used thresholding techniques are Otsu's method, adaptive thresholding, and global thresholding. These methods are applied to individual channels of an image separately or together. 

2. **Morphological Transformations:** Morphological transformations are operations performed on binary images. They are used for removing noise, enhancing shapes, or smoothing out gradients. Common morphological operations include dilation, erosion, closing, and opening. Dilation expands bright spots, erosion shrinks dark regions. Closing fills in gaps between disconnected components and opening removes small holes inside large components. 

3. **Edge Detection:** Edge detection identifies discontinuity and boundaries in an image. It helps us identify objects and boundaries at different scales and orientations. There are three main edge detection approaches - Canny edge detector, Sobel operator, and Laplace Operator. All these methods use convolution filter to detect edges and provide gradient magnitude and orientation of edges. 

4. **Segmentation:** Segmentation separates an image into smaller meaningful parts. It is often done using clustering or classification techniques. Clustering methods divide the image into clusters of similar pixels and merge them to form segments. Classification methods try to assign each pixel to one class based on its visual features. Several segmentation algorithms exist such as watershed segmentation, graph cuts, region growing, and multi-label classification. 

These four basic algorithms cover the basic fundamentals of image processing. Of course, there are numerous other algorithms available for image processing ranging from pattern recognition to denoising and super-resolution. But these four fundamental ones constitute the building blocks for almost any image processing application.
