# 1.背景介绍


The Container network has been a crucial technology for years, with many companies now running containers as their main unit of deployment, providing agility, flexibility, and scalability to their IT environments. However, it also brings new challenges like increased security risks that need careful consideration before deployment. With the rapid evolution of container networking technologies over the last few years, there is a clear demand for professionals who are well-versed in both practical implementation and best practices. This article will explore various aspects of container networking and its security challenges and provide solutions using state-of-the-art technologies. We hope this guide provides valuable insights into how we can secure our containerized applications in today’s ever-evolving world of cloud native architectures.

In this article, we will briefly cover what Docker networking concepts such as bridge, overlay networks, etc., which allow us to communicate between multiple containers on different hosts or across multiple subnets, work in conjunction with Kubernetes CNI (Container Network Interface) plugins such as Flannel, Calico, etc., to establish network connectivity within clusters and beyond them, and finally, discuss some common pitfalls and vulnerabilities faced by developers when implementing these architectures. The second part of the article will go through various container security measures that should be implemented by system administrators, application owners, and platform providers to prevent unauthorized access, attacks, and data breaches within an enterprise environment. We will look at ways to enhance the overall security posture of organizations adopting container technologies, including multi-factor authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDPS), and logging and monitoring tools. Finally, we will touch upon several industry trends related to container networking and security that could influence future directions of research and development.

## 2.1 What is Container Networking?
Before diving deeper into the topic of container networking, let's first understand what a container network actually is. A container network refers to the software infrastructure used to connect and manage containers, allowing them to communicate with each other, and external networks. It usually involves several components such as Docker daemon, Linux kernel modules, IP routing tables, and firewall rules to achieve communication among containers and the outside world. 

There are three main types of container networks:

1. **Bridge Networks**: These networks use physical host interfaces and virtual switches to establish a direct connection between containers on the same host. They have low overhead and fast performance due to the fact that they bypass the networking stack of the container engine. 

2. **Overlay Networks**: These networks use encapsulation techniques to create isolated overlay networks over the underlying physical network infrastructure. Overlay networks enable higher levels of interoperability and scalability than traditional VLAN-based switching architectures. There are two primary overlay networks currently being used - **Swarm** and **Kubernetes**. 

3. **Host Networks**: Host networks provide direct network connectivity from containers to the underlying host machine. They are useful when you want to isolate containers but not require any isolation from the rest of the host operating system. 

## 2.2 Common Container Networking Technologies

Now, let's dive deep into the details of each type of container networking:

### 2.2.1 Bridge Networks

Bridge networks provide direct network connectivity between containers on the same host. Each bridge network creates a virtual switch inside the container engine, connected directly to one or more physical host interfaces. Containers attached to the same bridge network can communicate directly without going through the virtual network stack. 

However, since bridge networks share the same hardware resources (i.e., CPU, memory, and network bandwidth), care must be taken to ensure that resource usage does not exceed limits defined by either end. Additionally, managing large numbers of bridges can quickly become tedious and complex, leading to poor utilization of available computing resources.

### 2.2.2 Overlay Networks

An overlay network uses encapsulation techniques to create a single logical network spanning multiple underlying networks. Encapsulation allows messages to be routed independently of the protocol and destination address, making it easier to implement and maintain complex topologies. Examples of commonly used overlay networks include VXLAN, Geneve, GRE, L2TPv3, and IPIP tunnels.

When creating an overlay network, we need to decide whether it is global or local. Global overlay networks span all nodes within an organization and may involve a combination of public and private networks. Local overlay networks operate only within a particular cluster and are typically based on SDN (software defined networking) principles, meaning they rely on automated configuration management and are highly dynamic and resilient.

Some key features of overlay networks include automatic routing, multihoming, multiplexing, encryption, and seamless failover. However, overlay networks can be less secure compared to standard TCP/IP networks because they expose the entire underlying network topology. Furthermore, they may introduce additional latency due to the additional processing required to encapsulate and decapsulate packets.

### 2.2.3 Host Networks

Host networks provide direct network connectivity between containers and the underlying host machines. In contrast to most container networking options, host networks do not run inside the container engine itself, but rather are provided by the underlying operating system. Host networks provide better performance than bridge or overlay networks, especially when high-speed connectivity between containers is critical.

On the flip side, host networks may pose additional security risks if misconfigured or abused. For example, malicious users might exploit race conditions, buffer overflows, or Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to exhaust host resources or bring down the host. Additionally, compromising the underlying host requires compromising the entire VM guest OS, potentially exposing sensitive information and compromising other services running on the same host. 

Overall, while bridge and overlay networks provide convenient and efficient methods for connecting containers, they come with significant limitations and potential drawbacks. In addition to the issues discussed earlier, operators still face many challenges in deploying, configuring, and maintaining container networks. Therefore, it is essential for organizations to invest heavily in building robust and reliable container platforms that are designed to meet specific needs and constraints of the business.
