# 1.背景介绍


The Great Depression (also known as the Gulf War) was a period of economic uncertainty and depression in the United States from December 1929 to March 1933. It is often referred to as "the worst economic crisis in US history," after World War II. The term "Great" comes from the scale of its devastating damages on industry, manufacturing and transportation sectors that saw unprecedented losses in both revenue and profit margins during this crisis. The name stems from the fact that it was felt by most Americans as being an enormous failure caused by political instability and widespread prejudice against the country's Democratic leader, <NAME>. 

In order to understand why American families were suddenly so poor during the Great Depression, we need to know more about how the stock market reacted during this time. In particular, we will focus on three main factors:

1. Unemployment rate declined sharply during the Depression. In other words, people who had been working lost their jobs faster than those who had not been. This meant fewer workers were available for employment, which increased demand for goods and services, leading to rising prices.

2. The Fed and Federal Reserve monetarily supported industries through inflation easing. However, this support ended with the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates back to levels seen in the early part of the century due to monetary panic.

3. Boom-and-bust economics led to economies based in recovery rather than the usual boom phases where prosperity quickly disappears or fades away. During the Depression, economists assumed that these cycles would continue until new economic reforms like deregulation were implemented at a slower pace.

These are just some of the key factors contributing to the low level of life expectancy experienced by American families during the Depression, but they do not fully explain why they became poor while others remained rich. These findings implicate policies such as education, healthcare, infrastructure development, trade restrictions, and labor rights on a range of issues, including job security, income distribution, wages, housing conditions, and mortgage financing. We can examine each factor in turn to determine what could have contributed to the changing dynamics between poorer and richer households.

Let’s now dive deeper into the concept of business cycle theory and model it using mathematical equations. Business cycle theory suggests that economic activity has two clear stages - expansion and recession. As long as capital is in excess of demand, there is expansion; if it falls below demand, then recession ensues. There are various models proposed to describe these two stages, but one common one is the structural growth model, also known as the Keynesian model.

The Keynesian model assumes that a central bank sets interest rates and controls inflation, while individuals decide whether to invest and borrow money to stimulate economic activity. At any given point, individual decisions affect aggregate economic output, which follows government policies that set taxes, interest rates, and the degree to which savings generate income. If economic activity increases above demand, consumers begin buying more goods and services at higher prices, raising demand for them. On the other hand, if consumption falls below supply, banks increase interest rates and reduce lending, resulting in falling prices and lower demand. Consequently, business cycles alternate between recessions and expansions. 

Using the structural growth model, we can predict how the economy may behave under different scenarios, depending on changes in macroeconomic variables such as GDP per capita, inflation, unemployment rate, real interest rates, and production function parameters. By examining patterns over time, we can identify potential reasons behind such cycles and hypothesize about possible solutions.
