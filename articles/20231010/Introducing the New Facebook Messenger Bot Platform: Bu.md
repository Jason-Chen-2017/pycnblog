# 1.背景介绍


With the advent of social media platforms like Facebook, there has been a resurgence in the creation of chatbots to interact with users on these platforms. These bots are often built using natural language processing (NLP) tools that enable them to understand human speech and make responses that can be easily understood by humans as well. However, building such complex systems requires expertise in machine learning algorithms, NLP techniques, deep neural networks, and other technologies. 

Facebook recently launched their new messaging platform called Facebook Messenger, which offers a simple way for developers to create and manage chatbots within its platform. The platform also provides integration support with several third-party services like Google Cloud Natural Language API, which enables developers to leverage advanced NLP features from cloud providers.

In this blog post, we will introduce you to the new Facebook Messenger bot platform, provide an overview of how it works, discuss some core concepts and explain the underlying technology stack used for developing the system, and walk through step-by-step instructions for creating your first messenger bot using Dialogflow and AWS Lambda functions. We hope that by the end of this article, you will have learned enough about how to build effective chatbots using the latest Facebook Messenger platform and gain practical experience in deploying your own applications.


# 2. Core Concepts and Contact
Before diving into the details of building a chatbot using the latest Facebook Messenger platform, let's briefly go over some key concepts and terms related to the platform:

1. **Messenger**: This is the name given to the Facebook instant messaging application available on iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and macOS devices. It allows users to send and receive messages, as well as initiate conversations or add bots as friends. 

2. **Webhook**: A webhook is a type of HTTP callback that sends data to a designated endpoint when certain events occur within a particular app. In our case, we use webhooks to notify external services of user interactions with our chatbots. For example, whenever a user message is sent to one of our bots, we need to trigger an event in order for the external service to handle the request. 

3. **Page Access Token**: An access token used to authenticate requests made to the Graph API and Messenger API. Each page has a unique Page Access Token that needs to be kept secure. It cannot be shared publicly. 

4. **User ID**: This is a unique identifier assigned to each individual user who uses the Messenger application. It is generated based on various factors including device information, location data, and age. Users may change this identifier at any time if they wish. 

5. **Message**: This is the basic unit of communication within the Messenger platform. Users can text, image, video, audio, file, quick replies, buttons, or templates. 

6. **Thread**: This refers to the conversation between two or more people happening within the context of a specific group, room, or channel. Each thread has a unique thread_id that identifies it unambiguously. Threads may contain multiple messages depending on whether the conversation is still ongoing or ended. 


Now that we've covered some basics, let's move on to the core technology behind the Facebook Messenger bot platform - Dialogflow.

# 3. Technology Stack Overview
The new Facebook Messenger bot platform integrates closely with Dialogflow, a conversational AI platform developed by Google. Here's what makes up the tech stack:

1. **Dialogflow**: Dialogflow is an artificial intelligence (AI) platform designed specifically for conversational apps that require natural language understanding capabilities. It provides powerful dialog modeling capabilities alongside integration support with popular NLP frameworks like TensorFlow and Apache Spark. Developers can quickly build intent models that map user inputs to predefined actions, and Dialogflow takes care of the rest. The output of the model can then be presented back to the user as text, card, carousel, or list formats. 

2. **AWS**: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most trusted cloud provider, hosting many high-scale industry-leading services including storage, compute, database, analytics, machine learning, and security. Within the Messenger bot development ecosystem, we utilize AWS Lambda functions to host the code for our chatbots. AWS Lambda functions allow us to run custom code without worrying about infrastructure management, scaling, or server maintenance. They also come with built-in auto-scaling capabilities, making it easy to scale up or down depending on demand.  

3. **API Gateway**: AWS API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. It acts as a proxy layer between clients and backend microservices, enabling them to connect seamlessly across different environments, stages, and regions. By integrating with API Gateway, we can expose our lambda functions as RESTful endpoints that can accept incoming HTTP requests from Messenger. When a user sends a message to one of our chatbots, we'll forward the request to the appropriate Lambda function using API Gateway.  

Let's dive deeper into each of these components in more detail.
