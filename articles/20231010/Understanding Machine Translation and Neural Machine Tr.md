# 1.背景介绍


Machine translation (MT) is a sub-field of natural language processing that involves the automatic conversion of text from one human language to another. The goal of MT is to enable machines to understand and communicate with humans in different languages. It has several applications such as speech recognition, mobile phone messaging, online chatbots, document translation, information retrieval, etc. 

However, it remains an under-explored topic among researchers and developers because of its complexity and ambiguity. In this article, we will discuss about machine translation systems and their underlying techniques. We will first focus on the traditional statistical machine translation technique called phrase-based statistical machine translation (PB-SMT). Then, we will move on to neural machine translation (NMT), which stands for neural network based MT. We will go through various models used in NMT, including sequence-to-sequence, transformer, encoder-decoder architecture, etc., and finally we will conclude our analysis by comparing these two approaches.

## Phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (PB-SMT): 
The core concept behind PB-SMT is using parallel corpora to build a translation model that can accurately translate any given sentence from source language into target language without relying on complex linguistic features or phonology rules. This approach does not require any deep learning algorithms but rather relies on handcrafted lexical, syntactic, and semantic rules to generate translations.


In traditional SMT, each word in the input sentence is mapped to a corresponding word in the output sentence. However, in PB-SMT, words are grouped together into phrases before being translated. These phrases include nouns, verbs, adjectives, prepositions, pronouns, conjunctions, numbers, and other grammatical units. Thus, a group of related words is assigned to a single representation during training. For example, "the cat" would be represented as "the+cat". Similarly, "in order to eat" would also be represented as "in+order+to+eat". As a result, there is lesser chance of generating wrong translations due to variations between individual words.

To perform inference, the system scans the source sentence, extracts all possible phrases and assigns them probabilities according to their probability distributions learned during training. Finally, the highest probable combination of phrases is selected as the most likely translation.

## Neural Machine Translation (NMT): 
Neural networks have become increasingly popular for MT tasks owing to their ability to learn complex patterns from large amounts of data and provide accurate results when fed with new inputs. Therefore, NMT systems consist of an encoder-decoder framework where the encoder reads the source sentence and generates a fixed size vector representation of its meaning, while the decoder takes this encoded representation as input and outputs the target sentence in a manner that enables the model to make predictions close to reality.

There are three main types of NMT architectures:

1. Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq): A basic Seq2Seq model consists of two stacked recurrent neural networks (RNN) – an encoder and a decoder. The encoder processes the input sentence sequentially and produces a context vector containing information about the entire sentence. The decoder then uses the context vector to produce the predicted output sentence sequentially. The encoder-decoder model achieves good performance in many tasks like translation and speech recognition. 

2. Attention Mechanisms: Another important aspect of NMT systems is attention mechanism which helps the model focus on relevant parts of the input sentence at every step of decoding. In addition, transformers, which rely solely on self-attention mechanisms instead of recurrence, have shown promising results in numerous NLP tasks. Transformers combine the benefits of both RNNs and CNNs by avoiding sequential computation and allowing efficient parallelization of operations across multiple layers.   

3. Hierarchical Models: Some NMT systems use hierarchical models where high level representations are obtained from lower level ones. Examples include multilingual models that incorporate language specific components into the overall system.

Overall, NMT systems offer more robustness than state-of-the-art methods by leveraging advanced machine learning technologies. They allow us to handle more complex sentences and domains by learning from massive amounts of parallel data. Despite their recent success, they still face significant challenges such as limited resource availability, long training times, and low efficiency. Nevertheless, they are continuously evolving towards higher accuracy and efficiency levels.
