# 1.背景介绍


Knowledge graph (KG) is a popular concept in natural language processing and artificial intelligence that consists of a set of entities (nodes) and their relationships with other entities represented by triples (edges). KG can be used to model various real-world concepts such as people, organizations, and objects through relationships between them. Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE), on the other hand, is a technique that converts each entity and relation into numerical vectors that represent its semantic meaning. The goal of KGE is to learn efficient representations of these complex data structures from large datasets of triplets without requiring labeled examples or expensive manual annotation processes. Traditional approaches have mainly focused on transferring knowledge learned from one domain to another within an end-to-end training process. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning approach called Discourse Context Enhanced Transfer Learning (DCE) that enables us to transfer knowledge across different domains while taking into account explicit information contained in textual contexts. DCE incorporates discourse coherence signals obtained from linguistic analysis tools like sentiment analyzers, named entity recognition, part-of-speech taggers, and dependency parsers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DCE through experiments on two knowledge graph embeddings models namely TransE and RotatE.

## Knowledge Graph
A knowledge graph refers to a structured collection of entities and their associated attributes (e.g., names, descriptions, images, etc.) related to those entities via statements made about their relations. It is defined as a directed acyclic graph where nodes are entities and edges represent the relationship between them. 

Statements consist of subject–object pairs which denote the role played by the object in relation to the subject. For example: A person "Bob" works at company X. The statement expresses that Bob plays a certain role in relation to Company X.

The purpose of a knowledge graph is to provide a common framework for storing, organizing, querying, integrating, and analyzing large amounts of structured and unstructured data. KGs can capture rich knowledge from diverse sources such as text documents, databases, and social media. They enable us to address important problems in areas such as question answering, fact extraction, recommender systems, and decision support systems. Additionally, they are often used to train machine learning algorithms for a wide range of applications including predictive analytics, personalized recommendations, fraud detection, and customer behavior analysis.

## Knowledge Graph Embeddings
Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE) convert each entity and relation into numerical vectors that represent its semantic meaning. Each vector captures both the entity's properties and its relationships with other entities in the KG. It has been shown that embedding high-dimensional dense feature vectors based on sparse binary matrices leads to better performance than traditional matrix factorization methods in many applications, especially when dealing with very large datasets. Therefore, KGE has become a widely adopted methodology for representing and reasoning over KGs.

In the field of KGE, there exist several state-of-the-art embedding models such as TransE, ConvE, RESCAL, NTN, and DistMult. These models generate dense embeddings that capture the latent structure of the KG. However, these models do not take into account any external contextual information beyond the local neighborhood around individual entities. To improve the quality of the resulting embeddings, researchers have proposed multiple transfer learning strategies, such as domain adaptation, meta-learning, and semi-supervised learning, but none of them consider explicitly capturing the implicit semantics encoded in textual contexts.

Discourse Context Enhanced Transfer Learning (DCE) is a novel transfer learning approach that enables us to transfer knowledge across different domains while taking into account explicit information contained in textual contexts. This is achieved through the use of linguistic features extracted from the texts involved in the transfer process. Specifically, we extract sentiment polarity scores, syntactic dependencies, and named entity tags from the source and target texts respectively. We then employ transfer learning algorithms that leverage these features to further enhance the accuracy of our knowledge graph embeddings.

## Transfer learning
Transfer learning is a machine learning technique that allows a model to learn from an existing dataset and apply it to new tasks with limited labeled data available. By leveraging patterns and insights learned from a pre-trained task, transferred models can perform well on a new task, without needing to start from scratch. There are three main types of transfer learning: fine-tuning, multi-task learning, and distillation. Fine-tuning involves updating only some of the weights of a pre-trained model during the training process while keeping the remaining layers fixed, while multi-task learning involves jointly optimizing all parameters of a model to solve multiple tasks simultaneously, and finally, distillation involves using a small model (teacher) to transfer the knowledge learned from a larger model (student).

Transfer learning is commonly applied in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing, where we have access to vast amounts of annotated data but want to quickly develop accurate models on novel tasks. This makes transfer learning particularly useful in practical scenarios where labeled data is scarce or nonexistent, making it difficult or impossible to collect or annotate enough data to train a deep neural network from scratch. Instead, we can leverage patterns learned from a well-performing model trained on a similar task to help guide the training of a more specialized model on a new task.
