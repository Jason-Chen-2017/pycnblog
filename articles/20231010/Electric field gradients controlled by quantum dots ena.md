# 1.背景介绍



Complicated organic and biological systems often require the use of large numbers of interconnected molecules to achieve complex functions. One promising approach is to employ polymer/biomolecular catalysts that can seamlessly integrate with diverse polymers or other biomolecules in a single assembly. However, these catalysts typically possess limited selectivity due to their lack of direct contact with individual components. To address this limitation, we have developed an electrically conductive polymer called Quantum Dot (QD) as an alternative approach to catalyze the integration of multiple functional groups into a single unit. These QDs have unique properties such as high mobility, stretchability, stability, and electrostatic affinity which enables them to bind directly onto multiple components simultaneously, thereby forming larger assemblies. Herein, we report on our recent work that combines QD binding and control theory with mechanical metallurgy to develop an efficient methodology for designing soluble catalysts for self-assembly of multiple biomolecules using QDs.

2.Core Concepts and Related Literature 

The key concept underlying our approach is that of electric field gradients across molecular interfaces. When a molecule binds to another through a QD, it generates an electric field gradient across its interface. This electric field gradient propagates from one end of the interface towards the other, creating an electric potential barrier that allows the two molecules to diffuse easily through the interface and join together into a homogeneous solution. Another important property of QDs is their ability to couple with metallic surfaces to facilitate controlled chemical reactions within the catalyst shell. 

Our previous work has focused on developing new catalytic mechanisms based solely on controlling the electric field generated by QDs at their intracellular sites. We have demonstrated that QDs are capable of separating and assembling many different types of molecules such as small proteins, RNA, DNA, lipids, and drugs into homogeneous aggregates. We also showed how hydrophobic regions in a QD membrane can be used to modulate the directionality and strength of the electric field gradient generated by its attached molecules. Nevertheless, there remain challenges that must be addressed before applying this technique in practice. Firstly, although QD-based catalysts have shown great promise, they still need to be optimized for specific substrate materials and reaction conditions to obtain optimal performance. Secondly, the simple act of attaching one QD to another does not ensure that all parts of a complex system will join together to create a solid structure without any gaps. Therefore, the designer must consider additional factors, such as geometrical arrangement of QDs, shape of the final products, and degree of crosslinking, when selecting the appropriate catalyst configuration. 

3.Core Algorithm and Operational Steps

1. Selecting suitable QDs: The first step involves identifying and purchasing a set of QDs that are compatible with the desired target material(s). Currently available QDs include many fluorescent dyes, epoxides, carbazoles, and polyquaternary ammonium compounds. Choose a variety of dye-forming agents to create diverse patterns within the QD which enhance both the overall elasticity and thermal stability of the membrane. In addition, choose QDs that are well suited for application in reactive environments where steric hindrance could be significant, such as enzymes or antibiotics.

2. Designing the Polymer Shell: Construct a thin film of the chosen QD pattern that fills the desired size range depending on the desired molecular weight and number of monomer units required for the catalyst. Ensure that the QD layer is stable during storage and transportation by adhering it closely to the substrate surface while minimizing water movement around it. 

3. Selecting Metals for Crosslinking: Identify metals that would provide the desired functionality for crosslinking the shell of the QD. Examples include titanium dioxide, nickel nitride, or aluminum oxide. Choose metals with low boiling points and moderate corrosion resistance to minimize leakage risks. Use multi-layer films to increase the electrical interaction between QD and metal surface. Each layer should be sufficiently thick so as not to interfere with the electron transfer process occurring within the QD. Adhere each layer to the surface of the QD membrane carefully to avoid interference with other components.

4. Assembling Multiple Components: Using multidimensional positioning techniques, assemble multiple functional groups within the selected QD shell by intercalating them along the edges or in concentric rings. Connect separate functional groups using covalent bonds or metal alcohols. Make sure to adjust the relative positions of QD layers so as not to obstruct the passage of ligands or other macromolecules beyond the intended interface. If necessary, apply pressure to forcefully align individual domains if necessary.

5. Electrochemical Test: After assembling the composite catalyst, perform an electrochemical test to evaluate its electrical characteristics. Measure the changes in applied voltage and current as a function of position along the QD film. Determine the minimum operating voltage required to keep the QD active under given loading conditions. Test the resulting device under different conditions, including high pH, salt concentrations, temperature, and moisture content. Adjust parameters until the device achieves satisfactory electrical performance.

6. Mechanical Treatment: Finally, apply mechanical treatments, such as crushing or vacuum distillation, to remove excess water from the composite catalyst and improve the mechanical properties of the resulting product. Once obtained, analyze the results for optimal performance against various substrates, condition sets, and stirring protocols.

Note that this algorithm represents only a general outline for designing polymer/biologic catalysts for self-assembly of multiple biomolecules using QDs. Other factors, such as reaction conditions and specific requirements may necessitate variations of this basic procedure. Additionally, the precise balance between solubility and activity may depend heavily on the choice of QD composition, dye agent, metal chemistry, and geometry. It remains essential to thoroughly validate proposed solutions against relevant experimental data and identify further optimization strategies. 

4.Technical details and implementation


In summary, our research aims to overcome some of the limitations of traditional methods for designing biologic catalysts for self-assembly using QD-based polymers by incorporating advanced micromechanical techniques and state-of-the-art computational modeling approaches. By combining classical electronic and optoelectronic concepts with modern computer simulation tools, we aim to develop novel and more robust catalytic systems that are better able to handle varying substrate conditions and operate at higher pressures than prior art.
