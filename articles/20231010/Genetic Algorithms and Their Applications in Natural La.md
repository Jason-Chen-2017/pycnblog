# 1.背景介绍


Genetic algorithms (GAs) are popular metaheuristic optimization techniques used for solving complex optimization problems such as global optimization or scheduling problems. In recent years, GAs have become increasingly popular due to their efficiency in solving problems that were previously considered impractical or impossible using traditional methods. This is particularly true for natural language processing tasks, where the large size of data sets requires a significant amount of computational resources to process them efficiently. The goal of this article is to provide an introduction to genetic algorithms and their applications in natural language processing, specifically those involving text classification.
Natural language processing (NLP) involves analyzing and understanding human languages by extracting relevant information from unstructured text sources. One common task within NLP is text classification, which aims at categorizing documents into different classes based on the content of their words and phrases. Traditional machine learning approaches typically use feature extraction methods like bag-of-words or word embeddings to represent input texts and train supervised models using labeled data sets. However, these methods do not always work well when dealing with large data sets or highly imbalanced class distributions. Hence, researchers and developers have been looking for new ways to improve performance without relying too much on handcrafted features or training long and expensive models.
Increasing amounts of available data and computation power have led to the development of many advanced GAs methods. These include population-based methods, differential evolution, particle swarm optimization, and other variants. Population-based methods apply random selection and crossover operations between individuals to generate offspring solutions, similar to how nature works. Differential evolution is inspired by biological mechanisms and tries to mimic the genetics of heritable traits through mutation and recombination. Particle swarm optimization optimizes search spaces in multidimensional spaces using local interactions among particles. Despite their popularity, none of these methods have been applied directly to NLP tasks, mainly because they rely on features extracted from raw text inputs, which can be noisy and sensitive to the underlying structure and semantics of the language being processed. Therefore, we will discuss several state-of-the-art methods and techniques for text classification using GAs.

## Introduction
Text classification refers to assigning predefined categories to a given document based on its contents. The most commonly used approach for text classification is naive Bayes algorithm, which calculates the probability of each category given the presence or absence of certain keywords or n-grams in the document. Although naive Bayes performs well on small datasets, it is not scalable and does not consider the contextual relationships between words. Another widely used method is support vector machines (SVMs), which learn a linear decision boundary to separate data points into different classes. SVMs require careful preprocessing of the input data and tuning parameters to achieve good accuracy. More recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a powerful alternative to both Naive Bayes and SVMs. They are capable of handling high dimensional input vectors and extract effective features automatically from the raw text inputs, making them ideal candidates for NLP tasks. Nevertheless, DNNs still suffer from issues such as overfitting, slow convergence, and lack of interpretability. To address these challenges, various GAs algorithms have been proposed to optimize the parameters of DNNs and improve their generalization ability. Among all these methods, population-based methods such as particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, and asynchronous parallel tempering are currently the most popular ones for NLP tasks. We will focus our attention on these three techniques in detail.

 ## Terminology
Before diving into the details of GAs, let's briefly define some key terms that we need to understand:

**Individual:** An individual in GA represents one solution to the problem space. It consists of multiple genes which are represented by binary values, usually {0, 1}. Each gene corresponds to a variable in the problem space. For example, in the text classification scenario, an individual may consist of boolean variables indicating whether a specific keyword appears in the document. There can also be additional information stored in the individual such as fitness value or age.

**Population:** A set of individuals, called the population, represents the current candidate solutions to the problem space. During the course of the GA process, the best performing individuals move to the next generation while others undergo mutations and crosses over to create new offspring. At any point in time, there are two main components of a population: active and inactive individuals. Active individuals are those whose corresponding fitness function has been evaluated yet. Inactive individuals remain in the population but are temporarily ignored during the selection process. New individuals are generated by combining existing individuals according to selected operators.

**Parent Selection:** Parent selection determines the way in which parents are chosen from the current population. Two types of parent selection strategies are commonly employed - elitism and roulette wheel. Elitism selects the top performing individuals from the previous generation to ensure that their contributions make it onto the next generation. Roulette wheel selects parents randomly based on their fitness scores so that more fit individuals are likely to be selected more frequently than less fit individuals. Other variations exist including tournament selection and deterministic ranking selection.

**Crossover Operator:** Crossover operator combines the genetic material of two parent individuals to produce new offspring individuals. Crossover is performed at a single locus along the chromosome, producing two new haplotypes that occupy alternating regions of the chromosome. Common crossover operators include uniform crossover, one-point crossover, and multi-point crossover.

**Mutation Operator:** Mutation operator modifies the genetic material of an individual, often introducing changes that increase the diversity of the population. Common mutation operators include bit flip, swap, scramble, insertions and deletions.

**Fitness Function:** Fitness function measures the quality of an individual’s representation of the problem space. Higher fitness values indicate better representations. For text classification, fitness functions typically measure the likelihood that an individual correctly assigns the correct category to the input text. Several fitness evaluation metrics can be used depending on the application. Some examples include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, there are hybrid fitness functions that combine multiple criteria together.

### Genetic Programming
#### What is Genetic Programming?

The key concept in genetic programming is the concept of the `primitive` operation, which defines the base building blocks of the program. These primitives could be mathematical functions such as addition, multiplication, or comparison, logical operators, etc., or simply terminal symbols representing constants or variables. When executing a program tree, the interpreter starts at the root node and evaluates each child node sequentially until the final result is obtained. By exploiting the hierarchical structure of program trees and expressiveness of primitive operations, genetic programming enables us to find optimized programs that solve a wide range of problems.

#### Why Use Genetic Programming for Text Classification?
One advantage of genetic programming is that it can effectively handle non-convex problems with complicated constraints. Non-convex problems occur when there are multiple optimal solutions to a problem, leading to multiple minimizers instead of just one global optimum. As an example, consider the following problem: Given a list of numbers, determine the smallest possible sum of any contiguous subset of the list that satisfies a certain condition. One possible solution would be adding up every pair of adjacent elements until the condition is satisfied. However, another solution could involve skipping over pairs of elements to reduce the number of additions needed. Thus, neither solution is strictly better than the other. Without knowledge of the conditional constraint, conventional optimization methods such as gradient descent cannot solve this kind of problem, since they only look for the minimum of a scalar function that maps the entire domain to a single output. 

By using genetic programming to model the relationship between programs and the target phenomenon, we can obtain optimal solutions even in cases where there are multiple minimizers. Furthermore, GP is able to deal with non-linearities present in real-world problems and exploit spatial correlations between variables by encoding dependencies between operators and variables. Overall, GP provides an efficient framework for finding optimized solutions to a wide variety of problems by leveraging the properties of genetic variation.
