# 1.背景介绍


Color Enhancement or Color Correction is the process of adjusting an image’s color balance so that it becomes more visually appealing and easier to understand for the human eye. It helps in improving image quality by reducing chromatic aberrations and shadows while preserving the original content. However, achieving high-quality color correction on dark images remains a challenge due to its low contrast between foreground objects and background, which can be seen as one of the primary challenges of this task. In recent years, several researchers have proposed different algorithms for automated color correction of dark images based on computer vision techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNN) and machine learning methods. Although these methods are efficient, they still require expertise from the color science and image processing communities. Thus, there is still much room for improvement towards automating the entire process. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning approach called DEEPCCN for automated color enhancement of dark images using CNNs. We also discuss how our method compares with state-of-the-art techniques used for similar tasks and highlight areas for further research. Finally, we provide a detailed step-by-step implementation of our algorithm using Python and OpenCV library.

Before we dive into the technical details, let's first recall some basic concepts related to color enhancement. 

1. Chromaticity: The term “chromaticity” refers to the relationship between the colors of light falling onto a surface under different spectral wavelengths. This characteristic is used to calculate various color attributes such as hue, saturation, value, luminance etc., which play a crucial role in perception and interpretation of visual information.

2. Hue: The hue of a color represents the dominant wavelength component of the visible spectrum of the color and ranges from blue (violet), green (cyan), yellow (orange), red (red) to purple (magenta). A color with no hue means gray scale or black/white.

3. Saturation: Saturation indicates the purity of the color. When the color is saturated, it has full intensity everywhere and almost no white or black points. When the color is desaturated, it has dimmer portions along certain regions and brighter sections elsewhere. Saturated colors generally have higher contrast than desaturated ones.

4. Value: Value represents the brightness or lightness of the color. Light colored items usually appear brighter compared to medium or dark items. The level of illumination or exposure required to achieve specific levels of value depends on the way each individual pixel is exposed to light.

5. Luma (or YUV): The Luma channel or YUV channels represent the relative intensities of the three primary RGB components or two Y'CbCr planes respectively. These values vary from 0 to 255, where zero corresponds to a black or nearly black color and 255 corresponds to the highest possible intensity. They help us identify whether the image is bright or dark without having to analyze the actual color distribution. Therefore, we need to estimate the amount of luma present in each pixel of the input image before applying any color adjustment technique.

6. Deuteranomaly and Protanomaly: Both deuteranomaly and protanomaly are types of color blindness. Both disorders affect people who are predisposed to suffer them. In both cases, some of the receptors in the retina become weak and unable to respond effectively to color differences caused by the uneven concentration of cones in the retinal illuminators.

7. Dullness or Straw-man Effect: This effect occurs when an artist applies a filter or jewelry that reduces the contrast between colors or even replaces some colors altogether, resulting in distorted views of the image. If not detected early enough, straw-man effects may cause severe damage to the image quality.

Now that we have a good understanding of the basic concepts, let's move on to discussing about the key features of our DEEPCCN algorithm. 

1. Automatic Estimation of the Input Image’s Luma: Our method uses the mean absolute deviation (MAD) function to automatically estimate the luma value of each pixel in the input image. MAD measures the difference between a pixel’s true value and the median value of all pixels in the image. By calculating the MAD for every pixel, we obtain a histogram of luma values. Based on the distribution of luma values, we determine if the input image is likely to be bright or dark.

2. Automatic Segmentation of Objects and Background: Since most color enhancements involve correcting the tone of an image, we must segment the objects and their corresponding background. We use a combination of segmentation models, namely thresholding and clustering, to segment the objects and background separately.

3. Model Training: Before training the model, we preprocess the data by performing normalization and resizing operations to reduce computation time. Then we feed the preprocessed data to the network architecture consisting of multiple convolution layers, pooling layers, dropout layers, and fully connected layers. During training, we optimize the parameters of the network using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization algorithm and backpropagation through time (BPTT). After training, we evaluate the performance of the network using metrics like Mean Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).

4. Pixelwise Adaptation of Color Balance: Once we have trained the network, we apply it pixelwise to each pixel in the input image. For each pixel, we predict the new luma value using the learned weights of the network. Using the predicted luma value, we generate separate weighted averages for the R, G, and B color channels. Each of these weighted averages is then subtracted from the original pixel value to obtain the enhanced pixel value. This process continues until all pixels have been processed.

5. Postprocessing Techniques: To eliminate artifacts introduced during color balancing, we perform denoising and smoothing operations after the adaptation phase. Additionally, we introduce adaptive gamma correction to address the problem of color inconsistency across an image. Lastly, we handle potential color blindness issues using automatic detection and correction mechanisms. Overall, our DEEPCCN algorithm takes advantage of advanced computer vision techniques and transfer learning approaches to automatically improve the appearance of dark images.

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
To better understand the working of DEEPCCN, let's take a closer look at the fundamental principles behind it.

## Automatic Luma Estimation
Our algorithm estimates the input image's luma value automatically by computing the MAD metric for every pixel. Specifically, for each pixel, we compute the distance between its true luma value and the median luma value of all pixels in the image. We then normalize this distance by dividing it by half the maximum allowed deviation of the luma range (i.e., 255 divided by sqrt(3)). Intuitively, small distances correspond to pixels with similar luma values, whereas larger distances indicate pixels with significantly lower or higher luma values. By averaging the normalized distances over all pixels, we obtain a histogram of luma values that can be used to infer the ambient lighting conditions of the input image. The figure below shows the concept of the MAD metric applied to a sample image.


We train a deep neural network to learn a mapping from input images to luma histograms. Specifically, given an input image, the network outputs a vector representing the frequency of occurrence of each luma value in the output histogram. We minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted histogram and the target histogram, using backpropagation through time (BPTT) for efficient parameter updates. At test time, we simply pass the input image through the network to get the estimated luma histogram. Note that since the MAD metric computes the relative distance between a pixel's luma value and the median value of all other pixels in the image, it does not distinguish between highly saturated colors and mid-tones. Hence, it cannot be directly applied to naturalistic datasets and will likely produce biased results for those scenarios. Nonetheless, it serves as a starting point for building effective color correction systems and provides a solid foundation for further improvements.

## Object and Background Segmentation
Our algorithm segments the object and background of the input image by combining a series of segmentation models. We start by binarizing the image using Otsu's method, which finds the optimal threshold separating foreground and background pixels based on their histogram. Next, we cluster the remaining foreground pixels into groups of similar colors using k-means clustering, which splits the dataset into K distinct clusters. We select the cluster with the largest number of pixels as the foreground group and assign all other pixels to the background class. We repeat this process until convergence or a fixed number of iterations is reached. Depending on the complexity of the scene and available computational resources, we can choose appropriate numbers of clusters and iterations. While simple, this approach works well for many real-world scenes and is easy to implement. Moreover, it implicitly enforces spatial constraints among adjacent pixels, which might lead to suboptimal results for complex scenes with strong texture variations.

## Network Architecture
Our main contribution lies in developing a deep learning framework for color enhancement that combines the advantages of feature learning and end-to-end training. We use a customizable architecture that consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling and nonlinear activation functions. We use residual connections and batch normalizations to ensure that gradients flow smoothly throughout the network. The final layer contains only a single neuron for each color channel, allowing us to map the image space to the color space. Given the dynamic range of color values, we apply sigmoid activation instead of linear units to ensure that the result stays within the valid range. By carefully selecting hyperparameters such as kernel sizes, strides, and padding, we can design networks that are robust against noise, fine-grained detail, and missing elements.

In summary, our network architecture involves the following steps:

1. Preprocess the input image by scaling, cropping, and normalizing it.
2. Apply a series of convolutional layers with non-linear activations and pooling layers to extract local features.
3. Add skip connections and batch norm to prevent vanishing gradients and stabilize the training process.
4. Map the extracted features to the color space using multiple fully connected layers with sigmoid activation.
5. Predict the luma value of each pixel by multiplying the estimated RGB coefficients with the corresponding luma channel.
6. Generate separate weighted averages for the R, G, and B color channels.
7. Subtract the generated weighted averages from the original pixel values to obtain the enhanced pixel values.

## Postprocessing Techniques
After adapting the color balance of each pixel individually, our algorithm includes a variety of post-processing techniques to remove artifacts and enhance the overall quality of the enhanced image. First, we perform denoising by Gaussian filtering and smoothing to remove the blurring effect caused by the multiple passes of the algorithm. Second, we add adaptive gamma correction to make the corrected image look consistent across an image. Third, we detect and correct any potential color blindness issues using advanced statistical methods and built-in correction rules. Fourth, we allow users to manually control the degree of adjustment using a sliders interface. Overall, these techniques contribute to making the algorithm more user-friendly and reliable.
