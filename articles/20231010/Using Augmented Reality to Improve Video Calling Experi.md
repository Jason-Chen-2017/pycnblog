# 1.背景介绍


Augmented Reality(增强现实) refers to a technology that combines computer-generated imagery with real-world elements such as objects and environments in order to provide users with additional information or enhanced experiences within the context of traditional visual displays. The idea behind using this technology for video conferencing is to enhance communication between remote participants by adding virtual objects into the environment where they are being shown. This way, viewers can interact with these objects and feel part of the conversation through their physical presence in the room. With the help of AR, we can create immersive VR (Virtual Reality) experiences that integrate natural and human interactions while also providing an engaging and interactive experience for the audience members. 

In recent years, augmented reality has become more popular due to its versatility, efficiency and effectiveness. Some leading companies have been investing in developing advanced technologies related to this field, including Facebook’s Oculus Quest 2 headset which allows users to explore digital worlds in a new dimension through high fidelity visualizations and interfaces. Additionally, Apple’s ARKit framework allows developers to build applications capable of creating augmented reality content on iOS devices. Among various other applications, companies like Amazon have started using augmented reality in various fields like gaming, medicine, manufacturing, retail etc.


However, there are several challenges associated with the use of augmented reality in video calling platforms. One challenge is the potential impact it could have on user privacy. Since social media platforms collect personal data from online users every day, it becomes essential to ensure that the collected data does not violate any ethical guidelines set forth by regulators or organizations. Another issue is the need for appropriate precautions during video calls to prevent people from accidentally interacting with the augmented reality objects placed around them. It is also important to protect the physical safety of all participants involved in a call by using face masks and maintaining good hygiene practices. 

To overcome these challenges, many companies are exploring ways to improve the quality of video conferencing sessions even when AR is used. Some of the promising solutions include: 

1. Remote visualization techniques: These involve using specialized hardware or software that enables users to view the surroundings without actually standing next to another participant. The goal is to reduce eye strain and increase attention span of both parties. Examples of such systems include Google Meet Stick which uses projectors to simulate the floor plan of a large meeting space. Other examples include Microsoft Teams’ VDI feature, where users can connect remotely via a virtual desktop interface without requiring physical presence in the same space.

2. Continuous monitoring: Instead of stopping at one location, continuous monitoring involves capturing multiple frames of the same scene and updating them in real-time based on actions taken by participants. In this approach, viewers can see how the conversations are unfolding in real time, making it easier to identify moments of disruption or anger among participants. 

3. Privacy awareness training: It is crucial to educate participants about the risks of exposing themselves to the risk of having their videos monitored remotely and provide proper guidance and best practices. For example, companies like Zoom provide warning messages before a scheduled video call to inform the participants about the possibility of monitoring and ask them to turn off camera/microphone if needed. Furthermore, some smart glasses offer eye protection features that allow users to protect themselves from accidental viewing of AR objects.

4. Social distancing protocol: Even though face mask usage may seem safe today, stigma associated with COVID-19 and subsequent lockdowns make it necessary to take measures to maintain social distancing among remote participants. Companies like Skype recently introduced a new feature called “ghost mode” that automatically turns off the microphone and camera if two or more participants get too close together. While this technique helps to keep everyone physically apart, it creates the risk of potentially alienating those who want to talk with each other outside the confines of the physical space. To address this problem, companies like Slack have created workspaces where participants can collaborate remotely virtually without worrying about getting physically close to others.
