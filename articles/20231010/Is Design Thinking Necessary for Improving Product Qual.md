# 1.背景介绍


Design Thinking is a methodology and framework that encourages innovation through collaborative problem-solving and iterative design processes. It was originally developed by IBM’s Psychology Department to address the need for organizations to improve customer experience while delivering products and services within given timeframes. 

Facebook Messenger is one of the most popular social media messaging apps available today with over a million monthly active users (MAU) and counting. The product quality varies across different regions worldwide due to its global reach. However, there has been little research about whether Design Thinking can help improving the quality of Facebook Messenger. This study aims to identify key factors related to product quality in terms of usability, efficiency, and engagement among Facebook Messenger users and compare their effectiveness using an approach based on Design Thinking methods.

Key concepts:

1. Usability – measures how easy it is to use a product or service.

2. Efficiency – measures the speed at which a task can be completed without errors or delay.

3. Engagement - measures user satisfaction, interest, and loyalty. 

4. Individual differences - represent unconscious cognitive biases and preferences that influence human behavior. For instance, age effects preference towards technology over traditional means of communication.

Together, these three dimensions contribute to the overall quality of a product. Using Design Thinking methodology, we will conduct a series of interviews with individuals who regularly use Facebook Messenger and observe them during a 90-minute period. During this process, participants will complete brief surveys before and after their daily usage session as well as reflect on their experiences. We will collect data on various metrics including usability, efficiency, and engagement along with individual differences like gender, age, occupation etc. Finally, we will analyze the collected data and apply statistical models to generate insights into the relationship between product quality and various demographic factors such as gender, age, income bracket, and education level. Based on our findings, we will suggest ways to make changes to the product to improve the overall quality.

We will use the following steps to conduct this study:

1. Conduct Interviews

   Before beginning the survey, I will provide general instructions to participants on what they should do when asked to participate in the study. These guidelines will ensure fairness and consistency in the results. I will also explain my plan for data collection, including the purpose of each question and specific procedures for answering them. 
   
   Once I have received consent from all participants, I will start by inviting them to join me virtually via Google Hangouts or Skype. I will ask them to sign up for the app if they haven't already done so. I will then conduct six 90-minute sessions where I will observe them during their day-to-day usage of Messenger. In each session, I will guide them through navigating the interface, completing surveys, and reflecting on their interactions.
   
 2. Data Collection

   Each participant will fill out two separate surveys: a preliminary survey and a post-session survey.
   
   Preliminary Survey:
   
   Question|Answer 
   -------|------------
   1.|How familiar are you with Facebook Messenger and its features?|A1. Not familiar at all |A2. Familiar but not expert |A3. Expert but not proficient |A4. Very experienced 
   2.|What kind of content would you like to receive?|B1. Text messages only |B2. Images and videos |B3. Links and files |B4. Shortcuts and suggested chats 
   3.|Do you tend to text quickly or slowly?|C1. Slowly |C2. Quickly 
   4.|Do you prefer sending personal messages or group chats more often?|D1. Personal messages more often |D2. Group chats more often 
   5.|Would you like your personal information deleted once the survey is complete?|E1. Yes, please delete my information |E2. No thanks, keep my information 
   6.|How willing are you to share feedback on this study?|F1. Very interested |F2. Somewhat interested |F3. Not interested at all 
   7.|Are you comfortable discussing any concerns or ideas with me privately after the session?|G1. Of course, I am happy to discuss them |G2. No, I understand privacy is important 
   
   Post-Session Survey:
   
   Question|Answer 
   -------|------------
   1.|Was the conversation helpful?|H1. Yes, it was very helpful |H2. Sometimes it was difficult |H3. Never really had a positive outcome 
   2.|Did the interface respond instantly?|I1. Always responsive |I2. Occasionally laggy |I3. Never responsive at all 
   3.|Do you think the software needs improvement?|J1. Absolutely! Please let me know how |J2. Perhaps some minor improvements could be made |J3. No, everything looks great 
   4.|What is your preferred contact number?|K1. My phone number is listed below |K2. Any other way to get in touch is fine too
  
  To measure usability and efficiency, we will track the number of messages sent per minute, number of likes/comments received per minute, response time of messages, frequency of adding contacts, total duration of calls, and turnaround times for orders placed. Additionally, we will capture feedback and suggestions provided by participants regarding the software.

 3. Statistical Analysis
  
   After collecting the data from all participants, I will combine the responses into a single dataset and perform descriptive statistics to summarize the data. I will calculate the mean value, median value, mode value, range, variance, standard deviation, quartile values, correlation coefficients, and regression analysis using appropriate mathematical formulas. 
 
   I will first check for normality assumption using Shapiro-Wilk test. If p-value < 0.05, the distribution is not normally distributed and we cannot assume normality of the data. Otherwise, we can proceed to perform hypothesis testing. 
 
   Then, I will check if there is any significant difference between groups using t-test, ANOVA, or MANCOVA tests. If the null hypothesis is rejected, it suggests that the population means of the selected independent variable(s) are significantly different than those of the reference group. We will use post hoc test to determine the specific groups where there is a significant difference. 
 
   Next, we will plot boxplots, histogram, Q-Q plot, and scatter plots to visualize the distribution of data. We will also compute summary statistics such as median absolute deviation (MAD), coefficient of variation (CV), and Cohen's d.
 
 4. Insights
 
    From the analysis, we can infer that there might be certain demographic factors that affect product quality specifically for people using Facebook Messenger. One possible explanation is the individual differences caused by age. Older generations may have stronger impulse control and preferences for faster interaction styles and smoother voiceovers, whereas younger generations may find the delivery of images and video less reliable. Another factor might be the cultural context; older generations may feel more connected with friends' lives and may rely more heavily on automated bots, while younger generations may want a deeper connection with friends' family members. Therefore, improving the design of Messenger and focusing on providing better chat functionality, moderation tools, and access to existing communities would be effective strategies to improve Messenger's quality.
