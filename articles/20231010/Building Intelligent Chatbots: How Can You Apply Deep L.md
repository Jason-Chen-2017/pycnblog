# 2.	Core Concepts and Connections
## 2.1 Introduction
In the past decade or so, chatbots have become increasingly popular in various sectors such as customer service, retail, social media platforms, e-commerce platforms, healthcare, banking, and many others. While there are several ways to develop a chatbot, one of the most common methods is through natural language processing (NLP). NLP involves using machine learning algorithms to understand human speech, text, and intentions. The goal is then to generate an appropriate response based on what was understood from the input statement. 

However, developing intelligent chatbots that can provide a great user experience is still a challenging task. One reason for this difficulty is due to the complexity of understanding language, especially when it comes to conversational scenarios where context and nuances need to be taken into account. A better solution would involve using deep neural networks, which have proven to work well in solving complex tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.

Recently, artificial intelligence research has moved away from traditional supervised learning techniques towards more advanced unsupervised and reinforcement learning approaches. This shift has led to significant advances in natural language understanding and generation. In particular, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), specifically gated recurrent units (GRUs) and long short-term memory cells (LSTMs), have shown promise in building conversation models that can handle long sequences of data with high accuracy. These types of models have been used successfully in chatbots, providing them with end-to-end training capabilities.

Finally, leveraging transfer learning strategies can also help improve the performance of our chatbots by adapting their underlying language understanding and generation modules to the specificities of different domains or languages. Transfer learning, though not directly applicable to chatbots but rather to other applications within the field of natural language processing, provides us with a valuable technique for improving the robustness and generalization capacity of our systems.

## 2.2 History and Trends
Over the last few years, chatbot development has seen tremendous progress thanks to advancements in Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning. Although chatbots have existed for quite some time, they were mainly used in small talk forms such as Facebook Messenger or Twitter DMs. However, after the rise of AI personal assistants like Alexa and Siri in late 2014, the number of chatbots utilizing NLP technology increased rapidly.

The first successful chatbots came in March 2015 when Google launched its Project Loon mobile app and accompanied it with a natural language processor called Dialogflow. This tool allowed developers to build fully functional chatbots without any coding expertise. Over time, many companies started adopting chatbot solutions across multiple industries including banking, finance, travel, retail, and entertainment.

However, the hype around chatbot technologies led to concerns over privacy, security, ethics, and quality of services provided by these products. To address these issues, early chatbot developers often focused solely on creating engaging conversations. Despite these benefits, businesses had little interest in exploring further opportunities beyond simple interactions.

Fast forward three years later and we see the beginnings of the third wave of chatbot trends that aim to make chatbots even smarter than humans. These bots use natural language understanding and knowledge representation techniques like sentiment analysis, entity extraction, topic modeling, etc., to anticipate and respond to users’ queries in real-time. They offer seamless integration with existing ecosystems and back-office systems enabling agents to access relevant information quickly and easily.

By 2017, chatbot technologies have expanded beyond messaging apps to include voice interfaces, social media platforms, search engines, email notifications, interactive virtual assistants, and online shopping portals. Overall, the industry has seen exponential growth and is expected to continue growing exponentially in the coming years.

## 2.3 Types of Chatbots
There are two main categories of chatbots - rule-based chatbots and deep learning chatbots. Rule-based chatbots rely on simple if-else statements and pattern matching techniques to match user inputs against predefined responses. For example, a restaurant reservation bot may only accept booking requests for specified dates or times. On the other hand, deep learning chatbots employ powerful machine learning algorithms like RNNs, GRUs, LSTMs, CNNs, and transformers to capture semantic meaning and generate meaningful responses that reflect the user's intention. Here are some examples of each category:

**Rule-Based Chatbots**: 
These type of chatbots use regex patterns or keyword matching to define answers to questions asked by the user. Examples of rules-based chatbots include Alexa, Cortana, and Dialogflow.

**Deep Learning Chatbots:**
These chatbots utilize neural network architectures like convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and transformer models to extract meaning from text. These models learn to recognize patterns and concepts by analyzing large amounts of textual data. An example of a deep learning chatbot is Google's Conversational AI.

## 2.4 Key Technologies Used in Chatbots
Here are five key technologies used in chatbot development: 

1. **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Extracts meaning from user input text. It includes things like parsing sentences, identifying entities, extracting relationships between words, identifying themes, and classifying messages according to pre-defined classes or labels. There are numerous libraries available for implementing NLU. Some commonly used ones include NLTK, spaCy, and Stanford NLP.

2. **Natural Language Generation (NLG):** Generates appropriate output text based on input text and intended action. This step is critical because it enables chatbots to communicate effectively with users. We can use NLG techniques such as template-based generation, slot filling, and dialogue management. Template-based generation involves defining templates containing slots or placeholders that get filled with values extracted during NLU. Slot filling requires specifying a list of possible values and assigning them to slots based on the likelihood of occurrence. Finally, dialogue management helps in managing dialogues between chatbot and user by recording interactions and replaying them later.

3. **Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR&R):** KR&R is the process of representing domain-specific knowledge in a format that can be interpreted by machines. It uses techniques such as ontology engineering, ontological inference, and concept recognition to store and retrieve information efficiently. Common KR&R tools include Prolog, OWL/RDF, and SPARQL.

4. **Dialog Management System:** Enables chatbots to manage and control multi-turn conversations with users. This component ensures that the chatbot stays engaged throughout the conversation, providing smooth transitions and ensuring consistency in responses. There are various dialogue management frameworks such as DF-VOX, Dialogflow CX, Botpress, and VUIML.

5. **Conversation Design Patterns:** Conversation design patterns define a set of guidelines for constructing engaging and effective conversations with users. These patterns include storytelling, scenario-driven conversation design, topical question answering, and FAQ-driven conversational flows.

Overall, chatbot development relies on a combination of these technologies to achieve high levels of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.
