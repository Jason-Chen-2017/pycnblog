# 1.背景介绍


Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been a longstanding and challenging research problem in natural language processing. Despite the success of deep learning techniques like neural networks, state-of-the-art ASR systems still have several limitations that prevent them from being widely used. One such limitation is their lack of attention to context information in terms of linguistic or visual factors, which can be crucial for improved accuracy. In this work, we propose a new end-to-end architecture called ContextNet that exploits both local and global contextual information at multiple scales. The ContextNet model consists of an encoder-decoder structure with parallel convolutional blocks interleaved between different stages of the network. At each block, it uses cross-attention mechanisms to learn joint representations of input features across time and space dimensions, enabling efficient modeling of multi-scale contextual information. We also introduce skip connections between consecutive layers, allowing information from previous layers to flow through subsequent layers more efficiently than traditional feedforward architectures do. Our experiments on two popular datasets show significant improvement over state-of-the-art models despite their limited capacity due to low computation resources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms other approaches based on different strategies for incorporating contextual information including LSTMs, CNNs, and transformer architectures.
In summary, our paper introduces a novel end-to-end architecture named ContextNet, that utilizes parallel convolutional blocks with cross-attention mechanisms to capture both local and global contextual information, while also introducing skip connections to allow information from earlier layers to flow more efficiently. By combining these components into one framework, we achieve higher performance without compromising computational complexity, making it a promising choice for building high-accuracy automatic speech recognition systems.

## Cross Attention Mechanism
Cross attention mechanism allows us to jointly attend to input features across time and space dimensions by matching corresponding position embeddings learned for each feature map. It enables the network to consider not only individual features but also their interactions to provide better predictions. For example, if we focus on an utterance containing three words "A", "B" and "C," the cross attention mechanism will allow the network to recognize the relationship between adjacent words and predict the word following the third word as "D."

The key idea behind cross attention is that we assign weights to all pairs of input vectors, where the weight indicates how much attention should be paid to the pair’s corresponding output vector. To perform this task, we use a trainable linear projection matrix $W_{q}, W_{k}$ and scalar bias $\text{bias}_{q}, \text{bias}_{k}$, which are shared among all layers of the network. Then, we compute query Q and key K matrices as follows:
$$Q = W_{q} * x + \text{bias}_{q}$$
$$K = W_{k} * y + \text{bias}_{k}$$
where $x$ and $y$ represent the input sequences at respective positions, and $\cdot$ denotes pointwise multiplication. Next, we calculate the scaled dot product of Q and K matrices, i.e., the unnormalized attention scores:
$$\text{Attention}(Q,K)=softmax(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})V$$
where V represents the value vectors obtained from another layer of the network. Finally, we multiply the attention scores by the value vectors to obtain the weighted sum, which is then passed to another layer to generate the final output. Here, $\text{softmax}(\cdot)$ is the softmax function applied element-wise, $d_k$ is the dimensionality of keys and queries.

## Parallel Convolutional Blocks
Parallel convolutional blocks are composed of convolutional layers, batch normalization, ReLU activation functions and residual connections. They enable capturing contextual information from various spatial and temporal scales simultaneously, leading to better representation of inputs. Moreover, they help reduce the vanishing gradient problem experienced by traditional recurrent neural networks, enabling training very deep neural networks with fewer parameters compared to recurrent ones.

## Skip Connections
Skip connections allow information from preceding layers to flow seamlessly to later layers within a network. This helps avoid the degradation of low-level features during deeper layers, resulting in increased expressiveness and improving generalization ability of the network. Fig. 2 shows an illustration of skip connections in action.
