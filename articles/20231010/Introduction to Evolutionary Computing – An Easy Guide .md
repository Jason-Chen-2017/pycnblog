# 1.背景介绍


Evolutionary computing is a powerful technique that can be used for solving complex problems by using biological principles and natural selection mechanisms. It involves the study of populations or groups of similar individuals with different traits and behavioural patterns. This field has been revolutionizing the way we approach optimization algorithms, artificial intelligence, genetic programming, and many other applications in science, engineering, and business. In this article, we will explore evolutionary computing through its history and present an easy-to-understand guide on population based methods. 

Evolutionary computation was first proposed as a tool to solve optimization problems but has now gained significant interest in various fields such as economics, finance, management, healthcare, industry, and social sciences. One popular application area is market design where the goal is to find the best combination of products and services offered to consumers within certain constraints. Another common use case is pattern recognition where the system tries to identify patterns or features in data sets by optimizing the parameters associated with each feature's contribution towards overall accuracy. A third example is robotic swarm optimization which aims to find the optimal configuration of robots working together to accomplish a task under given constraints. The importance of evolutionary computations stems from their ability to search the space of possible solutions efficiently, scalability, robustness, and adaptability.  

The traditional approach to optimization uses deterministic techniques like gradient descent, while population based methods use probabilistic approaches like simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Each method uses either explicit fitness functions or implicit fitness functions to evaluate the quality of candidate solutions, adjusting them according to their relative ranking among the population. Different population based methods differ in terms of their selection strategy, replacement strategy, mutation operator, crossover operator, and convergence criteria. Here are some popular examples:

1. Genetic algorithm - A classical population based optimization technique inspired by DNA sequencing. It operates by randomly generating initial population members, applying mutations, selecting parents for reproduction, and replacing the least fit members with offspring during each iteration until converge. Commonly used operators include uniform crossover and bit-flip mutation. 

2. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) - A popular population based optimization technique that employs several particles representing potential solutions in search spaces. Particles move around in search space following random walks with varying velocities, and their personal best positions are updated continuously. PSO works well when there is no clear global optimum. Commonly used operators include linear weight update, exponential weight update, and adaptive velocity updates.

3. Simulated Annealing - A heuristic optimization technique that is particularly effective for large state spaces. It starts with a high temperature and gradually decreases it over time until the solution settles at a local minimum. Commonly used operators include neighbor exchange and perturbation.

4. Self-adaptive Genetic Algorithm (SAGA) - A variant of genetic algorithm that adapts the mutation strength and crossover probability during runtime to improve the performance. SAGA dynamically modifies the objective function and evaluation metrics to optimize the current generation. Commonly used operators include dynamic mutation and subpopulation migration.

5. Crowding Binary Genetic Algorithm (CBGA) - A variant of binary genetic algorithm that explores more diverse region of search space by considering crowded regions of feasible solutions. CBGA maintains a distance between selected parents and offspring for diversity maintenance. Commonly used operators include k-point crossover and Lévy flight.

6. Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) - A population based optimization technique inspired by gravitational attraction between celestial bodies and galaxies. GSA solves optimization problem in discrete spaces by simulating real world physics using mathematical models such as Newtonian mechanics and relativity. Commonly used operators include gravity model selection and physical interaction module. 

In this article, we will focus on genetic algorithm because it is widely used and has been successful in various applications such as optimizing routing protocols, scheduling, network design, and parameter tuning. We will cover key concepts, algorithms, and operations involved in genetic algorithm, including selection, variation, and termination conditions. Additionally, we will illustrate these concepts and algorithms using detailed code examples and visualizations. Finally, we will discuss future research directions in evolutionary computing and highlight practical issues related to implementing evolutionary algorithms.
