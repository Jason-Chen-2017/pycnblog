# 1.背景介绍


Text mining has become one of the most popular applications in the field of Big Data Analysis. The goal is to analyze large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured textual data by extracting valuable insights from it. Text clustering refers to dividing a set of documents into groups based on their similarity and semantics. In this article, we will discuss how to cluster texts using word embeddings and k-means clustering algorithm. 

Word embedding is an approach used for representing words in vector space such that related words have similar vectors and dissimilar words have different vectors. One way to represent text as a sequence of vectors is by using word embeddings. Word embeddings capture semantic relationships between words, which can be exploited for clustering. A typical workflow involves first preparing a corpus of texts and then training a word embedding model on it. Once trained, each document can be represented as a dense vector of its word embeddings, and subsequently clustered using algorithms like K-Means.

K-Means is a popular clustering algorithm that partitions n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid), serving as a prototype representation of the cluster. It works iteratively to assign samples to the nearest centroid until convergence or user specified number of iterations are reached. The final result is a partitioning of the original dataset into clusters where each cluster contains examples of similar characteristics according to some distance metric such as Euclidean distance between two points in vector space.

In our work, we will use Python programming language along with several libraries including NumPy, Scikit-learn, Gensim and Keras. We will also download various corpora of texts, such as news articles, Wikipedia dumps, etc., to experiment with clustering.

## Text Clustering
Text clustering refers to dividing a set of documents into groups based on their similarity and semantics. Documents sharing similar content belong to same group while those having distinct contents form separate clusters. Popular methods for text clustering include K-means clustering and DBSCAN. 

### K-means clustering 
K-means is a clustering algorithm that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid). The algorithm starts by selecting initial values for the means randomly, and then repeatedly assigns each point to the closest mean until all points are assigned. Each iteration updates the means to be the centroid of the cluster to which they belong, resulting in refined estimates of the underlying distribution. Finally, the algorithm returns a set of k centers, which define the locations of the clusters, together with a membership indicator for each input observation indicating the corresponding cluster index. K-means has a simple mathematical description and provides intuitive understanding of what "clustering" means mathematically. However, it may not perform well when applied directly to natural language processing tasks due to the following reasons:

1. Sparsity - Language models learn to predict the probability distribution over all possible tokens in a vocabulary given a sequence of previous tokens. This requires a very sparse representation of texts since most words do not occur in every sentence.
2. Dimensionality - Natural language texts often contain many thousands of unique words, making traditional dimensionality reduction techniques impractical for clustering purposes.

To address these issues, we need more powerful representations than individual token frequencies. Hence, we need to use distributed representations of words that capture contextual information about them. Distributed representations enable us to exploit both local and global structure within text data.

### DBSCAN clustering
DBSCAN stands for Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise. It is a density-based clustering method that detects clusters of high density separated by areas of low density. The basic idea behind DBSCAN is to identify core samples of high density, reachable neighbors, and outliers. Core samples are defined as samples that are close to at least min_samples other samples, and reachable samples are defined as samples that are within eps distance of another sample. Outliers are samples that are neither core nor reachable, i.e., they are further away than eps from any neighboring sample. DBSCAN generates clusters by progressively growing clusters around core samples and ignoring noise points, thereby identifying regions of higher density separated by regions of lower density. Therefore, DBSCAN produces more meaningful results compared to standard clustering methods such as K-means. However, the main issue with DBSCAN is that it only applies to spatial data sets. If the data consists of non-spatial attributes, such as temporal, categorical or ordinal variables, DBSCAN cannot handle such datasets effectively. Moreover, DBSCAN suffers from sensitivity to parameter selection, especially eps and min_samples parameters. To avoid these challenges, other clustering algorithms such as K-means should be preferred over DBSCAN whenever applicable.

## Word Embeddings
Word embedding is an approach used for representing words in vector space such that related words have similar vectors and dissimilar words have different vectors. It was proposed in 2013 by Mikolov et al. and became widely adopted recently. It maps words to a continuous vector space where vectors are dense but low dimensional. The key advantage of using word embeddings is that it captures the semantic relationships between words rather than just the syntactic patterns present in raw text. Thus, it allows us to compute distances between words efficiently and thus perform better clustering.

There are three major types of word embeddings:

1. Count-based word embeddings - These are the simplest type of word embeddings that map each word to a fixed length vector by counting co-occurrences of the word in the surrounding context of a window size of interest. For example, Google News uses count-based word embeddings called Word2Vec.

2. Neural Network-based word embeddings - These are deep neural networks that take into account not just the surrounding context of a word, but also the entire sentence or paragraph that the word appears in. They produce richer vector representations than the ones obtained through counts alone. Examples of such embeddings are ELMo and BERT. 

3. Hybrid Models - Some hybrid approaches combine the strengths of count-based and neural network-based models by combining the outputs of both models. An example of such model is fastText. 

Count-based and NN-based models require extensive preprocessing steps before they can be used for downstream NLP tasks. Pretrained word embeddings provide ready-to-use representations of words without requiring any explicit training. Hence, they make it easier to apply clustering algorithms to text data.

## How does it work?
We start by downloading a collection of text data, say, news articles. Next, we preprocess the data by removing stopwords, punctuations, and stemming/lemmatizing the remaining words. Then, we convert the preprocessed sentences into sequences of word embeddings using pretrained word embeddings such as Word2Vec, Fasttext, or GloVe. Finally, we apply K-means clustering algorithm on the word embeddings to obtain clusters of similar documents.

Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. Download Corpus of Text Data: We collect a corpus of text data such as news articles or Wikipedia dumps and store them in a directory named `corpus`.

2. Tokenize Sentences: Given a corpus, we tokenize each sentence into a list of words. Stopwords, punctuation marks, and numbers are removed from the list. Lemmatization/Stemming converts multiple forms of a word to a single root word, reducing sparsity. After this step, we get a list of lists where each inner list represents a sentence.

3. Train Word Embeddings Model: We train a word embedding model such as Word2Vec or GloVe on the corpus to generate dense vector representations of words. We choose a suitable dimensionality of output vectors such that they capture both local and global aspects of word meaning. After training, we save the weights of the learned embeddings so that we can reuse them later during inference.

4. Convert Sentences to Vectors: We convert each sentence in the corpus to a dense vector representation of its word embeddings using the saved embeddings. We concatenate the vectors to get a single feature vector per sentence. We also normalize the feature vectors to unit length to ensure that cosine similarity behaves as expected.

5. Apply K-Means Algorithm: We apply the K-means clustering algorithm on the feature vectors to divide the corpus into clusters. During initialization, we select random starting centres for each cluster. We iterate over the epochs until convergence or max number of iterations are reached. At each epoch, we update the positions of the centres based on the current assignment of points to clusters. We repeat this process until convergence or max number of iterations are reached.

6. Visualize Clusters: We visualize the clusters using tools such as t-SNE or UMAP projections to study the intrinsic geometry of the data. We can observe trends such as shifts in direction, elongation, or contraction in the clusters. We also look for patterns that reveal hidden structures in the data.
