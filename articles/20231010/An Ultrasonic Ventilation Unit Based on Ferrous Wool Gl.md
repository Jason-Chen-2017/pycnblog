# 1.背景介绍


Ultrasonic ventilation is one of the most significant developments in respiratory care during the last few decades and has become a popular technique for patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It helps to improve oxygenation level and reduce airway inflammation. 

However, it requires special preparations such as a high-pressure container filled with spare air from the patient’s lung that pushes against the wall at high speed, which can be both inconvenient and potentially hazardous if not done properly. Among these difficulties are chemical contamination caused by foreign bodies, noise emanating from the outside environment, increased volume due to breathing pressure and consequently reduced ability to ventilate large amounts of air. To overcome these challenges, researchers have proposed various designs including vacuum unit systems, active control systems, and passive mesh ducts. However, they typically use metallic materials like stainless steel or composite materials. Therefore, there remains an unmet need for developing more advanced technologies using ferrous wool glass material since its mechanical properties offer high flexibility, low cost and good adhesion to buildings.

In this work, we present a new ultrasonic ventilation system based on ferrous wool glass material. The main advantages of our approach include:

1) High strength and corrosion resistance of ferrous wool glass reduces chance of damage to internal components.

2) Easy handling and installation makes it easy to deploy and maintain.

3) Modular design simplifies maintenance and upgrades.

4) Temperature sensitivity allows precise control of flow rate through heat transfer between humidified and cooled gas streams.

This article describes how we developed an ultrasonic ventilation unit based on ferrous wool glass material that uses sound waves to produce compressed air, performs acoustic insulation between walls and airways, compresses air into a smaller diameter than conventional devices, and circulates the air without any vents or pressurization elements. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our prototype device compared to other existing devices using a series of test results. Finally, we discuss future directions for improving our design and exploring related areas such as healthcare technology, biomechanics, and manufacturing processes. 

2.Core Concepts and Connections
The core concepts and connections behind the development of our project are outlined below. These concepts will help us understand the problem statement better, describe our solution, provide contextual information about ferrous wool glass, and set the stage for building our prototype device. 

2.1 Problem Statement: Developing an ultrasound ventilation unit using ferrous wool glass material
There exists a lack of appropriate ventilation units for COPD patients who require rapid ventilation rates because of their unique needs such as long duration, low-oxygenation requirements, wide operating range, and high frequency of operation. As part of our effort to address this issue, we propose to develop an ultrasonic ventilation unit using ferrous wool glass material. This would enable the deployment of ultrasonic ventilators within minutes rather than hours and significantly decrease the time required for preparation and maintenance. Other benefits of the system include high strength and corrosion resistance of the material, ease of construction and handling, modular design, temperature sensitivity, etc. 

To achieve these goals, we first need to formulate a problem statement. Our goal is to create an ultrasonic ventilation system using ferrous wool glass that provides continuous ventilation regardless of ambient temperature while reducing noise emissions. Since the primary challenge of our project lies in achieving accurate ventilation, we focus on the following metrics to assess performance:

1) Efficiency - Measured as the ratio of delivered airflow to ambient pressure difference across the room perceived by human ears.

2) Volumetric Flow Rate - Measured as the total mass of air removed per second divided by the cross-sectional area of the ventilator.

3) Penetration Ratio - Measured as the fraction of airflow passing through the ventilator before reaching the lungs.

4) Cost Effectiveness - Compares costs of existing and improved technology solutions. 

Once we have established the problem statement, we need to specify what constitutes a "good" ventilator. According to NASA's Healthy Atmosphere Institute, there are three key parameters that must be considered when choosing a ventilator design:

1) Continuous Ventilation - Patients requiring continuous ventilation should receive sufficient oxygenated air to meet body fatigue and other physical demands.

2) Low Oxygenation Requirement - Inpatients usually have lower oxygenation levels due to poor kidney function and need to access critical resources in home isolation settings.

3) Wide Operating Range - Many COD patients operate in high altitude conditions where extreme weather events may cause respiratory failure. The majority of open field ventilators are designed for only urban environments or tight spaces.

We now have a clear understanding of the problem, but let's continue discussing some important definitions and concepts.

2.2 Core Terms and Definitions
Now that we've discussed the background and problem statement, let's move onto defining some terms and concepts used throughout the rest of the paper. Here's a brief overview of the relevant definitions:

2.2.1 Defining Terms
* Room Air Suitability Index (RASI): A metric that measures the quality of air around a person's lungs and airways. RASI ranges from 0-100% with higher values indicating better suitability.

* Design Pressure (DP): The maximum allowable dynamic pressure experienced by the device during normal operation. DP is influenced by the size, weight, geometry, configuration, arrangement, and vibration characteristics of the device. 

* Peak Compressibility of Air (PCA): The ratio of compressibility of air at high pressure to that at standard pressure. PCA varies from 1.4 to 1.7 depending on the type of material being analyzed.

* Constant-Pressure Expansion (CPE): A method of calculating the fluid expansion coefficient based on the change in the pressure and the initial pressure differences. CPE relies on solving static equations involving the natural logarithm and inverse trigonometric functions.

* Sound Speed: The propagation speed of sound waves in free space. It is approximately equal to 343 m/s.

2.2.2 Understanding Lung Compartment Geometry and Size
Ferrous wool glass is composed of two distinct layers: a semi-permeable matrix layer and a non-permeable filler layer that interfaces with the matrix. The semi-permeable surface layer is highly porous and offers a high degree of elasticity. The filler layer forms a dense sheet within the interface between the matrix and adjacent tissues, providing additional structural support and preventing cracking and buckling. Because ferrous wool glass is made up of numerous small particles, it exhibits smoothness and lightness similar to dry porous media.

Our ultimate objective is to deliver continuous ventilation under favorable ambient conditions. When exposed to external stimuli such as the presence of people, animals, or moving objects, the lungs start to hematize, resulting in dilution of blood oxygen levels until saturation occurs. Despite the increasing risk factors associated with inhaling toxins, the current state of art still does not provide an effective means of ventilating individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), especially those living in resource-limited settings or geographically dispersed populations.

One way to address this gap is to improve the efficiency and comfort of COPD patients by optimizing their ventilation efforts. Specifically, we want to maximize the flowrate of air removing through the nose, throat, and abdomen with minimal interference from outside sources such as people, vehicles, furniture, or buildings. While traditional methods such as regular chamber or ballast ventilation achieve adequate ventilation rates in controlled environments, they are bulky, expensive, and impractical in resource-constrained scenarios. Additionally, although ultrasonic ventilation has been shown to increase the lifetime of arterial hypertension by reducing bleeding risk, it requires specialized equipment and expertise and cannot yet replace or supplement therapy offered through medical professionals. Thus, there is a need for novel approaches to optimize lung ventilation in chronic diseases that do not rely solely on surgery or advanced chemotherapy modalities.
