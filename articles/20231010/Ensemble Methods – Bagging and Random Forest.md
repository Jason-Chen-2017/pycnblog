# 1.背景介绍


Ensemble methods are powerful machine learning algorithms that combine multiple models to make better predictions than any individual model could alone. In this article, we will discuss two commonly used ensemble techniques: bagging and random forest. 

Bagging is a type of ensemble method where we create several instances (or clones) of an existing algorithm or model using the same training data but with different randomly selected subsets of the data. The resulting ensemble is called a "bag" because it is made up of bags of bootstrap samples from the original dataset. Each member of the bag uses its own subset of the data for training and prediction, leading to further reduction in variance due to the diversity of inputs.

Random forest is another type of ensemble method inspired by the concept of decision trees. It works by creating several decision trees on bootstrapped datasets. At each node of each tree, a certain number of features is chosen at random to split into left and right child nodes, creating a branching pattern that simulates how the data would be organized under different conditions. During testing time, a new sample is passed through each tree sequentially until a leaf node is reached, which gives a classification or regression value based on the majority vote of all the leaves. This approach can lead to much higher accuracy than traditional decision trees because it combines several weak models together to form one stronger model.

Both bagging and random forest have been found effective at reducing overfitting and improving generalization performance. However, they also come with some drawbacks such as longer training times, larger memory usage, and increased risk of overfitting. Overall, both bagging and random forest provide valuable insights into how complex tasks can be broken down into simpler parts and combined to achieve robust results.

In this blog post, I will explain the core concepts and principles behind bagging and random forest, demonstrate their implementation using Python code examples, and then share my experience working with them in a real-world scenario. 

# 2. Core Concepts and Relationship
## Bagged Trees
We start our discussion of bagged trees with the basic idea of aggregating many trees instead of relying only on one. Instead of building a single tree directly on the entire dataset, we divide the data into $K$ groups or "bags," each containing a separate set of observations sampled randomly from the original dataset with replacement. We train a separate decision tree on each bag independently and use the outputs of these trees to make final predictions. The result is an overall improvement in predictive power, since each tree learns to make decisions that are complementary to those made by other trees. If there are correlated errors among the trees, bagging helps to reduce them by combining their output estimates. Since each tree is trained on a slightly different version of the data, bagging has the effect of reducing variance and thus making the overall model more accurate.

The mathematical basis behind bagging involves sampling with replacement, which means that every observation may appear in one of the $K$ bags or none at all. Moreover, each bag represents a probability distribution, so if the input variables are independent, the corresponding distributions within the balls will be normal. A bagging classifier simply averages the class probabilities predicted by the component classifiers to produce its final prediction. Similarly, a bagging regressor applies the mean function to the predicted values to arrive at its final estimate.

The reason why bagging produces improved predictions is that it trains several models on slightly different versions of the data, giving the component models greater flexibility and capacity to fit the training data without becoming too dependent on the particularities of any one instance. By averaging the predictions across all the models, the bagging algorithm can learn to reduce overfitting while still retaining the ability to accurately predict on new data.

## Random Forests
Random forests are similar to bagged trees in that they aggregate several decision trees rather than just one. However, whereas bagging gathers diverse trees, random forests build each tree independently and select only a random subset of features to split on at each node. For example, suppose we want to build a binary decision tree on the iris dataset with six possible outcomes and three features. One way to do this is to consider all six features at each node and choose randomly between them to split on. Another way might be to consider only three out of the six available features at each node, choosing the best feature based on statistical criterion like information gain or Gini index.

To ensure that each tree is well represented, random forests perform additional pruning operations after constructing each tree. Specifically, each time a split in a tree is considered, a small fraction of the training data is reserved for testing purposes. This procedure reduces overfitting by preventing the creation of branches that correspond to noise or unimportant features. Once the tree has been constructed, it can be applied to new data to obtain a predicted outcome, typically using majority voting or weighted sums of the output estimates from the constituent trees.

While bagging and random forest are both ensemble methods that combine several models to improve predictive performance, there are some key differences between the two approaches. First, bagging creates a set of models that work independently of each other; while random forests are designed specifically to handle high-dimensional data and categorical variables, they require careful tuning to avoid overfitting. Second, although both procedures aim to address the problem of overfitting, they differ in terms of the extent to which they succeed. While bagging trades off variance for bias, random forests trade off bias for variance. Finally, random forests generally require less computational resources than bagging, thanks to their emphasis on subsampling.
