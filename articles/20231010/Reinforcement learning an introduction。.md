# 1.背景介绍


Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning that allows machines to learn from experience in order to make decisions or take actions that lead to a desired outcome. In the field of RL, agents interact with environments and receive feedback in terms of rewards and punishments. The goal of reinforcement learning is for the agent to learn how to achieve its goals by acting intelligently within the environment. Reinforcement learning algorithms can be classified into three main categories: model-based, model-free, and hybrid methods. 

The problem with traditional supervised learning techniques is that they are only able to learn from labeled data where each observation has been assigned a corresponding label. It becomes difficult to generalize to new situations as it requires retraining the algorithm with new examples. On the other hand, unsupervised learning techniques can capture patterns in complex datasets but may struggle when the underlying structure is not clear.

In contrast, deep reinforcement learning uses artificial neural networks to create policies which map states to actions. These policies are learned using backpropagation through time (BPTT), a powerful technique used in training neural networks effectively. However, building accurate models can be challenging due to the high dimensionality of state space and the complexity of decision-making processes in real-world applications. 

This article will focus on understanding key ideas behind reinforcement learning and covering two core algorithmic approaches: value iteration and policy iteration. We'll also discuss extensions such as Q-learning and actor-critic, and their advantages over value functions. Finally, we'll explore some common problems associated with reinforcement learning including exploration vs exploitation, exploration strategies, off-policy methods, and parallel computing. 

We assume readers have a basic knowledge of probability, linear algebra, calculus, optimization, and programming. We'll provide links to resources if needed at the end of this article.

## Markov Decision Process (MDP)

A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a tuple $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, P, R, \gamma)$, where $\mathcal{S}$ represents the set of states, $\mathcal{A}$ represents the set of actions, $P$ represents the state transition probabilities, $R$ represents the reward function, and $\gamma$ is the discount factor. An MDP is often represented graphically as follows:


An MDP defines an agent's interaction with the world, allowing us to represent both the agent's perception of the world and its possible actions. The agent receives a state $s_t$, makes an action $a_t$ according to its policy $\pi(a_t|s_t)$, and transitions to a new state $s_{t+1}$. Based on this transition, the agent receives a reward $r_{t+1}$. Given these transitions and rewards, we want to find a policy that maximizes cumulative reward over all future steps. This process is called "reinforcement learning" because the agent learns what action to take based on its past experiences.

Formally, let $P^a_{\tau}(s') = Pr\{ s_{t+1}=s' | a_t=\tau, s_t=s\}$, representing the probability of transitioning to state $s'$ after taking action $\tau$. Then, the expected return at time step $t$ is given by:

$$G_t = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\gamma^k r_{t+k+1}$$

where $\gamma$ is the discount factor. The optimal policy $\pi_*$ is one that maximizes expected return:

$$\pi_*(s) = argmax_\tau E[G_t|\tau]$$

The fundamental concept behind reinforcement learning is the Bellman equation:

$$V^\pi(s)=\underset{\pi}{\text{max}}E_{s'\sim P(\cdot|s,\pi)}\left[\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^tr_t\right]\forall s\in S.$$

This equation says that the optimal value function $V^{\pi_*}$ for any state $s$ satisfies the Bellman expectation equation. The left side of the equation contains the maximum expected return that can be obtained starting from state $s$ following the policy $\pi$. The right side involves recursively evaluating the sum of discounted future rewards for each possible next state $s'$. The formula for the value function reduces to the iterative solution of the Bellman equation.

However, there exist many practical issues with solving the Bellman equation directly. One issue is that it can be computationally expensive since it involves finding the optimal action repeatedly for each state during each iteration. Another issue is that the Bellman equation assumes the existence of a perfect model of the MDP, which may not always hold true. Therefore, we need to use approximation techniques like dynamic programming and monte carlo simulation to calculate the value function accurately even for large and complex MDPs.

## Value Iteration & Policy Iteration
Value Iteration and Policy Iteration are the two most commonly used reinforcement learning algorithms. Both of them are designed to estimate the optimal value function and/or policy respectively. They differ in how they update their estimates compared to ordinary linear regression. Value Iteration calculates the optimal value function by updating the values iteratively until convergence, whereas Policy Iteration updates the policy iteratively based on the current value estimate. Both algorithms involve repeated updates to the estimated value and policy until convergence. 

### Value Iteration
Value Iteration is based on the Bellman expectation equation discussed earlier. At each iteration, the algorithm updates the value of each state using the current policy:

$$V_{k+1}(s) = \underset{\pi}{\text{max}}\sum_{t=1}^{+\infty}\gamma^{t-1}r_t + \gamma V_k(s')\forall s\in S,$$

where $V_k$ is the updated value function at iteration $k$. The outer loop runs for a fixed number of iterations or until the change in the value function between iterations is less than a certain threshold. Once the algorithm converges, it returns the optimal value function $V^\ast$. The performance of Value Iteration depends heavily on the initialization of the value function and the discount factor chosen. If either of these parameters is not carefully selected, the algorithm might fail to converge or diverge prematurely.

Here's an example implementation of Value Iteration in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

def value_iteration(P, R, gamma, epsilon):
    n_states, n_actions, _ = P.shape
    
    # initialize value function to zero
    V = np.zeros((n_states))

    while True:
        delta = 0
        
        # compute Q value for each state-action pair
        Q = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))

        for s in range(n_states):
            for a in range(n_actions):
                Q[s][a] = R[s][a]
                
                for ns in range(n_states):
                    Q[s][a] += gamma * np.dot(P[s][a], V)
        
        # compute difference between old and new value function
        diff = abs(np.subtract(Q, V)).max()
        
        # check if convergence criteria met
        if diff < epsilon:
            break
        
        # update value function
        V = np.copy(Q)
        
    return V, Q
```

### Policy Iteration
Policy Iteration works similarly to Value Iteration, except instead of calculating the value function, it optimizes a stochastic policy by updating its parameterization after each iteration. Here's an overview of how Policy Iteration works:

1. Initialize random policy $\pi$
2. Evaluate the current policy using value iteration
3. Improve the policy by following greedy strategy using the current value estimate:

   $$\pi_{k+1}(a|s) = \frac{\exp\{Q_{k}(s,a)/\epsilon\}}{\Sigma_{a'} \exp\{Q_{k}(s,a')/\epsilon\}} $$

   where $\epsilon$ is a temperature hyperparameter determining the degree of exploration. 

4. Repeat steps 2-3 until convergence.

Here's an example implementation of Policy Iteration in Python:

```python
def policy_iteration(P, R, gamma, epsilon):
    n_states, n_actions, _ = P.shape
    
    # initialize random policy
    pi = np.random.rand(n_states, n_actions)
    pi /= pi.sum(axis=1).reshape((-1, 1))
    
    while True:
        # evaluate current policy using value iteration
        _, Q = value_iteration(P, R, gamma, epsilon)
        
        # improve policy using greedy approach
        N = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))
        G = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))
        
        for s in range(n_states):
            for a in range(n_actions):
                N[s][a] = np.sum([P[s][a][ns]*pi[ns][ap]/np.power(gamma, t) 
                                  for ap, ns in enumerate(range(n_states))])
                G[s][a] = Q[s][a]+N[s][a]
        
        policy_stable = True
        
        for s in range(n_states):
            old_action = np.argmax(pi[s])
            
            # determine new action using softmax distribution
            z = np.sum([np.exp(g/epsilon) for g in G[s]])
            prob = [np.exp(g/epsilon)/z for g in G[s]]
            new_action = np.random.choice(range(n_actions), p=prob)
            
            if old_action!= new_action:
                policy_stable = False
                pi[s] *= 0
                pi[s][new_action] = 1
        
        # check if policy stable before continuing
        if policy_stable:
            break
            
    return pi
```

In summary, both Value Iteration and Policy Iteration are useful tools for approximating the optimal value function and policy in finite Markov Decision Processes. However, these algorithms require careful tuning of the discount factor and initial value function to ensure convergence. Additionally, Policy Iteration involves exponentially many iterations compared to Value Iteration, making it slower than Value Iteration for larger MDPs.
