## What is an Availability Zone?

An availability zone (AZ) in AWS refers to a physically isolated and independent section of the AWS global infrastructure. Each AZ is completely isolated from every other AZ, including separate power, network, and cooling resources. 

Availability zones are designed to help achieve high availability for applications running on AWS. When designing an application that needs to be highly available, it is recommended that the architecture includes multiple instances or components deployed across different AZs to ensure maximum uptime. For example, if your web server is running behind a load balancer, you can deploy it across two or more AZs to increase its availability. If one AZ becomes unavailable due to natural disaster or other unforeseen circumstances, the system will still function normally because there are redundant instances running in another AZ. Similarly, if you have multiple copies of data stored in Amazon S3, you can replicate them across multiple AZs to prevent any single point of failure. 

The following diagram shows how EC2 instances can be distributed across multiple AZs within a region to provide redundancy and increased fault tolerance. In this scenario, four AZs are used to distribute the three types of instances - web servers, database servers, and file storage servers. This setup ensures that even if one type of instance fails, the remaining instances can continue to serve traffic without interruption.  



Availability zones also provide a cost effective way to build resilient systems by providing low-latency network connectivity between regions. The shorter distance and lower bandwidth costs associated with inter-zone networking compared to intra-region networking makes it easier to create systems that are resistant to failures caused by network outages, disasters, or physical connectivity issues. Additionally, since AZs are located physically separated geographically, they can be used as backup locations in case one region goes down entirely.

In addition to improving resiliency, availability zones offer several additional benefits such as better security through isolation, improved reliability through replication, flexibility to scale up or down resources within the same region, and ability to use spot instances which can save significant amounts of money on large compute workloads.

It's important to note that not all services provided by AWS support multi-AZ deployments. Some services like Amazon Elastic File System do not yet have full cross-AZ durability guarantees, so replicating these volumes across multiple AZs may not always be necessary. However, many other services such as Amazon RDS, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, and Amazon DynamoDB already support high availability and automatically distribute their data across multiple AZs by default. Therefore, it’s essential to make sure your architectures include both single-AZ and multi-AZ configurations wherever possible to ensure highest level of resiliency and fault tolerance.



## Why Use Multi-AZ Architectures?

Using Availability Zones offers several advantages over traditional deployment models. Here are some reasons why using multi-AZ architectures is worth considering:

1. Higher Uptime: Within each AZ, at least two instances of your application are running simultaneously to reduce downtime. In addition, if one AZ becomes unavailable, the other AZ takes over quickly thanks to automatic failover capabilities. 

2. Better Fault Tolerance: Your entire system can fail without affecting users, as long as at least one instance remains active. In fact, Amazon has stated that more than 99% of AWS customers have chosen to run their critical production systems across multiple AZs. 

3. Cost Efficiency: By deploying your application across multiple AZs, you can reduce the risk of hardware failures or unexpected electricity outages affecting only part of your infrastructure. This approach also reduces the impact of natural disasters, such as hurricanes or floods, reducing the need for expensive emergency evacuations.

4. Latency Reduction: Because your application is deployed across multiple AZs, connections between user requests and backend databases are closer together resulting in faster response times. Additionally, the choice of AZ can influence the latency of various cloud operations, such as loading objects from Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), storing data in Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), querying data in Amazon ElasticSearch Service (Amazon ES). 

5. Data Durability: As mentioned earlier, certain services like Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) don't currently support fully-durable replicas across multiple AZs. It’s therefore crucial to choose appropriate technologies and solutions based on specific requirements to avoid data loss or inconsistencies. 


In summary, while choosing to use Availability Zones is no easy task, it provides substantial benefits that justify the investment needed to implement and maintain robust, scalable and reliable systems. Whether you're building a new application or migrating an existing one, whether you've just launched or been maintaining an enterprise-level service, we recommend adopting an AZ-based architecture to meet business needs and maximize operational efficiency.
