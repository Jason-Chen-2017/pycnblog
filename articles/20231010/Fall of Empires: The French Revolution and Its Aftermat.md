# 1.背景介绍


The French revolution is a global event that occurred in the early twentieth century as an attempt to liberate France from its colonial rule. Although it brought about many positive changes for France, including political freedom, greater economic opportunities, more effective institutions, and access to higher education, the revolution also marked a period of change in politics and society. This article will analyze the development of France during the early years of the twentieth century before and after the French revolution. It will focus on the key issues, events, and people involved in the revolution, which have had significant impact on Europe and on the future of France today.

In this analysis, we will use data sources from the European Union's (EU) GDPP (General Data Protection Regulation), the National Assembly of France (as it was known at the time), official documents from the various administrations responsible for government affairs, speeches by leaders who were instrumental in shaping the country, and interviews with individuals affected by or directly affected by the revolution. We will try to gain insights into how these events and people influenced and changed France's politics, culture, economy, society, and ideas over the course of the first half of the twentieth century before the French revolution, and what they might suggest about the potential role of women and minorities in the post-revolution period. Finally, we will look forward to see what new challenges and opportunities arise from this historical context, especially for young people and their aspirations for success.

Let's begin our analysis!

## 2.Core Concepts and Contacts
Before understanding the history of France, let us start with some core concepts and relationships between them:

1. Politics - The study of governance, elections, policies, and laws that determine how states operate within their borders.

2. Social Structure - Understanding the formation, maintenance, and decline of social and economic structure throughout different periods of French history.

3. Culture - An integral part of any nation's identity, culture shapes individual behaviors, values, attitudes, beliefs, and expectations. In France, there are many forms of art and literature that reflect traditional French values, traditions, and customs.

4. Economy - A combination of factors such as industry, trade, transportation, finances, and markets that influence the success of businesses and societies.

5. Gender Equality - The right of all women to equal rights and privileges without discrimination based on race, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, ethnicity, gender expression, age, marital status, or physical appearance.

6. Education - Educating youth is essential to promote their personal growth, skill development, and career prospects. Public schools provide the primary educational opportunities for most citizens, while private schools, universities, and colleges help equip workers for advanced careers.

These core concepts can be explained using simple examples. For example, "politics" could mean how voters choose representatives to vote on bills, how parliamentary systems function, and how bourgeois political parties work. Similarly, "culture" means recognizing each other through songs, dances, food, traditions, and clothing. And so on.

To understand the relationship among these core concepts, we need to consider three main paths towards achieving national security:

1. Victory through Democracy - By protecting fundamental freedoms and liberties, democratic institutions create conditions for mass participation, increase public engagement, encourage political cohesion, and improve political power distribution.

2. Rule Through Institutions - Established institutions like courts, police forces, and judicial systems ensure efficient policymaking, prevent corruption, and strengthen state capacity for action.

3. Security through Strong Institutions - Despite threats and internal conflicts, strong institutions, like diplomatic channels, military force, and civilian garrisons, provide continuous protection against terrorism and natural disasters.

These three ways of securing national security cannot exist independently. They require working together in concert to achieve collective goals. However, not everybody agrees with this viewpoint, particularly those close to the throne and supported by powerful men. As a result, there has been a growing division in Western culture between two camps - the radical left and the moderate right - attempting to balance these conflicting views.

Another important aspect to note is that even though French culture has embraced diversity, there is still much homogeneity among France's population. Not surprisingly, the highest rates of socioeconomic inequality across Europe remain the same throughout the twentieth century. Over the past decades, several studies have suggested that women and minority groups tend to face lower earning potential than white men, leading to further social problems such as unemployment, poverty, and education dropout. There have also been numerous efforts to address these issues, but more research needs to be done to identify practical solutions that can help alleviate these problems.
