# 1.背景介绍


Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with the automatic extraction, processing, analysis, and interpretation of digital images and videos in order to understand and manipulate them. This involves developing computer algorithms that identify, track, analyze, classify, or interpret features within these objects, which may include visual patterns such as edges, shapes, textures, colors, etc., audible signals such as sounds, music, speech, gestures, etc., or combinations thereof. The core purpose behind computer vision is to automate tasks that are difficult or time-consuming for humans, allowing machines to achieve goals faster than humans can by analyzing and understanding human behavior.
The widespread use of mobile devices has revolutionized our lives through capturing aerial photos, selfies, video recordings, and other multimedia content. Although this data is increasingly being stored digitally, it still remains imperfect due to variations in lighting conditions, image quality, and other factors. Thus, the need for reliable and accurate computer vision tools becomes more urgent than ever. With so many applications in medicine, security, transportation, entertainment, and engineering, computer vision research has been a significant portion of our work over the past decade. In recent years, machine learning techniques have improved the accuracy and efficiency of most computer vision systems, but much of the original research remains unexplored. Moreover, there exists a lack of resources to provide practical guidance on how best to approach each problem and algorithm, especially in the case where multiple approaches exist or even when one is clearly preferred. Therefore, we believe that creating a comprehensive resource guide covering fundamental concepts, problems, and techniques will be essential in advancing the state of the art in computer vision. 

In summary, while computer vision research has progressed significantly over the past decade, there still remain many challenges that must be addressed. To address these issues, we aim to create a comprehensive guide to fundamentals of computer vision, including:

1) A solid foundation in the mathematical foundations of computer vision, including representations, transformations, metrics, and optimization. 

2) An understanding of common computer vision problems, such as object detection, segmentation, tracking, depth estimation, and motion analysis. 

3) A set of principles guiding the selection, design, and evaluation of computer vision algorithms based on their performance, computational complexity, realism, robustness, scalability, effectiveness, and generalizability. 

4) A systematic and organized presentation of relevant literature, including papers from leading journals, conferences, and top-tier AI conferences.

5) A well-structured repository of code examples and tutorials illustrating how to implement various computer vision algorithms using popular programming languages. These should serve as a valuable reference point for practitioners and students alike.

By publishing this guide, we hope to foster discussion between researchers and developers, increase awareness of current trends and developments, and spark new collaborations and partnerships. We also hope that readers and users of computer vision technology will find it helpful and informative. Finally, we would like to thank all those who have contributed to this resource; they have helped shape its contents and philosophy over the years. Let's get started!

# 2.核心概念与联系
This section provides an overview of some important concepts related to computer vision, along with a brief description of their relationship. Some of these terms will be used throughout the rest of the article, and others may only occur once or twice. It is recommended to familiarize yourself with these terms before diving into the details of specific computer vision algorithms. 

## 2.1 Representations
Images and videos can be represented in different ways, depending on the context and the intended use. Common representations include raster (pixel), vector, and tensor formats. Raster formats represent images as two-dimensional arrays of pixel values. Vector formats represent images as geometric primitives such as lines, curves, points, polygons, etc. Tensor formats represent multi-dimensional arrays of data elements. Each representation has strengths and weaknesses, which depend on the desired application and level of detail required. For example, raster formats offer high resolution and good flexibility, while vector formats allow for easy manipulation and transformation of individual objects.

## 2.2 Transformations
Transformations refer to any operation applied to an image or video to alter its appearance or structure. Examples include rotation, scaling, skew, cropping, blurring, and fusion. Transformation operations are commonly used in image processing, computer graphics, medical imaging, and video analysis. They are central to several computer vision algorithms, such as feature detectors, image registration, and panorama stitching. Oftentimes, transforming images into a standard format (e.g. JPEG, PNG, BMP) prior to processing can improve accuracy and reduce computation time.  

## 2.3 Metrics
Metrics define how similar or dissimilar two images or videos are, typically measured by a numerical value. Typical metrics include pixel difference, mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), and histogram intersection loss (HILL). Metrics are central to several computer vision algorithms, such as descriptor matching, supervised classification, anomaly detection, and segmentation. Different metrics can yield subtly different results and require careful tuning to optimize performance.

## 2.4 Optimization
Optimization refers to finding the best parameters or settings for a given task, such as image recognition, object detection, or facial expression recognition. Optimizers can be classified according to their nature (such as gradient descent, evolutionary strategies, or simulated annealing), objective function (such as cross-entropy, mean squared error, or intersection over union), and termination criteria (such as fixed number of iterations, convergence threshold, or elapsed wall clock time). Similarity search and indexing methods rely heavily on optimization algorithms, and good parameter choices can greatly impact their performance. Despite their importance, little attention has been paid to optimization in the broader scope of computer vision.

## 2.5 Kernels
Kernels are small matrices used to apply filters to an image. Common kernel types include low-pass filtering (e.g. Gaussian smoothing), sharpening/edge detection, and morphological operations (dilation, erosion, opening, closing). While kernels can appear seemingly abstract, they are widely used in computer vision and image processing, and represent a powerful tool for enhancing images and extracting information. One example of a convolutional neural network utilizing a kernel is VGGNet, a deep neural network architecture trained on ImageNet dataset.

## 2.6 Features
Features describe distinctive characteristics of an object or scene. These can be detected automatically in an image or computed manually. Popular feature descriptors include SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform), HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients), ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF), CASIA-SURF (Center-Affine Shape Registration Technique), LBP (Local Binary Patterns), Gabor filter bank, and wavelets. They are widely used in computer vision and image processing, and form the basis for many computer vision algorithms.

## 2.7 Segmentation
Segmentation refers to the process of partitioning an image into regions or areas of interest. Segments can correspond to semantic categories, objects, or parts of complex scenes. Two main types of segmentation algorithms are pixel-based (e.g. graph cuts, watershed segmentation) and region-based (e.g. region growing, active contours). Pixel-based methods operate at the pixel level, while region-based methods use shape priors learned from annotated training data. Region-based methods perform better than pixel-based ones on small foreground objects or noise, but can become slower and less accurate as the size of the input increases. Generative models like conditional random fields (CRFs) can be used to model pairwise relationships between pixels, making them suitable for large image segmentations with complex boundaries.
