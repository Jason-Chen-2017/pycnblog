# 1.背景介绍


Probability distributions and moments are important mathematical tools used in statistics for analyzing and modeling data. The distribution of a random variable describes the probabilities with which it can take on various values or states. These probabilities are then used to calculate statistical parameters such as mean, variance, and standard deviation. However, before we get into these concepts let's first discuss what is meant by random variable? In probability theory, a random variable X refers to a variable whose outcomes cannot be predicted beforehand but instead depend on an underlying process that generates the observations. This process is known as a stochastic process and determines how events occur and their order. For example, if we roll a die repeatedly, each outcome is completely independent of all others. Random variables play a crucial role in probability because they allow us to make inferences about the behavior of a system based on its past behavior rather than simply examining its current state.

Now that we have a basic understanding of what a random variable is, let's move onto the main topics of this article: distribution functions and moments. A distribution function specifies the probability density function (PDF) of a given random variable, while a moment represents a particular weighted average of the random variable. We will explore both ideas in detail below. 

# 2. Core Concepts & Connections
## 2.1 Distribution Functions 
The probability density function (PDF) of a continuous random variable X(x), usually denoted f(x), gives the relative likelihood that X takes on any value within a certain range or interval. The PDF must satisfy several properties including non-negativity, normalizing property, symmetry and convexity. Here are some commonly used PDFs:

1. Normal/Gaussian Distribution: If X has a normal distribution, then its PDF is represented by the following equation:

   $f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}\sigma}e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}}$
   
   where $\mu$ is the mean or central tendency of the distribution and $\sigma$ is its standard deviation. 

2. Exponential Distribution: If X has an exponential distribution, then its PDF is represented by the formula:

   $f(x)=\lambda e^{-\lambda x}$
   
   where $\lambda$ is the rate parameter characterizing the exponential distribution. 

3. Uniform Distribution: If X has a uniform distribution between two endpoints a and b, then its PDF is given by:

   $f(x)=\frac{1}{b-a}$

4. Bernoulli Distribution: If X has a Bernoulli distribution, meaning that there are only two possible outcomes, either "success" or "failure", with equal probability p, then its PDF is given by:

   $f(x)=p^{x}(1-p)^{1-x}$ 
   
   Note that the PMF maps every element of the sample space {0, 1} to a corresponding probability [0, 1]. Hence, when working with discrete random variables, we need to use different notation such as P(X=k), etc., whereas for continuous random variables, we work with the PDF directly.  

  All distribution functions must satisfy the four necessary properties mentioned above. If any of them do not hold true, then the distribution is said to be degenerate. Degenerate distributions cannot fully describe the behavior of the random variable and may lead to misleading conclusions.  

To obtain a better idea of how a distribution looks like, we can plot its graph using python libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn. Let's create a simple example of a Gaussian distribution with $\mu = 2$ and $\sigma = 1$. We'll also generate samples from this distribution and compare them to a theoretical normal curve:


```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy import stats

# Generate samples from a normal distribution
mean = 2
std_deviation = 1
samples = np.random.normal(loc=mean, scale=std_deviation, size=1000)

# Create histogram of samples
plt.hist(samples, bins=100)
plt.title('Histogram of Samples')
plt.xlabel('Value')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()

# Plot normal curve
x = np.linspace(-7, 7, num=1000)
y = stats.norm.pdf(x, loc=mean, scale=std_deviation)
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Normal Curve')
plt.xlabel('Value')
plt.ylabel('Density')
plt.show()
```

The left chart shows the histogram of generated samples. It appears quite normally distributed although there seems to be some skewness towards lower values due to the sampling procedure. On the right side, we plotted the theoretical normal curve for comparison. As expected, the normal curve follows the shape of the normal distribution very closely.

It should be noted that the choice of distribution affects the resulting insights and interpretations obtained from the analysis. Therefore, choosing appropriate distributions for specific scenarios is critical. One common mistake is to assume that a variable follows a normal distribution without proper justification or context. Common examples include age, height, income, IQ scores, etc. Other than looking at the raw data, it would be beneficial to analyze the distribution visually using charts, histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and other techniques to gain a deeper insight into the behavior of the data.
