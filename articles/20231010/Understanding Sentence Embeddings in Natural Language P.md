# 1.背景介绍


This article will be a deep-dive into the inner workings of sentence embeddings and how they can be used in natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, textual entailment or machine translation. We'll start by discussing what exactly are these sentence embeddings? What do they capture from sentences that have semantic meaning? How does this affect different NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, textual entailment, machine translation etc.
Let's first understand the basics behind the term'sentence embedding'. It is an embedding vector representation of a sentence that captures its underlying semantics. In simple terms, it represents each word in a sentence using a fixed length vector. 

Sentence embeddings can be useful for several natural language processing (NLP) applications such as:

1. Sentiment Analysis: One common application of sentence embeddings is to classify texts based on their emotional valence. For example, positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
2. Textual Entailment: Another important use case of sentence embeddings is in textual entailment where we need to determine whether one sentence provides more information about another than just confirming the facts stated in both sentences. This task involves comparing two sentences and determining if the former adds any new information to the latter.
3. Machine Translation: A popular area where sentence embeddings are being used is in neural machine translation systems where the goal is to translate text from one language to another without losing the context or tone of the original text. The idea here is to preserve all the necessary information while translating the text between languages.

In this article, I'll discuss various approaches and techniques related to creating and utilizing sentence embeddings in natural language processing tasks.

Before going into details, let me give you some definitions regarding the terminology used below:

- **Word Embedding**: It refers to a mapping of words to vectors that encode semantic relationships between them. Word embeddings are often learned using unsupervised learning algorithms like Skip-gram or CBOW which automatically learn features based on the cooccurrence patterns of words in a large corpus of data. 
- **Document Embedding**: Document embedding is similar to word embedding but instead of individual words, it is created by combining multiple words in a document into a single vector representing the entire document. Documents typically contain more than one sentence so there would also be dependencies among sentences within a document.
- **Sentence Embedding**: Finally, sentence embedding combines the ideas of word and document embeddings to create a fixed size vector that encodes the overall meaning of a sentence regardless of its position in a document. It uses a combination of techniques like averaging, maximum, or LSTM (Long Short Term Memory Networks). Sentence embedding has been widely used in various NLP applications including sentiment analysis, textual entailment, machine translation, and question answering.

# 2. Core Concepts & Contact
## 2.1 Gensim Library
Gensim is a Python library used to generate and process natural language understanding models. It includes a range of pre-trained models along with tools for training custom models. In order to install gensim, please run the following command in your terminal/command prompt:<|im_sep|>|<|im_sep|>|<|im_sep|>|<|im_sep|>|im_sep|>
    pip install gensim
We will be using gensim’s “Doc2Vec” model to create our sentence embeddings. Doc2Vec algorithm creates vectors for documents in a continuous space where distance between any two vectors reflects similarity between corresponding documents. The distance metric used in doc2vec is cosine similarity.

## 2.2 Prerequisites
To get started with working with sentence embeddings, we need to understand some fundamental concepts and libraries used in modern NLP such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, NLTK, Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Matplotlib. Here's a quick summary of those prerequisites before we dive into the actual topic of creating and using sentence embeddings in NLP tasks. 

1. TensorFlow: TensorFlow is a powerful and flexible open source machine learning framework designed to research and develop complex neural networks. TensorFlow allows us to build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly and efficiently.
2. PyTorch: PyTorch is a machine learning library built on top of the Torch library and offers easy-to-use abstractions for building neural networks. It supports dynamic computational graphs, CUDA acceleration, automatic differentiation, and parallelism across multiple GPUs. 
3. NLTK: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to perform diverse NLP tasks such as tokenization, stemming, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis.
4. Scikit-learn: Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library written in Python that aims to provide efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling. It contains many built-in functions for performing data preprocessing, feature extraction, classification, clustering, and visualization.
5. Keras: Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. Keras was developed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks and to support researchers in designing novel architectures.
6. Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It provides MATLAB-like plotting functionalities through its object-oriented interface.
