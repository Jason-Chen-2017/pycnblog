# 1.背景介绍


Fine-grained visual categorization(FGVC) is a challenging problem in computer vision that requires understanding of fine-grained differences between objects from different categories and contexts. In this paper, we propose an effective approach called contrastive learning to address the challenge in FGVC task by using only image data. We first introduce a self-supervised learning method, SimCLR, which pretrains models on large-scale unlabelled datasets with strong augmentation techniques to learn representations of both images and their corresponding textual descriptions. Then, we use these learned representations as inputs to a simple linear classifier or a deep neural network, trained end-to-end, to perform classification tasks. The proposed approach significantly outperforms previous methods by achieving significant improvements on several benchmarks in FGVC task including CUB, AWA2, SUN and AwA. 

In this work, we explore how to effectively utilize the learned representation in a supervised setting instead of solely relying on weak labels provided during training. Specifically, we show that contrastive learning can be utilized effectively to improve performance of FGVC classifiers by constructing discriminative pairs from different domains. To further enhance the robustness of our model, we also employ cross entropy loss for better alignment of the representations across different classes. Overall, the contribution of this work lies in providing insights into contrastive learning based approaches for addressing FGVC task efficiently and effectively.

Contrastive learning (CL), one type of self-supervised learning technique, was originally introduced in SimCLR in 2020 [1]. CL explores two views of the same input and aims at reducing the redundancy in information present in it. It consists of two components: a projection head that projects high-dimensional features into low-dimensional space and a similarity function that measures whether two samples are similar or not. Samples that are deemed more similar will have lower distances when compared against each other in this space. 

The main idea behind CL for FGVC is to train a feature extractor without any supervision using only the input images. This allows us to capture useful semantic features that are invariant to different domain variations. These extracted features can then be used as inputs to a downstream classifier that takes into account the context information provided through additional textual description annotations associated with them. With appropriate selection of suitable representation layers, we can directly leverage the learned features in a supervised manner rather than relying solely on weak label annotations. 

Our proposed contrastive learning approach is built upon recent advances in unsupervised representation learning and self-supervised learning. One specific aspect of our work that stands out is the careful exploration of how multiple modalities such as images and textual descriptions can benefit each other in improving the overall quality of the resulting features. Similarity functions that rely on correlation instead of distance measurements, such as dot product or cosine similarity, have been shown to provide higher accuracy results in some cases. However, these methods do not take into account all relevant information in the input and hence may miss out on essential aspects of the underlying distributions. Therefore, while designing the similarity metric, we need to balance the trade-off between capturing informative features versus focusing too much on raw pixel values alone. Finally, incorporating cross-entropy loss in addition to conventional loss functions like softmax/cross-entropy has proven beneficial for class imbalance problems and leads to improved generalization performance.

Now let's go deeper into the detailed technical details of the contrastive learning algorithm for FGVC. Here's what we'll cover:

1. Self-Supervised Pretraining
Before building a CNN-based FGVC classifier, we first train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using only image data and apply various data augmentation techniques to generate pseudo-labeled data. 

2. Projection Heads and Pair Selection Strategy
Next, we construct a projection head that maps the high-dimensional feature vectors generated by the CNN back onto a smaller subspace, where similarity calculations can be performed efficiently. We then use a similarity function to measure the pairwise similarity between the embeddings of the input image pairs. There are many ways to select positive and negative pairs for training, but we choose to use anchor-positive pairs and anchor-negative pairs strategy commonly used in metric learning literature.

3. Downstream Classifier Training
We feed the selected image embeddings to a fully connected layer followed by dropout regularization to reduce overfitting and output predictions. During training, we optimize the parameters of the entire architecture jointly using stochastic gradient descent.

Here's a brief overview of the key operations involved in the above steps:

1. Data Augmentation Techniques: Random cropping, random flipping, color jittering etc.

2. Anchor-Positive Pair Selection: For each batch of input images, we randomly sample one of them as the "anchor" image. We then iterate through the remaining images until we find another image that is sufficiently distant from the anchor in terms of cosine similarity between its embedding and the embedding of the anchor image. We include this distant image as part of the positive pair and the anchor image as the negative example.

3. Cosine Similarity Loss Function: The cosine similarity measurement captures the degree of similarity between two embedding vectors. Higher cosine similarities indicate greater likelihood of the two images being positively paired together, whereas lower similarities indicate a lack of similarity. Cross-entropy loss is added alongside standard binary cross-entropy loss so that the weightage of the losses can be tuned separately for the different classes.

4. Gradient Descent Optimization: Stochastic gradient descent optimization is used to minimize the total loss by updating the weights of the neural networks in the direction that minimizes the objective function. We use ADAM optimizer for faster convergence.
