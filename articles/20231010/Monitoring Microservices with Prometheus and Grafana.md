# 1.背景介绍


In this article we will discuss monitoring microservices with Prometheus and Grafana in detail. We assume that the reader is familiar with Kubernetes and microservices architecture. If not, please read some introductory materials before continuing the reading of this article.
Microservices are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to deliver small components or services independently. In a distributed environment, these small, independent services need to be monitored closely to detect any performance issues, availability problems, and usage trends. Monitoring also helps in identifying root cause for issues by collecting logs from different sources such as application logs, system metrics, and infrastructure metrics. The key objective here is to identify and isolate issues quickly so that they can be addressed efficiently without causing any downtime to the entire system. 

One of the popular open source solutions for monitoring microservices is Prometheus and Grafana. Prometheus provides a time-series database that stores metrics in real-time, allowing us to monitor different aspects of our applications. It supports several programming languages including Java, Python, Go, Ruby, etc., making it easy to integrate with microservices. Grafana on the other hand, allows us to visualize collected data through various charts, graphs, and dashboards. This makes it easier for stakeholders to analyze and understand how our systems are performing over time.

In this article, we will discuss how we can set up a basic monitoring solution using Prometheus and Grafana for our microservices deployment. We will cover installation, configuration, and troubleshooting steps along with an overview of various use cases where Prometheus and Grafana can help us to better manage our microservice ecosystem.

 # 2.Core Concepts and Connections
Prometheus and Grafana are two powerful open source projects that work together to provide a complete solution for monitoring microservices. Here's a brief summary of what each project does:
## Prometheus (Time-Series Database)
Prometheus is an open-source software tool used for event monitoring and alerting. It’s based on a pull model, which means that instead of pushing metrics to its clients, Prometheus collects them from instrumented jobs every fixed interval. Metrics are stored in a time-series database called a Time Series Database (TSDB), which allows efficient querying and analysis of historical metric data. 

To ensure high availability and reliability, Prometheus has multiple redundant instances running behind load balancers or service meshes. This way, if one instance fails, another takes over automatically without affecting the overall functionality of the system. Prometheus has built-in support for cluster management tools like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Consul, etc., enabling users to deploy Prometheus as part of their platform.

## Grafana (Visualization Tool)
Grafana is a web-based visualization tool commonly used for displaying time-series data. It allows you to create dynamic dashboards with visualizations such as line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, tables, and more. You can connect Grafana to Prometheus directly, or use Grafana plugins to query data from other databases such as InfluxDB and Elasticsearch.

When working with microservices, Grafana enables you to slice and dice your metrics data at different levels such as service, host, pod, container level. With Grafana, you can easily see resource utilization, response times, error rates, and other important metrics across your whole microservices environment. By analyzing the patterns and behavior of metrics data, you can identify potential bottlenecks and improve system performance.

## Summary
In conclusion, both Prometheus and Grafana play significant roles in monitoring microservices effectively. Prometheus provides a time-series database that stores metrics in real-time, while Grafana offers a robust visualization tool for displaying and analyzing metrics data. Combining these two tools, we can build effective monitoring solutions for our microservices deployments.

Now let's move on to explore Prometheus and Grafana further in more details and discuss how we can configure and install them for our microservices deployment. Let's start with installing Prometheus.

# Install Prometheus
Installing Prometheus requires setting up a Prometheus server and optionally configuring exporters to scrape metrics from external sources. Here's how we can do it:

 ## Step 1 - Install Prometheus Server

 Next, navigate to the bin folder inside the extracted directory and run the prometheus binary file to launch the Prometheus server.

   ```
  ./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
   ```
   
  Note: Make sure you have Prometheus.yml file under the same directory. Otherwise, add "--config.file=<path>" option while running prometheus command. 
   
 If everything runs smoothly, you should see the following message in the terminal:
   ```
   level=info ts=2020-09-17T12:09:53.275Z caller=main.go:337 msg="Server is ready to receive web requests."
   ```

 ## Step 2 - Configure Exporters
 Prometheus needs to know where to find the targets to be scraped. These targets could be applications being monitored, infrastructure servers, and cloud resources. We can define these targets in a YAML file named "prometheus.yaml". 

  For example, suppose we want to monitor a sample app deployed on port 8080 on localhost. In the prometheus.yaml file, we would add the following config:

  ```
  global:
      scrape_interval:     15s 
      evaluation_interval: 15s 
  scrape_configs:
      - job_name:'sample' 
        static_configs:
          - targets: ['localhost:8080']  
  ```
  
  Here, we've defined a single job named "sample" that contains a list of targets to be scraped. Each target consists of an IP address or hostname followed by a port number. We've chosen to scrape the local machine on port 8080 only. 

 ## Troubleshoot Common Issues 
 ### Error: listen tcp :9090: bind: address already in use 
 In case you're seeing an error similar to the above when trying to launch Prometheus, it indicates that there's already a process listening on the default HTTP API port of 9090. You'll need to either shut down the conflicting process or specify a custom port for Prometheus via the `--web.listen-address` flag when starting the process. Alternatively, you can change the `global.scrape_port` value in your `prometheus.yaml` file to use a non-default port.

 ### Error: no matches found: postgres://user:password@host:port/database
 When trying to scrape a Postgres database, make sure the URL specified in your `prometheus.yaml` file is valid. There may be a typo or missing parameter.
