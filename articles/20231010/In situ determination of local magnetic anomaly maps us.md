# 1.背景介绍


The development of advanced electronics and microelectronic devices requires the acquisition and processing of large amounts of data for research and development purposes. One area that has experienced this increase in demand is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. MRI is widely used to obtain detailed structural information from tissues, especially brain tissue, which can provide valuable insights into neurological diseases or cognitive processes in individuals with disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, conventional MR schemes rely on radio frequency (RF) pulse sequences and require long acquisition times, which may limit their use cases in clinical practice and for screening tumors early before they become malignant. To overcome these limitations, we need an in-situ non-conventional technique that allows us to image small volumes at high spatial resolution without relying on RF pulses.
Magnetorheological technique offers a solution to address these requirements by utilizing a continuous flow of focused ultra-high energy magnets inside the patient body through an axial direction, thereby producing an image of the internal structures at submicrometer scale with high temporal resolution. Magnetorheography uses dynamic position control (DPC) to establish a series of controlled focus movements within the patient's body, allowing us to generate images of various sizes and shapes. Within each individual field of view, magnetic resonance fluctuations are measured directly at the surface of the magnetization coils, creating a three-dimensional (3D) map of the local magnetic fields. The resulting 3D magnetic field maps offer significant advantages compared to traditional 2D methods in terms of both spatial and temporal resolutions. Moreover, by including all major blood vessels and organs in the image volume, it enables direct visualization of disease progression and tumor heterogeneity throughout the body. In conclusion, while there have been many successful applications of MR techniques for medical imaging, in-situ MRI remains a challenging yet exciting technology due to its unique capabilities and potential impact on healthcare systems.
However, to create reliable and accurate in-situ magnetic resonance maps of a complex organ like the human brain, several technical challenges still remain. These include low contrast agent availability, low spatial resolution, limited realism, and the requirement to visualize multiple organs simultaneously. While some solutions exist for improving the contrast agent density, low spatial resolution, and reduced visual realism, incorporating biomechanical models into the image formation process can help reduce artifacts and enhance the accuracy of the acquired magnetic field maps. Furthermore, with the advent of machine learning algorithms, it will be possible to develop fully automated tools that automatically segment and quantify the organs involved in the image volume, making it even more efficient and accurate than manual interpretation. Overall, the introduction of magnetorheography-based in-situ imaging opens up a new era of innovative medical technologies that promise to advance our understanding of physiology, pathophysiology, and treatment options in the brains of living humans.

In-situ magnetic resonance imaging involves generating 3D magnetic field maps of internal organs and tissues using dynamic position control (DPC), a technique based on magnetorheology. Dynamic position control is used to establish a series of controlled focus movements within the patient’s body, allowing us to generate images of various sizes and shapes. Each individual field of view contains magnetic resonance measurements captured directly at the surface of the magnetization coils, creating a three-dimensional (3D) map of the local magnetic fields. Here are brief descriptions of important concepts related to in-situ magnetic resonance imaging:

1. Magnetic Field Map: A 3D magnetic field map consists of two parts - the magnetic field intensity (B) and the orientation of the magnetic field (H). B represents the strength of the magnetic field at any point in space and H indicates how that field is oriented. For example, B could represent the magnitude of magnetization within the coil, and H could indicate whether the magnetization points towards the left or right side of the axis of symmetry. 

2. DPC: Dynamic Position Control refers to the method of controlling the movement of the magnets within the coil during the imaging process. DPC provides precision control over the placement of magnets and ensures that only the desired areas are being imaged accurately. It does so by dynamically adjusting the length of the magnetic field gradient produced by the coil. By varying the speed and trajectory of the magnets' motion, we can achieve precise alignment between the axes of the coil and the plane of interest in the subject's body. DPC relies heavily on fluid dynamics principles and mathematical modeling of electromagnetic phenomena.

3. Patient Model: A patient model is a simplified representation of a particular organ or tissue in the subject's body, consisting primarily of geometrical surfaces and boundary conditions. A patient model simplifies the complexity of the actual tissue and improves the efficiency and accuracy of the image creation process. Patients typically require less resources and time to create a 3D magnetic field map compared to imaging the entire organ.

To summarize, magnetorheological techniques allow for the generation of 3D magnetic field maps of internal organs and tissues at submicrometer scales, providing high temporal and spatial resolutions. They enable visualization of patients who cannot tolerate conventional radiofrequency pulse sequences, such as those needed for MRI scans. In addition, integrated biomechanical models improve the quality and reliability of the image, reducing artifactual effects and ensuring accurate quantification of organs involved in the image. Machine learning algorithms further automate the process of segmentation and quantification, making it easier and faster to analyze large datasets.

3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
Before diving deeper into the specific implementation details of magnetorheographic imaging, let’s understand how magnetorheology works in general. Understanding how magnetization changes occurring in the magnetic environment affects the magnetic field created by the coils is crucial for in-situ imaging using magnetorheology.

Magnetization is a quantum mechanical property of matter that can exist either in an ordered state called ferromagnetic or an unordered state called antiferromagnetic. Ferromagnetic materials exhibit strong interactions among their constituent atoms and are thus highly magnetized; whereas, antiferromagnetic materials exhibit weak interactions and are less magnetized. When a material experiences an external magnetic field, it reorganizes itself into one of these states, altering the distribution of atomic spins along its lattice structure. This change in spin state is called magnetization. 

When a ferromagnetic material is placed in an applied magnetic field, the magnetization within the material naturally aligns with the direction of the applied field. As a result, there is no net magnetic moment generated around the center of the coil. On the other hand, when an antiferromagnetic material is in contact with a magnetic field, it forms regions of uniformly magnetized saturation in different directions. Accordingly, there is a net magnetic moment generated around the center of the coil. Thus, under ideal conditions, magnetorheological imaging produces a spatial map of the magnetic field within the body, where the magnetization is aligned with the direction of propagation of the applied field.

Now that you know what magnetization means, let’s look at how magnetorheology works in detail. Magnetorheology involves applying a constant current to a thin film of porous polymer material known as the core. Inside the core, hundreds to thousands of closely packed parallel arrays of polarizable magnets (also known as helical fields) are arranged radially, approximately one millimeter apart, and perpendicular to the direction of magnetization. These magnets interact with incoming electric and magnetic fields, altering the shape of the magnetic field lines passing through them, causing a variation in the magnetic flux density (BFD). The resulting magnetic field gradients produce a focused beam of X-rays, also referred to as the probe beam, which passes through the innermost layer of the core.

Next, the X-ray beam travels through a sample region surrounding the core, where a secondary electron gun generates alternating plasma currents that propagate through the sample region. This process results in the formation of focused magnetic beams that pass through the sample. The magnetic beams are focused onto a sensitive detection objective, which detects the presence of scattered x-rays indicating localized areas of the magnetic field. The size and shape of these detected regions determine the strength and orientation of the magnetic field components present within the sample region.

During the imaging process, the axial location of the focused magnetic beams is adjusted using a computer-controlled system known as the Dynamic Position Controller (DPC). This controller regulates the position of the magnets relative to the transducer, thereby directing the magnetic field beams toward areas of interest within the patient’s body. During the DPC cycle, the sample moves downward through a range of positions ranging from the bottom of the core to the top of the body, creating an image volume with high temporal and spatial resolutions.

Magnetorheographic imaging is widely used for various medical applications, including neurological diagnosis, brain tumor screening, and medicine education. Its utility lies in its ability to capture the spatial and temporal variations of the local magnetic fields within the body, enabling precise diagnoses and therapeutic interventions. However, in order to obtain high-quality images with submicrometer spatial resolution, a number of key factors must be considered and addressed, including:

1. Contrast Agent Availability: The amount of contrast agent required to obtain a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the detection channel determines the degree of artifact suppression and increases the sensitivity of the detectors. Optimal contrast agent densities depend on the distance and angle of the objectives, the thickness of the skin layers involved, and the level of intraoperative contrast administration. Therefore, it is essential to select appropriate contrast agents that meet the needs of the application at hand.

2. Spatial Resolution: Magnetorheographic imaging is capable of obtaining submicrometer spatial resolution, but only if the objectives are appropriately designed and calibrated. Specifically, the design of the transducers should be optimized for minimum object impedances, maximum SNR, and stability. In addition, different types of objects require different approaches to increasing the spatial resolution of the image. Non-uniformities in the thickness, curvature, and gaps between optically active regions can affect the effective resolution.

3. Realistic Visualization: The choice of imaging modality and depth of field effectively limits the degree to which the imagined object appears closer to the user versus farther away. If the aim is to visualize fine structures and detailed anatomy, increased depth of field may not always be necessary, but higher contrast agent concentrations may be required. Conversely, if the goal is simply to appreciate overall morphological features and outlines, the depth of field and the amount of contrast agent should be kept relatively low to minimize distractions and false positives.

4. Multi-Organ Imaging: In certain applications involving multiple organs, such as neurological diagnosis or endocrinology, multi-organ imaging can significantly increase the fidelity and clarity of the obtained images. Multiple views of the same field of view enable the identification of multiple pathological states within the same patient, making it difficult to make independent diagnostic or therapeutic decisions.

5. Biomechanical Models: Incorporating biomechanical models into the image formation process helps reduce artifacts and enhances the accuracy of the acquired magnetic field maps. Different biomechanical models predict different patterns of magnetic fields that occur within the coil due to the elastic deformation of the underlying tissue. By correcting for the deviation of predicted magnetic fields from the observed ones, the added value of biomechanical corrections becomes apparent.

6. Segmentation Algorithms: Accurate and robust segmentation algorithms are critical to ensure that only the relevant information is included in the final image volume. Standard segmentation methods, such as thresholding and watershed algorithms, work well for most in-situ imaging tasks, but do not perform well when applied to magnetic resonance imaging. Instead, novel segmentation techniques must be developed specifically for the task of image segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging.

Conclusion: Magnetorheographic imaging provides in-situ non-conventional imaging capability that promises to transform the way we approach medical procedures and treatments. By developing customized hardware and software platforms, addressing the above mentioned technical challenges, and integrating artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, we can develop powerful in-situ imaging machines that can deliver unprecedented levels of realism, accuracy, and performance in near-real time.
