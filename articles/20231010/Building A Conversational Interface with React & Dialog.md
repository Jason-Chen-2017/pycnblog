# 1.背景介绍


Dialogflow is a popular conversational AI platform that allows developers to create chatbots and voice assistants. It enables developers to build applications with natural language conversations without needing to understand the nuances of speech recognition or natural language processing (NLP). The Dialogflow Platform provides tools for building bots and integrating them into messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger, Slack, Skype, etc. One of its core features is an API that can be used by developers to integrate their application with dialogues based on user input. 

In this article we will see how to use React JS framework alongside with Dialogflow API to build a chatbot interface using a simple FAQ bot as an example. We’ll also discuss about some important concepts related to Dialogflow such as entities, intents, training phrases and fulfillment responses. Additionally, we’ll provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to setup your development environment and deploy your chatbot to Dialogflow so that it can interact with users in real time.


This article assumes knowledge of JavaScript programming, basic understanding of HTML, CSS and ReactJS frameworks. If you are not familiar with these technologies please refer to other resources available online before proceeding further.

# 2.核心概念与联系
Let's take a look at the following terms and concepts which play a crucial role in building a conversational interface: 

1. Dialogflow:
Dialogflow is a cloud-based NLP tool that allows developers to design, test, and manage chatbots and conversational interfaces. Its core feature is an API that developers can use to easily connect their applications with conversation based inputs.

2. Agent:
An agent in Dialogflow represents the entity responsible for maintaining the intelligence of the chatbot and managing all the conversations between users and the chatbot. Each agent contains several intents and training phrases which help it identify what kind of queries the user wants answered and what action should be taken accordingly.

3. Intent:
Intent refers to the purpose or goal expressed in a user query. It describes what actions or information the user requires. In Dialogflow, each agent has multiple intents associated with it. Each intent corresponds to one task or action that the chatbot should perform when it receives a certain type of input from the user. For instance, if our chatbot handles reservation booking requests, there would be different intents defined for different types of queries such as "Make a Reservation", "Cancel my Reservation" and so on. 

4. Entity:
Entities represent the subject matter of a user query. They help classify or categorize the information requested by the user. For example, if the user asks for a movie recommendation, the entity could be "movie name". In Dialogflow, entities can be created manually or automatically using machine learning algorithms.

5. Training Phrase:
Training phrases are the sample utterances or questions that the chatbot uses to learn new intents and entities. When a user asks a question that matches any of the training phrases assigned to a particular intent, the chatbot will interpret it as a specific request and respond accordingly.  

6. Fulfillment Response:
Fulfillment response is the message that the chatbot sends back to the user after successfully processing the user's query. This can include text messages, images, videos, audio files, buttons, menus, suggestions, or card attachments. Depending on the nature of the bot, the appropriate type of response may need to be chosen depending on the context of the conversation. For instance, in a restaurant reservation chatbot, the chatbot might send confirmation emails to the customer confirming their reservation details.

To develop a conversational interface using React JS and Dialogflow, we need to follow the below steps:

1. Create a Dialogflow account and project
Firstly, we need to sign up for a Dialogflow account and create a new project. Once done, we can add Intents, Entities, Training Phrases, Fulfillment Responses and many more to customize our chatbot as per our requirements.

2. Install React JS and necessary packages
Next, we need to install React JS framework and additional packages required for our application. These packages will help us handle state management, routing, form submission and other tasks required to build our chatbot interface. 

3. Set up Dialogflow web client
Once we have installed React JS and configured our Dialogflow credentials, we need to set up our web client by adding our chatbot URL to the Dialogflow console. By doing this, our chatbot will start receiving incoming requests through Dialogflow API.

4. Define User Actions and Dialog Flow
Now comes the main part where we define our Chatbot UI using JSX and React components. Here, we'll map out the user flow using a state variable and render appropriate components based on the current state. To make the interface interactive, we'll attach event handlers to various components and update the state accordingly. During this process, we'll also register our intents and mapping them to corresponding training phrases within the Dialogflow Console.

5. Connect Components to Dialogflow API
After defining our chatbot UI, we need to establish a connection between our frontend code and the Dialogflow API. We do this by creating an Authorization token that includes our secret key generated during the creation of our Dialogflow Project.

6. Handle Incoming Requests
When a user submits a query to our chatbot via the Dialogflow platform, the system forwards the query to our backend server, which processes the query and returns a suitable response. We then forward the response back to the user over the Dialogflow platform.

7. Deploy Application to Cloud Platform
Finally, once everything is working correctly, we can deploy our chatbot interface to a cloud hosting service like Firebase Hosting, Heroku, AWS S3 or Google App Engine. With proper configuration of DNS records and SSL certificates, our chatbot will be accessible through various messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Telegram, Skype and others.


Therefore, the above mentioned approach involves four main parts - Creating a Dialogflow Account, Installing Required Packages, Defining User Actions and Handling Incoming Requests, and Finally Deploying Our Application. Let's now dive deeper into each of these parts to get a better understanding of how they work together.


Creating a Dialogflow Account and Project
Before creating a new project, ensure that you have signed up for a free trial version of Dialogflow. Once logged in, go to the Projects section and click on New Project. Provide a unique Name for your project and select the Language as English. Select Region as US or Europe and finally click on Create Project button. After successful creation of the project, you will land on the Overview page of your project dashboard.


Installing Required Packages
Install React JS package along with other dependencies required for your application. Ensure that you are running Node Version Manager and Yarn Package manager. You can check the latest versions of both by typing the following commands in your terminal:

nvm --version && npm --version && yarn --version

Once confirmed, run the following command to install React, ReactDOM, ReactRouterDom packages and Bootstrap library.

npm i react@latest react-dom@latest react-router-dom bootstrap@latest

After installing the required packages, open your editor of choice and create a new file named index.js inside a folder called src. Then import React, ReactDOM and ReactDOMServer libraries and render your app component inside the root element. Also, import BrowserRouter instead of HashRouter to enable browser history support. Make sure to export the App component as default export. Your index.js file should look something like this:

```javascript
import React from'react';
import ReactDOM from'react-dom';
import {BrowserRouter} from'react-router-dom';

// Import your App Component here
import App from './components/App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>, 
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Setting Up Dialogflow Web Client
Open your Dialogflow console and navigate to the Settings tab. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and copy the value displayed under the “Access Token” field. Navigate back to your index.html file and paste the access token inside a meta tag with attribute name “dialogflow-access-token”.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>My Chatbot</title>
  <!-- Add Meta Tag -->
  <meta name="dialogflow-access-token" content="{ACCESS_TOKEN}">
  <!-- Import styles and scripts here... -->
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

Here, replace `{ACCESS_TOKEN}` with the actual access token obtained earlier. Restart your local server to apply changes and refresh the webpage to view the chatbot UI.


Defining User Actions and Dialog Flow
Create a new folder named `components` inside your src directory. Within this folder, create two subfolders - `ChatbotUI` and `Pages`. Within `ChatbotUI`, create three separate files named `Header`, `Footer` and `InputBox`. Next, import Header and InputBox components into your Homepage component and pass props to display them on screen. Render Footer component below the InputBox component.

```jsx
// components/Home/index.js
import React from'react';
import Header from '../ChatbotUI/Header';
import InputBox from '../ChatbotUI/InputBox';
import Footer from '../ChatbotUI/Footer';

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <>
      {/* Display header component */}
      <Header title="My Chatbot" subtitle="Ask me anything..." />

      {/* Display input box component */}
      <InputBox placeholder="What can I do for you today?" />

      {/* Display footer component */}
      <Footer />
    </>
  )
};

export default Home;
```

Implement logic to handle user input and generate output using Dialogflow API. Establish a connection with the Dialogflow API by generating an authorization token containing your secret key. Use the Dialogflow SDK to send user input queries to Dialogflow API and retrieve responses in JSON format. Parse the response data and implement functionality to display output to the user. Register your intents and mapping them to training phrases within the Dialogflow Console. Attach event handlers to various components and update the state accordingly.

Deploy Application to Cloud Platform
Follow the deployment guide provided by Dialogflow to deploy your application to the desired cloud platform. Verify the deployment was successful by accessing the deployed link. Configure DNS settings and SSL certificates to make your chatbot live and accessible through various messaging platforms.
