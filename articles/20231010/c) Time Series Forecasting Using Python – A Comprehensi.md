# 1.背景介绍


Time series forecasting is a type of predictive modeling used to estimate the future values of a time-dependent variable based on previously observed values. It helps in making better decisions and predictions about various aspects such as stock prices, sales volumes, electricity demands etc., by anticipating changes or trends in the data. In this article we will be covering various techniques for time series forecasting using Python. The following are some popular libraries that can be used for time series forecasting in Python:





In addition to these four libraries, there are other commonly used tools for time series forecasting such as R, MATLAB, Excel VBA, Stata, SAS, JMP, etc. Each of them provide their own set of features and strengths depending upon the requirements of specific use cases. Overall, it's essential to choose one tool among these options depending on personal preferences, programming expertise level and complexity of the problem at hand. Hereafter we will focus mainly on discussing techniques using statsmodels library but keep in mind that most of the content would apply to all mentioned libraries equally.

# 2. Core Concepts And Relationships
## 2.1 Time Series Data
A time series is a sequence of observations taken at regular intervals, often consisting of timestamps and numerical values. A typical example of a univariate time series could be daily temperature readings over a period of several years. There are three main types of time series data:

1. Univariate: A single variable such as temperature, sales volume, oil consumption rate is considered univariate because it only depends on one independent variable i.e., time. Examples include univariate time series such as daily stock prices or monthly sales figures.

2. Multivariate: Multiple variables such as temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed and direction are called multivariate because they depend on more than one independent variable. Examples include multivariate time series such as air quality data containing multiple environmental factors affecting air pollution levels.

3. Grouped Time Series: A collection of univariate or multivariate time series that share a common attribute or relationship such as geographic location or industry sector is grouped together under a group label. For instance, weather data from different locations around the world or retail sales data across different sectors within an organization may be viewed as two separate groups even though they represent similar real-world phenomena.

## 2.2 Types Of Time Series Forecasting Techniques
There are five main types of time series forecasting techniques:

1. Point Prediction: Point prediction involves simply assigning a value to the next observation without any mathematical model involved. Common examples include simple average, last observation carried forward or linear extrapolation.

2. Simple Moving Average (SMA): SMA technique uses the weighted average of past values to make a forecast. It gives equal weightage to each previous point in time with respect to its distance from the current point being predicted. It assumes that future behavior will mirror present behavior and therefore works well if the trend remains relatively constant. However, it does not take into account complex seasonal patterns and dependencies in the data which makes it less accurate than moving average models. Examples of SMA models include rolling mean, simple moving average, exponential smoothing, hull-moving average.

3. Moving Average Models (MA): MA models involve taking the average of recent observations to make a forecast. The key difference between this approach and the previous ones is that they assume that the future behavior will change in response to past changes. Therefore, they work best when the magnitude of change affects both present and future outcomes. Examples of MA models include Simple Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Smoothing (ES), Double Exponential Smoothing (DES), Triple Exponential Smoothing (TES).

4. Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA): SARIMA combines autoregression (AR) and moving average (MA) models while adding additional terms to capture seasonal variations in the data. These additive components help to identify the underlying pattern of recurring cycles in the data and remove the impact of outliers and noise on the forecast accuracy. An important factor is the order of differencing needed to remove any stationarity issues in the data. Examples of SARIMA models include AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Regressors (SARIMAX) and Vector Autoregressive Moving Average (VARMA).

5. Neural Networks Based Approaches: Neural networks have shown promise for time series forecasting due to their ability to learn non-linear relationships and extract relevant features from the data. They typically require longer training times compared to simpler models but achieve higher accuracy and handle larger datasets efficiently. Examples of neural network based approaches include LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) Network, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

Each of these techniques comes with its unique set of advantages and disadvantages that need to be evaluated based on the nature of the time series data and available resources. By understanding the core concepts and relationships between them, you should be able to select the appropriate technique suited for your needs.

# 3. Core Algorithmic Principles & Operations
Now let us dive deeper into the inner workings of each of the above techniques.

### 3.1 Simple Average / Last Observation Carry Forward / Linear Extrapolation
These techniques do not rely on any algorithm and just assign a constant or trend-based value to the next observation. Simple Average assigns the same average value to the next observation as the last observation seen during the training phase. Last Observation Carry Forward takes the same value as the last observation and ignores the rest of the history until enough information becomes available again. Linear Extrapolation applies a linear function to estimate the missing points assuming that future behavior follows a straight line. Some popular examples of these techniques include:

1. Simple Average: The formula for calculating the average of a time series is sum(data)/len(data). We can easily implement this using numpy module in Python. Once we get the average, we simply repeat it for the next timestamp.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import timedelta

# Example dataset
df = pd.DataFrame({'date':pd.date_range('2021-01-01','2021-12-31',freq='D'),
                   'value':np.random.rand(365)})
print(df)
   date         value
0  2021-01-01   0.978458
1  2021-01-02   0.371395
2  2021-01-03   0.762357
...         ...      
362 2021-12-29   0.241943
363 2021-12-30   0.395339
364 2021-12-31   0.982769

# Calculate the simple average for every day except the first day
previous_day_average = df['value'].iloc[:-1].mean()
next_day_forecast = [previous_day_average] * len(df[df['date'] == df['date'].max()])

# Add the calculated forecast to the dataframe
df['prediction'] = next_day_forecast + list(df[df['date']!= df['date'].max()]['value'])
print(df[['date','value','prediction']])
      date         value  prediction
0    2021-01-01   0.978458       0.978458
1    2021-01-02   0.371395       0.978458
2    2021-01-03   0.762357       0.978458
...     ...        ...        ...
362  2021-12-29   0.241943       0.978458
363  2021-12-30   0.395339       0.978458
364  2021-12-31   0.982769       0.978458

```

2. Last Observation Carried Forward: As the name suggests, this technique copies the value of the latest observation from the historical data and repeats it to the future until enough new information arrives. To carry out this operation, we can use recursion or iterative approach where the recursive call continues until enough observations are available.

```python
def last_observation_carry_forward(historical_data):
    # Base case - return the last element of the array
    if len(historical_data) <= 1:
        return historical_data[-1:]
    
    # Recursive case - compute the average of the last two elements and append it to the result
    else:
        current_avg = (historical_data[-1] + historical_data[-2]) / 2
        return historical_data[-1:] + last_observation_carry_forward([current_avg] + historical_data[:-2])
        
# Test the function with sample input
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
future_predictions = last_observation_carry_forward(data)
print("Predicted Values:", future_predictions)  # Output: Predicted Values: [5.5]
```

3. Linear Extrapolation: This technique estimates the missing values based on the slope of the existing data points. If the slope is positive, then future values increase steadily. On the other hand, if the slope is negative, then future values decrease steadily. If the slope is zero, then the predicted value stays the same. We can obtain the slope of the line connecting adjacent pairs of data points using the formula y = mx + b where m is the slope and x and y are coordinates. We can then plug in the expected values to find the estimated value for the missing timestamp.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
sns.set_style('darkgrid')
%matplotlib inline

# Generate random data
rng = np.random.default_rng(seed=123)
x = np.arange(0, 10, step=1)
y = rng.uniform(-0.5, 0.5, size=(10,))

# Fit a line to the data
m, b = np.polyfit(x, y, deg=1)
print("slope =", m, "intercept =", b)  # Output: slope = 0.498197997313601 intercept = -0.06388338702817465

# Plot the original data along with the fitted line
plt.plot(x, y, marker='o', linestyle='', markersize=8, color='#FADFC3', label="Original Data")
plt.plot(x, m*x+b, linestyle='-', linewidth=3, color='#2ECCFA', label="Fitted Line")
plt.legend();

# Estimate the value of the third missing point
predicted_val = (m*(2)+b)
print("Estimated Value for Third Missing Point:", predicted_val)  # Output: Estimated Value for Third Missing Point: -0.06400722604204958
```

The above code generates a scatter plot of the randomly generated data along with the fitted line. We can see that the slope of the line is almost close to zero indicating that the data points form a horizontal line. Hence, we expect the estimated value of the third missing point to be the same as that of the second point. Similarly, we can extend this logic to estimate the missing values in multivariate or grouped time series data.

### 3.2 Rolling Mean / Simple Moving Average / Exponential Smoothing / Hull Moving Average
Rolling Mean calculates the running average of a fixed window size (k days). The average is calculated recursively by subtracting the oldest element of the window and adding the newest element. Averaging begins once k number of observations are received. SMA is a variant of the rolling mean where the weights of the observations are equidistant from the center. ES is a generalization of SMA where a weighted exponentially decreasing weight matrix is applied. TES is an extension of ES where seasonal adjustments are incorporated. HMA is an improved version of SMA that adds momentum factors to reduce lag and improve stability. Some popular examples of these techniques include:

1. Rolling Mean: The formula for computing the rolling mean of a time series is smoother(t) = (1/(n+1))*[(smoother(t-1)*k + x_(t))/n], where n is the length of the window, k is the number of days represented by the window, t is the current index, x_(t) is the value at time t, and smoother(t) is the smoothed value at time t. We can implement this using numpy module in Python. Once we calculate the smoothed value for each timestamp, we can continue the recursion until we reach the desired timestamp.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Example dataset
df = pd.DataFrame({'timestamp':pd.date_range('2021-01-01','2021-12-31',freq='D'),
                   'value':np.random.rand(365)})
print(df)

363 2021-12-30   0.395339
364 2021-12-31   0.982769

# Compute the rolling mean for every day using a window size of 7 days
window_size = 7
smoothed_vals = []
for i in range(len(df)):
    start_idx = max(i - window_size + 1, 0)
    end_idx = i + 1
    curr_window = df['value'][start_idx:end_idx]
    window_sum = sum(curr_window)
    window_len = len(curr_window)
    smoothed_val = round(window_sum / window_len, 2)
    smoothed_vals.append(smoothed_val)
    
# Append the computed smooth values to the dataframe
df['smooth'] = smoothed_vals + list(df['value'][window_size:])
print(df[['timestamp','value','smooth']])
      timestamp         value         smooth

```

2. Simple Moving Average: SMA is a variation of the rolling mean where the weights are assigned proportional to the distance of the observation from the center of the window. One way to implement this is to slide a window of size k over the data and multiply the corresponding weights with the observations inside the window. Another way is to create an empty array and update the sum of the values seen so far after each iteration of the loop. Finally, divide the accumulated sum by the total number of values seen in the loop to get the final average. Since SMA relies on a fixed window size, it is more efficient than rolling means for shorter time periods.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Example dataset
df = pd.DataFrame({'timestamp':pd.date_range('2021-01-01','2021-12-31',freq='D'),

# Compute the SMA for every day using a window size of 7 days
window_size = 7
smoothed_vals = []
weight_sum = 0
prev_weights = []
for i in range(len(df)):
    cur_val = df['value'].iat[i]
    start_idx = max(i - window_size + 1, 0)
    end_idx = i + 1
    curr_window = df['value'][start_idx:end_idx]
    diff = abs((window_size - prev_weights[-1])/window_size) if prev_weights else 1
    weights = [(1 - diff)*(abs((j-(window_size//2))+1)/(window_size))**2 + diff*((j-(window_size//2))+1)/(window_size)**2 for j in range(window_size)]
    curr_weighted_sum = sum([(cur_val - val)*weights[j] for j, val in enumerate(curr_window)])
    weight_sum += sum(weights)
    smoothed_val = round(curr_weighted_sum / weight_sum, 2)
    smoothed_vals.append(smoothed_val)
    prev_weights = weights

```

3. Exponential Smoothing (ES): ES is a generalized version of SMA where a weighted decay matrix is applied instead of uniform weights. The weights are determined by a hyperparameter alpha which controls the degree of smoothing. With alpha closer to 1, the weights become increasingly smaller towards the end of the window and fluctuate rapidly. Alpha closer to zero leads to more stable averaging. Trend component captures the changing direction of the data and seasonal component accounts for the cyclical behavior caused by seasonal patterns in the data.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Example dataset
df = pd.DataFrame({'timestamp':pd.date_range('2021-01-01','2021-12-31',freq='D'),
                   'value':np.random.rand(365)})

smoothed_vals = []
level = df['value'].mean()
trend = 0
for i in range(len(df)):
    cur_val = df['value'].iat[i]
    level = alpha * cur_val + (1 - alpha) * (level + trend)

```

4. Triple Exponential Smoothing (TES): TES is an extension of ES that adds a seasonal adjustment term to capture the effects of seasonal patterns. Instead of updating the level component independently, we introduce a seasonal component which represents the effect of seasonal patterns on the level component. Seasonal adjustment coefficients are updated sequentially through the data according to the selected frequency.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas.tseries.offsets import DateOffset

# Example dataset
df = pd.DataFrame({'timestamp':pd.date_range('2021-01-01','2021-12-31',freq='MS'),
                   'value':np.random.rand(12)})

# Define the seasonal periodicity
seasonal_period = 12

# Create an empty arrays to store the adjusted level and seasonal components
adjusted_levels = []
adjusted_seasons = []

# Initialize the initial level and seasonal components
initial_level = df['value'].mean()
init_seasonal = df['value'][0:seasonal_period].mean()
adjusted_levels.append(initial_level)
adjusted_seasons.extend([init_seasonal]*seasonal_period)

# Update the adjusted components sequentially through the data
for i in range(len(df)-seasonal_period):
    cur_ts = df['timestamp'].iat[i]
    cur_val = df['value'].iat[i]
    pred_ts = cur_ts + DateOffset(months=seasonal_period)
    adj_coeff = pow(((pred_ts.year - cur_ts.year)*12 + pred_ts.month - cur_ts.month), 0.5)/pow(seasonal_period, 0.5)
    est_val = cur_val + (adjusted_levels[-1]-cur_val)*adj_coeff + adjusted_seasons[i % seasonal_period]*(1-adj_coeff)
    adjusted_levels.append(est_val)

# Add the computed adjusted values to the dataframe
df['adjusted_level'] = adjusted_levels + [None]*seasonal_period
df['adjusted_seasonal'] = adjusted_seasons
print(df[['timestamp','value','adjusted_level','adjusted_seasonal']])
              timestamp         value adjusted_level  adjusted_seasonal

```

The above code computes the triple exponential smoothing adjustment coefficient for every month in the year separately. We can see that the seasonal adjustment coefficient starts small and gradually increases towards the middle of the year. Eventually, it reaches a peak at the beginning of the year before falling off slowly toward the end. The actual level and seasonal components are obtained by combining the adjusted level and seasonal components with the original data points using the adjustment coefficient.

Hull Moving Average extends the concept of SMA by applying momentum factors to reduce lag and improve stability. Momentum factors are derived based on the correlation between subsequent data points. These factors are multiplied with the respective observations and added to the running average. The resulting score is then divided by the total number of scores obtained to obtain the final value.
