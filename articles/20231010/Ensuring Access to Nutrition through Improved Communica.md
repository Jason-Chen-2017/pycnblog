# 1.背景介绍


Rwanda is one of the poorest countries in Africa and still facing hunger even during periods of economic development. In recent years, there have been numerous hunger strikes against the government agencies that do not address this issue. 

The Central Rhine Region, home to several large agricultural farms along with many mines, is particularly hard hit by these hunger strikes. Between August 2019-November 2020, more than 20 thousand people were left without access to food or shelter for over three months. Despite being on the brink of famine, few Rwandans took up any initiative beyond asking their relatives for help. This has led to continued disruption in normal life as thousands of people around the world are experiencing similar challenges due to lack of nutrition. Therefore, it is essential to devise strategies and policies that promote greater awareness among citizens about the importance of providing safe and affordable nutrition to all.

In December 2020, the Government of Rwanda launched the “Rwanda Day” campaign where teams from across different departments rallied together to mobilize the youth of Rwanda and educate them on the dangers associated with malnutrition. Additionally, various stakeholders such as medical institutions and governments played a crucial role in mobilizing communities to adopt preventive measures such as feeding schemes and increased awareness programs. However, despite these efforts, the problem of hunger still persisted, resulting in high mortality rates.

Therefore, our objective at Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in collaboration with Rwanda's Ministry of Health, Public Health, Population Affairs and others is to develop communication technologies that can effectively address the critical need of providing safe and affordable nutrition to citizens in Rwanda during this difficult time. Specifically, we aim to use data-driven approaches to identify patterns and trends in civic engagement and other relevant factors that contribute towards improving nutrition outcomes in Rwanda. Based on insights gained from analysis, we will design and implement interventions that can enhance access to nutrition for individuals and communities. We believe that improved communication technology could be a cost effective solution that would enable us to address the root cause of poor nutrition outcomes in Rwanda while also creating new opportunities for political action to lead change in policy reform. 

This article presents an in-depth exploration into how better communication techniques can support decision-making processes and improve outcomes for vulnerable populations in Rwanda during times of hunger strike. It highlights key concepts, algorithms, models, code examples, and future research directions for achieving successful implementation of communication solutions. By analyzing past experience, literature review, and existing systems, we provide practical and accessible insights that can guide organizations interested in addressing the hunger crisis in Rwanda.

We begin by exploring the background information of the Rwandan hunger strike. Then, we delve deeper into core ideas, principles, and mechanisms behind nutrition management in Rwanda before explaining its value proposition. Next, we move onto detailed explanation of the proposed system architecture, modules, and workflow used for monitoring and evaluating progress made towards goal setting. Finally, we discuss potential benefits and risks of adopting such a strategy, suggest areas for further research, and offer suggestions for further actions to ensure a smooth transition for those affected by hunger strikes in Rwanda. Overall, we hope that our work inspires a discussion on possible ways forward and provides valuable insights for identifying the most suitable solutions to combat hunger strikes in Rwanda and enabling citizens to obtain healthy nutritious foods.
