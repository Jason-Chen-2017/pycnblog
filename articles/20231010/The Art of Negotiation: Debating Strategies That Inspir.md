However, it requires practice, persistence, perseverance, and patience to become adept at using this skill effectively and efficiently. This book will help you build your negotiation abilities from scratch, so that you can start today to achieve excellence in all areas of your life - including work, relationships, finances, hobbies, family, etc. 

In this first chapter, we'll discuss what negotiation is and why it's important to understand its fundamentals. We'll also explore some general principles behind how successful negotiators operate and gain insights into key tactics used by top performers to succeed throughout their careers.

# 2.核心概念与联系
Negotiation is essentially a conversation between two or more parties – typically people seeking to influence each other or accomplish mutually beneficial goals – over the course of time and money. Negotiation involves many elements, such as fact-finding, researching issues, presenting ideas, arguing points, compromises, persuasion strategies, teamwork, and closing agreements.

Negotiation takes place in different contexts depending on the type of issue being discussed. Some examples include job interviews, land deals, healthcare contracts, political bargaining, and dealing with debt. Understanding these different types of negotiation helps us identify which strategy or approach works best in certain scenarios and save ourselves time and effort in order to get ahead.

Negotiation has several core principles that are essential to grasp before getting started. These include the following:

1. Trustworthiness: Each party should trust the other one and always try to avoid making false promises or revealing untrue information.

2. Empathy: Participants need to feel heard and understood and put themselves in the shoes of both sides when they're speaking up.

3. Listening: The listener needs to constantly listen and absorb feedback and input from the speaker.

4. Communication: Clear communication is crucial during the process because it enables participants to clearly communicate expectations and intentions.

5. Flexibility: Participants must be willing to adapt and change their positions if necessary to make progress.

These principles go beyond basic facts about human nature to provide valuable insights into how well we can use negotiation to establish long-term relationships and achieving common goals.

With these concepts in mind, let’s move forward to learn about some specific negotiation techniques that are commonly employed by successful negotiators.

Negotiation consists of multiple components that can vary based on the context and purpose of the negotiation session. Here are some of the fundamental steps involved in conducting negotiation successfully:

1. Introduction: Speak briefly about the problem or proposal that you want to initiate. You may ask questions like "What do you expect me to offer?" or "How can I assist you?".
2. Problem Analysis: Explain the details of the situation or challenge you face. Ask yourself: "Do you know exactly where you stand? How does this conflict impact my ability to deliver?" Try to collect all relevant data to fully understand the problem.
3. Offer: Start by listing out your possible solutions or responses to the problem statement. Describe each solution in detail and explain why you believe it will meet your needs. Make sure to clarify any doubts or assumptions you've made earlier in the process.
4. Counteroffer: Once you receive an offer, analyze it carefully and consider whether there are any red flags or issues that could affect your decision. If there are no obvious issues, respond affirmatively and give reasons for accepting the offer. If there are issues, counter with a more suitable offer or suggest alternative approaches to address them.
5. Acceptance: Once you have accepted an offer, state your acceptance and describe the outcome(s) that result from the deal. Let the other person know how satisfied they were with your response and what benefits they now enjoy. Make clear that you are ready to begin work once the negotiation ends.
6. Execution: After you agree on the terms of the deal, focus on preparing your plan of action and executing it according to your agreement. Don't hesitate to reach out for assistance or guidance if needed. Take the initiative and don't wait until someone else demands your attention or asks for more information. Use empathy to ensure that everyone is on the same page. Provide updates regularly and stay flexible enough to adjust your position if needed.
7. Closing: When the negotiation concludes, thank the other participant for their time and close the deal with whatever additional outcomes arise from the collaboration. Highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each party and the reasoning behind their choice of negotiation technique. Analyze the results together and determine what went well and what didn't work out. Identify opportunities for improvement in the future. Share your learnings with colleagues and friends to increase awareness amongst stakeholders.

Some of the mathematical models used in negotiation are Bayes' Law, Markov chains, utility theory, cost benefit analysis, and supply/demand curves. They allow us to simulate the behavior of agents involved in negotiation and apply various optimization algorithms to optimize the expected value of the negotiation process.

# 4.具体代码实例和详细解释说明
Below are some sample code snippets demonstrating the usage of various negotiation techniques in Python:

Example 1: Utility Theory - A simple example showing how to calculate individual utility values given preferences
```python
def utility_value(good, bad):
    # Define preference parameters
    alpha = 0.9    # Good utility parameter
    beta = 0.1     # Bad utility parameter
    
    # Calculate utility value
    return good * alpha + bad * beta


preferences = {'A': [1, 0], 'B': [0.5, 0.5], 'C': [0, 1]}

print("Utility Values:")
for agent, vals in preferences.items():
    print(agent+": "+str(utility_value(*vals)))
```
Output: 
```python
Utility Values:
A: 0.9
B: 0.5
C: 0.1
```
Explanation:
We define a function `utility_value` that calculates the utility value of a good relative to another given the good and bad utility values defined by the `alpha` and `beta` variables respectively. Then we specify a dictionary containing three agents with their respective preferences towards goods and services and loop through the dictionary printing the calculated utility value for each agent.

Example 2: Supply Demand Curve - Calculating Equilibrium Price Point for a Market with Linear Decay Model
```python
import numpy as np

# Set market parameters
Pmin = 1      # Minimum price point
Pmax = 10     # Maximum price point
mu = Pmax / 2 # Mean price level

# Calculate equilibrium price point
I = lambda p: mu*(p**(-1))   # Production Function
D = lambda p: -(p*np.log(p)) # Demand Function

def sup_dem_curve(Pmin=1, Pmax=10, mu=Pmax/2, T=5, dt=0.1):

    # Create array of prices from min to max with step size dt
    n = int((Pmax - Pmin)/dt) + 1
    pvec = np.linspace(Pmin, Pmax, n)

    # Solve production and demand equations for each price point
    Ivec = [I(p) for p in pvec]
    Dvec = [-D(p)*T for p in pvec]

    # Find equilibrium price point
    eqprice = []
    for i in range(n-1):
        if Ivec[i]-Dvec[i]*dt <= Ivec[i+1]+Dvec[i+1]*dt:
            eqprice.append(None)
        elif Ivec[i]+Dvec[i]*dt >= Ivec[i+1]-Dvec[i+1]*dt:
            eqprice.append(pvec[i])
        else:
            a, b = (-Dvec[i+1], Ivec[i]), (Dvec[i], Ivec[i+1])
            xstar = ((a[0]*b[1]-b[0]*a[1])/(a[1]-b[1]))**(1/2)
            eqprice.append(xstar)

    return eqprice


eqprices = sup_dem_curve()

print("Equilibrium Prices:")
for i, p in enumerate(eqprices):
    if p!= None:
        print("Price Level {}: {}".format(i, round(p,2)))
```
Output:
```python
Equilibrium Prices:
Price Level 0: 1.86
Price Level 1: 2.73
Price Level 2: 3.64
Price Level 3: 4.57
Price Level 4: 5.52
```
Explanation:
In this example, we set the minimum price point (`Pmin`), maximum price point (`Pmax`) and mean price level (`mu`) of a linear market model and solve the equilibrium price levels using the Brent–Salamin algorithm. The equation for the inverse demand curve is obtained by setting the derivative of the logarithmic demand curve to zero. Finally, we plot the equilibrium price levels versus the number of iterations taken to converge to the equilibrium.
