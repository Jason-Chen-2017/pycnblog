# 1.背景介绍


Serverless computing is a cloud-computing paradigm that enables developers to write code without provisioning or managing servers. The platform takes care of all the underlying infrastructure and provides only runtime environment for running the code. These benefits make serverless computing popular among developers because they don't have to worry about scaling up and down their resources or managing them, which makes it easier for them to build scalable applications.

However, despite its popularity, there has been relatively little research on this new approach to programming and software development. This paper aims to provide an overview of serverless computing's history, presenting key concepts, algorithms, models, and techniques, as well as examples of how these technologies can be applied in real-world scenarios such as image processing, video streaming, and IoT devices. By providing a comprehensive understanding of serverless computing, we hope to inspire developers and encourage further exploration and development in this area.

# 2. Core Concepts & Contacts
## What Is Serverless Computing?
Serverless computing refers to a cloud-computing model where application development focuses on writing business logic instead of managing servers or dedicated hardware. Developers deploy their code directly to the cloud, where the platform handles all the underlying infrastructure automatically, allowing them to focus more on their core competencies.

In general terms, serverless computing involves:

1. No Servers: Instead of buying or renting physical machines, developers create and manage serverless functions using services like AWS Lambda. They define the function inputs (e.g., HTTP requests) and outputs (e.g., API responses), along with any required permissions, triggers, or other configurations. Once defined, the function runs continuously until it completes or is explicitly stopped.

2. FaaS (Function as a Service): Function as a service (FaaS) platforms offer pre-built functions like image resizing or text translation capabilities that can be used out of the box. These are typically deployed by uploading source code to the platform and then configuring the function's settings and trigger conditions.

3. Event Driven Architecture: With event driven architecture, functions are triggered based on events, such as incoming HTTP requests or changes to object storage buckets. In response to these events, the platform executes the corresponding functions, passing the data associated with those events as input parameters. This allows developers to react quickly to changing business requirements and integrate seamlessly into existing systems.

4. Auto Scaling: As demand increases, serverless functions can automatically scale up or down depending on load. This ensures that functions meet the performance requirements of the workload while still being cost effective.

These four pillars of serverless computing form the basic framework behind the technology, but specific implementations may vary depending on the provider and use case. For example, AWS Lambda provides a web service interface for creating and executing functions, while Azure Functions offers support for various languages including JavaScript, Python, C#, Java, and PowerShell.

## How Does It Work?
To understand how serverless computing works, let's consider an example scenario where a developer wants to process uploaded images from users. Here are the steps involved:

1. User uploads an image to an S3 bucket
2. An S3 notification event is sent to an SQS queue, indicating that a new object was created
3. A Lambda function is triggered by the event and begins execution
4. The function retrieves the newly uploaded image from the S3 bucket
5. The image is resized and saved back to the same S3 bucket
6. The resized image is returned to the user via a RESTful API endpoint

Here's what happens under the hood when each step occurs:

- Step 1 - The user uploads an image file through a frontend app to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket.
- Step 2 - When a new object is added to the S3 bucket, an SNS message is generated and sent to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue.
- Step 3 - An AWS Lambda function subscribes to the SQS queue and starts executing whenever a new message arrives.
- Step 4 - The function reads the contents of the S3 bucket and retrieves the newly uploaded image file.
- Step 5 - Using the Pillow library for image manipulation, the function resizes the image and saves it back to the same S3 bucket.
- Step 6 - Finally, the resized image is delivered back to the user over a secure HTTPS connection, using a simple GET request.

This example demonstrates some important aspects of serverless computing:

1. Functions are executed in response to events. Events could include timers, database updates, or external system notifications.
2. Input data is retrieved from remote sources like object stores like Amazon S3.
3. Output data is delivered back to the calling entity over the internet via APIs.
4. Each individual function consists of discrete units of code that run within the context of a larger program or workflow.
5. Different types of functions can be combined together to achieve complex workflows and automate repetitive tasks.

The ability to rapidly develop and deploy new features is also critical for modern digital businesses. Serverless computing opens up exciting new possibilities for developing and operating reliable, scalable applications at low costs.
