# 1.背景介绍


Code comments are an essential part of software development and should be written well for their purpose to be clear and useful. Good code comments make the code easier to understand by developers who may not have a deep understanding of the underlying algorithm or mathematical concepts used in the implementation. As with any written communication, clarity is key, so pay close attention to detail while writing your comments to ensure that they accurately describe what's happening inside your code and how it relates to other parts of the system.

In this article, I'll present some principles and guidelines for writing great code comments and share examples from my own work as a programmer and systems architect. By following these principles, you can write more effective and helpful code comments, which will save time and effort for yourself and others who use your code. Let's get started!

Here are some fundamental concepts and ideas related to code comments:

1. Context matters: The most important thing about comments is that they provide context and information beyond the code itself. If you're explaining why something was done a certain way, include details like reasons behind decisions made, risks involved, edge cases handled, etc. This helps others who read your code later on understand why things were done the way they were. 

2. Explanation versus blathering: Comments should clarify what's going on within the code, but avoid being repetitive or wordy if possible. Use concise explanations wherever possible; only use lengthy passages when necessary. Keep your comments brief and focused on providing value and answering specific questions or concerns. 

3. Easy-to-understand vocabulary: Be sure to choose words that are easy to understand, even to non-technical people. Avoid using technical terms that may not be familiar to those outside your team. 

4. Syntax highlighting: When working in an IDE like Visual Studio or VSCode, syntax highlighting makes it easier to identify different sections of code and comment blocks. Your comments should also follow suit. 

5. Good documentation: Documentation generated from comments becomes crucial for understanding complex systems and improving overall quality. Always try to document your code effectively and keep up-to-date documentation in sync with your code changes. 

6. Collaboration: It's important to collaborate with others on code reviews, bug fixes, and other collaborative activities, so good comments can help everyone improve together.

When implementing algorithms or data structures, one should always write detailed comments alongside the code explaining how each step works and the rationale behind its design choices. Here are some tips for doing this efficiently:

1. Write headers: Every file should start with a header containing general information such as author name, copyright notice, description, and other relevant metadata. Then begin writing individual functions or classes with descriptive headings that explain what they do and list any external dependencies. 

2. Dry vs Wet Comments: In dry comments, you simply repeat what the code already says, making it redundant. For example, "This function computes x squared" would just say the same thing as "x * x". Instead, use wet comments that explain why you chose to implement a particular approach instead of copying the existing code directly. 

An example of a wet comment might look like this: "We calculate the area of the rectangle by multiplying the width times the height." Another example could be: "To reduce the risk of overflow errors during calculations, we check whether the product of the widths and heights is less than the maximum allowed integer size before performing the calculation." 

3. Comment Layout: Organize your comments according to a consistent layout. Consistent layouts make it easier to scan through them quickly and find the ones you need without wasting too much time looking at irrelevant content. Start each comment block with a single short phrase describing what's happening in the code. After that, add additional lines for longer explanations or extra details. Each line of text should be no more than 72 characters long to conform to standard screen sizes. 

4. Symbols and Icons: Add symbols or icons to distinguish between sections of the code and highlight special types of comments. For example, you might use asterisks (*) to denote code snippets or warning messages, and hash marks (#) to indicate sections of code that require careful review. Also consider adding a visual separator like horizontal rules, dividers, or indentation to make comment blocks stand out and separate them visually from surrounding code. 

5. Function Headers: Beginning every function definition with a brief summary of what the function does and any input parameters or output values is a common practice. You should also mention any assumptions made about the input, such as restrictions on the range of values or type of inputs, or limitations on performance or accuracy. 

6. Data Structures: To explain how a data structure is implemented, you should include diagrams or pictures that show how various components interact with each other. These illustrations can help visualize the complexity and interaction of the underlying logic.

7. Math Formulas: When dealing with math formulas, you should clearly define the variables and equations used in the formula, including units, symbols, and capitalization. Mention any assumptions made about the inputs or constraints on the behavior of the formula, such as limits on the number of digits after the decimal point or precision requirements. 

Overall, by following these principles, you can write better and more informative code comments that benefit both you and your colleagues who may be reading and maintaining your code years down the road.
