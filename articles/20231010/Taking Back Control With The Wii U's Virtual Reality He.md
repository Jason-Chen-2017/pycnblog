# 1.背景介绍


The Wii U virtual reality headset (VRH) has become an immensely popular console in recent years due to its sleek appearance and ability to provide a high-quality experience. However, with so many VR devices on the market, there is still little guidance available for designers as to how to effectively use these devices and create their own interaction models. This article provides information about what makes up the VRH's input controller and gives practical advice on how to go about creating your own customizable model. 

In this article, we will be discussing:

1. How the input controller works and how it can be customized using programming languages such as Python or Lua? 

2. What are some of the best practices that should be followed while developing a custom interaction model for the VRH? 

3. We'll also explore the limitations of the current default input model provided by Nintendo, and discuss how alternative methods for controlling the device may better suit different types of gameplay scenarios. 

Before getting into any of the above topics, let us first define what we mean by "interaction model" here. An interaction model refers to all aspects of gaming related to movement, controls, actions, and interactions between the user and the environment around them. In other words, it encompasses everything from overall player character control and movement to weapon selection and trigger combinations. By designing and implementing an effective interaction model, developers can create games that are more immersive, challenging, and enjoyable than those created without one. 

In short, the main goal of designing a custom interactive system for the VRH is to make players feel like they are actually playing inside the virtual world rather than just being staring at a flat screen, which is commonplace in most traditional PC gaming environments. As the VR industry continues to mature, it is essential for gaming companies to continue investing in new hardware platforms and offerings to appeal to the next generation of enthusiasts, regardless of their technical skills or knowledge base. To enable this, engineers must understand not only how to leverage the VRH's built-in capabilities but also design custom interaction models specifically tailored to their target audience and intended game genre. If you want to develop your own unique VR HMD and you have no idea where to start, then this article is for you! You can learn how to create your own custom interaction model for the Wii U VR headset step-by-step with practical examples. 

Now let's get started!

## Input Controller Overview
The Wii U's VR headset features a wide range of controllers, including the classic GamePad, Classic Controller, Balance Board, Nunchuk, and Guitar Hero controllers. Each type offers varying degrees of customization options, ranging from simple button presses to fully programmable hand gestures. Here is an overview of each type of controller:

1. **GamePad:** Provides three buttons (A, B, X), two analog sticks, and one directional pad. It is considered the simplest type of controller and does not require additional attachments, making it ideal for quick commands and browsing through menus. 

2. **Classic Controller:** Similar to the GamePad, except with four additional buttons (Y, Z, L, R). These buttons allow the user to perform extra tasks, such as interacting with objects in the environment, navigating menus, or accessing settings. They come in black and white and are easier to read compared to red and green ones. 

3. **Balance Board:** A seven-degree-of-freedom balance board allows the user to move both hands independently and rotate them horizontally to adjust their position. The balance board itself needs to be worn under the head for optimal performance. There are different versions of the balance board available depending on the size and weight requirements of users' bodies. 

4. **Nunchuck:** Also known as the "classic controller," this controller comes equipped with five digital inputs (buttons + joystick) that allow for advanced control over the motion of the Wii U's accelerometer sensor. The Nunchuck can be used standalone or paired with either the Classic Controller or the Guitar Hero controller. 

5. **Guitar Hero Controller**: The largest and most versatile controller among the Wii U's VR controllers. It consists of six analog inputs that provide various functions, including triggering moves with the guitar neck, spinning the palm to execute complex movements, and shaking the controller to simulate fingers. Other inputs include a D-pad and touch sensitive areas for manipulating objects in the environment. It requires an additional attachment called a "guitar case" to protect the user's hands and prevent accidental triggers. Additionally, users need to take special care when holding down the trigger during practice sessions or matches to avoid injury.
