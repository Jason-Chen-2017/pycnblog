# 1.背景介绍


Callbacks and promises are the two main ways to manage asynchronous operations in JavaScript code. They provide a simple yet powerful way to handle asynchronicity, but they can sometimes be harder to use than other techniques such as Observables (RxJS) or async/await syntax. 

However, reactive programming provides an alternative paradigm that is often more suitable for complex applications with high concurrency and latency requirements. The basic idea behind reactive programming is to treat computations as streams of values over time instead of as isolated events, which makes it easier to reason about and debug. This article will explore why callbacks and promises may still be useful despite their drawbacks, and then demonstrate how reactive programming can simplify your code by handling common scenarios such as error handling and cancellation.

Reactive programming can also offer performance benefits compared to using callback-based or promise-based approaches due to its ability to parallelize work across multiple threads or processes without blocking the event loop. However, this benefit comes at a cost - reactive libraries like RxJS require additional setup and learning curve, while promise-based solutions can be simpler to start with.

In summary, callbacks and promises are both valid methods for managing asynchronous code in JavaScript, but only some developers may find them convenient and easy to use. Reactive programming offers an alternative approach that can make your code clearer, safer, and more flexible.

# 2.Core Concepts and Relationship
## Callbacks
A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument and called from within that function when certain conditions have been met. A common example is the `setTimeout()` method, which takes a callback function as an argument and executes it after a specified number of milliseconds:

```javascript
function greet(name, delay) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(`Hello ${name}!`), delay);
}
greet("John", 2000); // Output: Hello John!
```

The callback function here logs a message to the console after waiting for the specified delay period. It's important to note that a callback function should not modify any shared state or data structures since those changes could affect unrelated parts of the program. Additionally, errors thrown inside a callback function will cause the entire application to crash. 

Here's an example where we pass a callback function to another function as an argument and call it later on:

```javascript
function addNumbers(a, b, callback) {
  const result = a + b;
  if (callback && typeof callback === 'function') {
    callback(result);
  } else {
    console.log('Callback must be a function');
  }
}

addNumbers(2, 3, value => console.log(`Result: ${value}`)); 
// Output: Result: 5

addNumbers(2, 3); // No output because no callback was provided
```

This demonstrates how passing a callback function as an argument allows you to execute code after a task has completed. The optional second parameter of the `addNumbers` function shows that we can also log the result directly to the console if a callback wasn't provided. 

Overall, callbacks are good for executing small bits of logic asynchronously and avoiding issues related to modifying shared state. However, they're limited in terms of what types of tasks they can perform and don't support composition well.

## Promises
Promises are objects returned by asynchronous functions that represent an operation that hasn't finished yet but will complete in the future. Promises expose a `.then()` method that accepts two arguments - a fulfillment handler and a rejection handler. Once a promise is resolved, either successfully or with an error, the appropriate handler is executed. Here's an example of creating and resolving a promise:

```javascript
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve('Success!');
});

myPromise
 .then(value => console.log(value))
 .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

In this case, the promise resolves immediately with a value of "Success!", so the first `console.log()` statement gets executed. If there were an error instead, the `.catch()` block would catch it and print it to the console. Unlike callbacks, promises allow chaining multiple handlers together and can better express complex asynchronous workflows.

However, promises aren't always ideal for working with large amounts of data or streaming data. For instance, retrieving a list of users from a database might involve several round trips to the server and loading all the results before processing anything. Using callbacks or reactive programming allows us to process each item individually as it arrives from the database, making our code more efficient and responsive. 

Finally, even though promises give us a lot of flexibility in dealing with asynchronous operations, they come with some overhead and complexity that can slow down our programs. Developers should consider carefully whether they need the added functionality or performance benefits provided by promises before choosing between these options. 

## Observables and Reactive Programming Paradigms
Observables are objects used in reactive programming to represent a stream of values over time. An observable is typically created by wrapping existing APIs or operations that produce data over time, and providing subscribers who receive the updates as soon as they become available. There are many different kinds of observables, including arrays, event streams, HTTP requests, etc.

One advantage of observables is that they offer a declarative style of programming that separates the creation of the source of data (e.g., fetching user data from a REST API) from the consumers of that data (e.g., displaying the information to the user). Another key feature is that they separate the concern of managing timing and buffering vs. actually producing the data. Finally, they can improve scalability by allowing parallelism and distributing the workload among multiple threads or processes.

Reactive programming brings several concepts and principles together into one framework. We'll examine each concept and describe how they interact in reactive programming. 

### Observer Pattern
In observer pattern, an object known as the subject calls the notify() method on one or more registered observers whenever there is an update to the subject's state. Observers register themselves with the subject through the subscribe() method and unsubscribe through the unsubscribe() method. In reactive programming, the subject usually represents some kind of input stream, while the observers represent the various transformations and effects that act on that input stream. The notification mechanism allows the subject to inform the observers of changes in the input stream, and the observers react accordingly.

### Iterator Pattern
The iterator pattern defines a standard interface for traversing collections of items sequentially. In reactive programming, iterators are used to traverse the sequence of emitted elements from an observable or iterable collection. Each element is produced as needed based on demand, and the iteration continues until the end of the collection is reached. By default, most modern JavaScript environments implement the iterator protocol, allowing us to easily iterate over arrays, maps, sets, strings, or generators.

### Subscribe Operator
The subscribe operator is responsible for subscribing an observer to an observable. It returns a subscription object that contains methods to unsubscribe from the observable and to check the status of the subscription. The subscribe operator is commonly used in combination with operators like map(), filter(), reduce(), etc., which transform or manipulate the incoming values. In reactive programming, this means that we can chain these operators together to create complex data pipelines that react to inputs in real-time.

### Scheduler
The scheduler determines the order in which subscriptions occur and manages the execution of the chained operators. Some schedulers may run the iterations synchronously, while others may offload the iterations to a worker thread or microtask queue for improved performance. The scheduler controls when the notifications are delivered, ensuring that the resulting stream produces the correct output at the right moment.

# 3.Algorithm Principles and Operation Steps 
The core algorithmic principles behind reactive programming include backpressure, non-blocking I/O, and flow control. Backpressure refers to the restriction of data production in response to consumption rate, leading to cases where the producer generates faster than the consumer can consume it, causing memory issues or crashes. Non-blocking I/O involves enabling I/O operations to return immediately, without blocking the calling thread, thus reducing the impact of I/O operations on overall system performance. Flow control refers to limiting the rate at which items are processed or emitted, preventing excessive resource usage or overwhelming downstream systems.

To effectively apply reactive programming principles to JavaScript code, we need to understand three fundamental components:
1. The Observable - Represents the input stream of data generated by an external source.
2. Operators - Transformations applied to the input stream to generate the output stream. 
3. Subscribers - Consume the transformed output stream and do something with the data. 

Let's take a closer look at how we can apply these principles to solve common problems in JavaScript.

 ## Handling Errors With Observables
 One of the biggest challenges in handling errors in JavaScript is that exceptions can be raised anywhere in our code, including third-party libraries, network connections, and file reads. While some libraries like RxJS include error handling mechanisms built in, some others don't. To ensure robustness, we need to design our own error handling strategy that accounts for potential errors in every part of our code. 

 ### Example Problem - Fetching User Data From an API
 Suppose we want to display a list of user names fetched from a remote API endpoint. We might write code similar to this:

  ```javascript
  fetch('/users')
   .then(response => response.json())
   .then(users => {
      // Display the list of user names...
    })
   .catch(error => {
      console.error('Error:', error);
    });
  ```
  
  The above code uses the Fetch API to retrieve the list of users, converts the JSON response to a JS object, and displays the user names to the screen. If there's an error during the request or parsing step, the error is caught and logged to the console. However, suppose the API endpoint suddenly goes down or responds with malformed data? How can we recover gracefully from these errors and continue rendering the rest of the app?  
  
 ### Solution - Adding Error Handling With Observables  
 To account for errors during the fetching process, we can wrap the fetch operation inside an Observable, which will automatically retry the request upon failure and emit the successful result once it becomes available. We can use RxJS' `retryWhen` operator to configure the maximum number of retries and backoff interval, and attach an error handler to the resulting Observable using the `tap` operator. Here's how we can rewrite the previous code using RxJS:

   ```javascript
   import { ajax } from 'rxjs/ajax';
   import { tap, retryWhen } from 'rxjs/operators';

   const url = '/users';
   const getUsers$ = () =>
     ajax.getJSON(url).pipe(
       retryWhen(errors =>
         errors
          .pipe(
             concatMap((error, index) =>
               timer(index * 1000).pipe(
                 ignoreElements(),
                 tap(() => console.warn(`Retry #${index}:`, error))
               )
             ),
             takeUntil(observableOf(false)),
             repeat()
           )
       ),
       catchError(error => throwError(`Failed to load users: ${error}`))
     );

   getUsers$().subscribe({
     next: users => {
       // Render the list of user names...
     },
     error: error => console.error(error),
     complete: () => console.info('Done!')
   });
   ```

   In this version of the code, we've replaced the Fetch API with the `ajax.getJSON()` method from RxJS, which returns an Observable rather than a Promise. We've also included the `retryWhen` operator to handle failures gracefully by retrying the request up to a configurable limit. Note that we've wrapped the Retry logic inside a higher-order Observable (`concatMap`) and combined it with the `takeUntil` and `repeat` operators to achieve the desired effect of repeating the failed request indefinitely until stopped.
