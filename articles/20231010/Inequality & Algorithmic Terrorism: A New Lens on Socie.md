# 1.背景介绍


Inequality is a key element to understanding the current state of social inequality in society. Despite this, there has been very little attention paid to algorithmic terrorism as it impacts all walks of life from personal or family life interactions to workplace collaboration. To understand how misinformation spread amongst people and how this can affect human lives and wellbeing, we need to look beyond just hype about AI systems fighting against discrimination and bias. 

Algorithmic terrorism involves making predictions based on historical patterns and data that are used for malicious purposes such as cyberattacks, fraudulent transactions, defamation and intimidation. It can be categorized into two main types namely Adversarial Attack and Propaganda Spread. Adversarial attacks use machine learning models that predict future outcomes with high accuracy but are designed to deceive humans. These models often make mistakes which propagate as far back as generations leading to systematic harm. On the other hand, propaganda spread uses data-driven techniques like social media platforms where users share false information for political, economic or ideological reasons. The purpose behind these practices is to promote their agendas by spreading fake news, divisive comments and inflammatory reactions. This has led to widespread prejudice, violence, distrust and refusal towards humans in many regions around the world.

This paper will focus on analyzing and exploring various aspects related to algorithmic terrorism that include its impact on different demographics, development of new technologies and the role of algorithms in promoting political polarization and increasement of inequality within society.

## 2.1 Gini Coefficient
The Gini coefficient (also known as Gini index) is a measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent the income or wealth distribution of a nation or region. It was developed by economist Francis Galton in his 1912 book "The Measurement of Economic Dispersion." 

It is defined mathematically as follows: 

1 - Σ(i=1)^n [(ni/Σ^n_j kij)]^2

where ni is the number of items classified into category i, j =/= i, and kij represents the total amount of item j in category i. 

A value of zero indicates perfect equality between the categories while a value of one means complete inequality. 

## 2.2 Relative Deprivation Index (RDI)
Relative deprivation index (RDI) is an approach to measuring poverty and inequality across countries. Developed by <NAME> and colleagues in the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), RDI measures the extent to which individual's standard of living relative to those of other poor groups varies. It is calculated by subtracting the average income level of the richest 1% group from the income levels of all individuals in a given country. 

More specifically, RDI compares the standard of living of each household to the national median of income at the point when the survey was conducted. An RDI score of less than 100 corresponds to low levels of poverty whereas scores above 100 indicate significant levels of poverty. 

## 2.3 Exposure to Alcohol
Alcohol consumption is one of the major factors contributing to socioeconomic status in developing countries. According to World Health Organization (WHO), alcohol has the following adverse effects on health: 

1. Increased risk of heart disease

2. Higher risk of stroke

3. Significant increased risk of breast cancer

4. Reduced lifespan and quality of life

Exposure to alcohol may also be correlated with social cohesion, mobility patterns, conflict, violence and mental health issues. Therefore, researchers have proposed multiple methods to study alcohol exposure from different perspectives including behavioral changes, genetic epidemiology, environmental pollution, etc.

## 3.1 KDD Cup 1999 Dataset
KDD Cup 1999 dataset contains data collected from log files of 12 real-world intrusion detection systems. The datasets contain raw network traffic logs containing both benign and attack packets along with labeled events indicating whether the packet was normal or anomalous. There are three types of labels in the dataset: normal (class label 0), anomaly (class label 1), and error (unknown). 

### Data Preprocessing Techniques
Data preprocessing techniques involve cleaning and formatting data before feeding it to analysis algorithms. These techniques typically consist of removing noise and redundant features, handling missing values, scaling numerical attributes and encoding categorical variables. After preprocessing, the dataset should be split into training set, validation set and test set for model evaluation.

### Feature Selection Methods
Feature selection refers to identifying relevant features that contribute most to the classification task. Several feature selection methods exist including correlation analysis, chi-square test, recursive feature elimination, forward stepwise selection, backward Elimination, and support vector machines. 

### Model Selection Methods
Model selection involves selecting appropriate modeling technique or algorithm based on the nature of the problem and available data. Various supervised learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, neural networks, support vector machines, and Naive Bayes classifier have been applied to detect anomalies in network traffic logs.

#### Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a popular binary classification algorithm that is widely used for text classification and spam filtering applications. Logistic regression calculates the probability of occurrence of event using linear combination of input parameters. Mathematically, it represents the odds ratio as: 


oddsRatio = P(y=1|X) / P(y=0|X)



where y is the output variable taking binary values (0 or 1) and X is the set of input variables. By fitting the coefficients of the logistic function to the observed data points, the logistic regression model estimates the probabilities of occurrence of the event accurately. 

#### Decision Trees
Decision trees are non-parametric classification method that divide the input space into rectangles based on the attribute values. They start with finding the best attribute to split the nodes recursively until all leaves are pure or no further splitting is possible. 

Mathematically, decision tree classification makes use of conditional inference theory to calculate the likelihood of each class label given the evidence provided by the input vectors. It forms a series of questions asked to determine the next node to branch off. The process stops when the end of the line is reached or the remaining records belong to the same class.

#### Random Forests
Random forests are ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees trained on randomly selected subsets of the training set. Each tree in the forest considers a slightly different subset of the data and produces a probabilistic estimate of the outcome. The final prediction is made based on the majority vote of the predictions from all the trees in the forest. The advantage of random forests is that they provide better accuracy than single decision trees and handle large datasets more efficiently.

#### Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) are another type of ensemble learning method that combines multiple weak learners to produce accurate results. GBMs train each learner iteratively, starting from an empty model and adding one predictor per iteration. GBM adjusts the weights of incorrectly predicted instances to minimize the loss function. At each iteration, a new learner is added that tries to correct the errors made by the previous ones. 

#### Neural Networks
Neural Networks (NNs) are deep learning method that are particularly useful for complex problems requiring nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs. NN architectures consists of layers of interconnected nodes that apply non-linear transformations to the input data. Different activation functions and regularization techniques are used to reduce overfitting and improve generalization performance of the model. 

#### Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are powerful machine learning technique capable of performing linear or nonlinear classification tasks. SVMs create a hyperplane in multidimensional space that separates the data into classes. The goal of SVM is to find the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the two classes without allowing any points to violate the margin. The kernel trick is employed to enable SVMs to solve problems in higher dimensional spaces. 

### Performance Metrics
Performance metrics quantify the accuracy of the model and help us evaluate its efficacy. Common performance metrics used in anomaly detection include F1 Score, Precision, Recall, Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC), and confusion matrix. F1 score combines precision and recall into a single metric that balances them equally and provides a balanced measure of model’s ability to correctly identify both true positives and negatives.
