# 1.背景介绍

:Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are powerful machine learning models for image recognition tasks such as object detection, classification, and segmentation. In this article we will focus on the fundamental building blocks of CNNs, which form the core of many deep neural network architectures. Specifically, we will explain what convolutional layers do, how they combine multiple feature maps to learn spatial relationships between pixels in an image, and how activations from these layers can be fed into downstream layers to improve performance. We will also cover pooling layers, which reduce the dimensionality of each feature map while preserving important information about the input image. Finally, we will discuss fully connected layers, which perform classification or regression tasks by combining the outputs from earlier layers and applying linear transformations.

# 2.核心概念与联系:Before diving into the specific details of CNN architecture, it is worth noting some key concepts that underlie the structure of traditional neural networks and CNNs. 

### Neuron: A neuron is the basic processing unit of a neural network. It receives inputs, performs an operation on those inputs using its weights, and produces an output based on a transfer function. Neurons typically have multiple inputs, but here we will assume there is only one input per neuron, representing the pixel intensity at a particular position in an image. Each neuron belongs to a layer in the network, where connections are established between neurons across adjacent layers. By passing data through this network of interconnected neurons, the network learns to recognize patterns and make predictions based on the input data.

### Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP): MLP is a type of feedforward artificial neural network designed to classify data points. In an MLP, the input data is fed through several fully connected layers, where each neuron in a given layer connects to all neurons in the previous layer. There are no cycles or feedback loops in an MLP; thus, it cannot handle recursive or non-linear problems like decision trees and images.

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): CNN is a class of deep neural networks developed specifically for computer vision tasks. It applies filters to the input image to extract and learn spatial patterns, and then feeds these learned features into further layers of the network for classification and prediction tasks. The primary difference between a CNN and a standard neural network is that the former applies filters to the input image at different positions and scales, allowing it to capture both local and global contextual information in the image. This results in better accuracy compared to MLPs trained on raw pixel values. 

CNNs consist of four key components:
- Convolutional Layers: These layers apply filters to the input image at different positions and scales to extract spatial features. The resulting feature maps represent the various aspects of the input image captured by the filter, which are passed on to subsequent layers in the network. For example, a single convolutional layer might extract horizontal and vertical edges in an image, whereas another layer might identify textures or patterns in the image.
- Activation Functions: These layers take the feature maps generated by the previous layer and produce outputs by applying an elementwise activation function. Common choices for activation functions include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), sigmoid, softmax, tanh, and elu.
- Pooling Layers: These layers downsample the input image by performing max pooling or average pooling operations over small regions of the feature maps. They can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps and preserve relevant features, making them easier to process later in the network.
- Fully Connected Layers: These layers take the final set of pooled feature maps and flatten them into a long vector before being passed on to a classifier or regressor. These layers provide the ability to capture higher level spatial structures and dependencies in the input image, enabling CNNs to generalize better than standard neural networks.
