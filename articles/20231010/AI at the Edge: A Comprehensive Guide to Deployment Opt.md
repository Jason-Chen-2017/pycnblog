# 1.背景介绍


AI at the Edge refers to artificial intelligence (AI) systems that operate on edge devices such as mobile phones, wearable technological devices or robots. The term "edge" refers to a place where data processing is performed remotely from other parts of the network. In recent years, with advances in technology, many companies are building more advanced edge computing solutions that can help them meet new business needs and address issues that were not possible beforehand using traditional IT architectures. However, these technologies also bring challenges in terms of hardware, software, security, privacy, and reliability, which need to be addressed accordingly for practical deployment. 

This article aims to provide an overview of different deployment options available for AI at the Edge along with their strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, it will cover various open-source and proprietary technologies used for developing AI applications running at the edge, including cloud platforms, containerization tools, programming languages, edge servers, networking infrastructure, and IoT platforms. We will also discuss some key considerations while selecting a particular solution based on factors such as price, speed, performance, scalability, cost-effectiveness, and end user experience. Finally, we will present some industry-specific use cases demonstrating how these technologies have impacted industries like transportation, manufacturing, healthcare, energy, and e-commerce.

To ensure this article is useful and comprehensive, we will seek to draw on extensive expertise and resources across several disciplines and sectors to guide our discussion and conclusions. Our goal is to create an engaging resource that helps readers understand the latest advancements in AI at the Edge and identify suitable deployment options for their specific requirements.

In summary, the main goals of this article are to provide a holistic understanding of AI at the Edge by reviewing the major components involved in its development, discussing design choices, and identifying appropriate technologies for practical application. It should serve as a valuable reference for those looking to deploy advanced AI algorithms at the edge. We hope you find it informative and helpful!

# 2. Core Concepts and Relationships
Edge Computing uses distributed computing principles to process large amounts of data near real time. It consists of two layers - the first layer consists of data collection/transmission mechanisms such as sensors, cameras, microphones etc., whereas the second layer is a set of computational resources located either locally or remotely that performs high-performance computations on this data. These computers may communicate directly with each other through wireless networks or via gateways or routers. There are three types of edge computing architectures - Cloud-based, Fog-based, and Edge-based.

 * Cloud-based architecture deploys centralized servers that act as computing centers that can perform complex calculations, machine learning, and storage functions. This architecture requires internet connectivity and supports large scale deployments but lacks local computation power.

 * Fog-based architecture involves deploying lightweight servers at strategic locations within the network called fog nodes. These nodes store data locally and exchange information with adjacent nodes to share load among multiple users. To enable this architecture, specialized hardware and software solutions are required.

 * Edge-based architecture focuses on using smartphones, tablets, laptops, and robots as computing devices. This approach relies on low-power consumption, small size, and ease of installation. These devices are usually placed close to the source of the data they collect. Hence, this architecture has unique benefits compared to cloud-based and fog-based architectures due to its low latency, reduced bandwidth requirements, and ability to support fast response times.
 
Regardless of the type of edge computing architecture chosen, there are several core concepts and relationships between them that must be understood in order to build successful edge computing solutions. 

 * Scalability: The concept of scalability refers to the ability of an edge system to handle increasing workload without significant changes in hardware configuration. This means that cloud-based and fog-based solutions offer highly scalable capabilities but require additional hardware resources to host more nodes. On the other hand, edge-based solutions are designed to work with minimal hardware resources making them ideal for edge analytics.

 * Privacy: Security and privacy concerns are critical for any enterprise implementation of edge computing solutions. With increased popularity of smart home devices, access to sensitive information becomes much easier than ever. Therefore, compliance with data protection laws and regulations become crucial factors when implementing edge computing solutions.

 * Latency: As mentioned earlier, edge-based architectures rely on short communication distances to achieve low latency. However, unlike cloud-based and fog-based architectures, which often have lower latency constraints due to interconnected nature of the network, edge-based solutions still face the challenge of achieving sub-millisecond latencies even under extreme conditions.

 * Cost-Effectiveness: One of the primary reasons for the rapid growth in the usage of edge computing lies in its cost-effectiveness aspect. Most popular edge computing services today come with well-defined pricing plans and free tiers that allow customers to test out their service and evaluate its feasibility before committing to a paid subscription plan.

Based on the above points, the following sections will dive deeper into the technical details of various deployment options available for AI at the edge and highlight key considerations for choosing the right option based on factors such as price, speed, performance, scalability, cost-effectiveness, and end user experience.
