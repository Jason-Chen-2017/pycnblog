# 1.背景介绍




Visual reference resolution is one of the critical challenges in computer vision tasks such as video understanding and retrieval, where a model must learn to match input videos with their corresponding references or ground-truth images. In this task, both input videos and references usually consist of multiple objects, making it challenging for existing deep learning approaches that use single attention mechanisms. 

Inspired by recent advances in visual tracking, we propose an efficient dual attention network (DAN) that incorporates two parallel attention mechanisms into each object detection module of DAN, which enables better modeling of spatial relationships between objects. Moreover, DAN exploits complementary cues from both visual features and temporal information to improve the accuracy of visual reference resolution in videos. 


Dual attention mechanism has been shown to be effective in addressing challenges related to occlusion, motion blur, and partial/out-of-view objects in video. However, applying separate attention modules on different modalities brings some limitations: it fails to consider cross-modal interactions that are important in videos due to their intrinsic properties of multi-object appearance and motion changes. To overcome these issues, we introduce two novel mechanisms to jointly capture cross-modal dependencies: cross-channel feature fusion and visual-temporal co-attention. We also design several sub-networks to adaptively weight the contributions of different components of the inputs to achieve more accurate predictions.


Experiments show that our DNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various datasets for visual reference resolution in videos while achieving competitive results under adverse conditions. The source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper. This article summarizes our work towards building a generalizable and robust framework for visual reference resolution in videos using a dual attention architecture. 



# 2.Core Concepts and Connections



Our proposed Dual Attention Network consists of four main components - Object Detection Module(ODM), Video Feature Extractor(VFE), Cross Channel Fusion Unit(CCF), and Visual Temporal Co-Attention Unit(VTCA). The ODM extracts visual features at various scales from individual frames in the input videos and generates object bounding boxes using Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs). These object proposals then feed through VFE, which learns a shared representation of the input image sequence. The output of VFE feeds into CCF, which fuses multimodal visual features across channels obtained from different layers of CNNs. The outputs from CCF serve as inputs to VTCA, which captures global dependencies between multimodal representations and aligned temporal sequences generated from the same video clip. Both ODM and VFE form the backbone of our dual attention network which can be trained end-to-end without any supervision. We train our model on three benchmarks datasets - MOTSChallenge, Charades, and DIOR, and obtain significant improvements compared to baselines. 


The overall framework is illustrated in Fig. 1 below:

To implement the above pipeline, we need to define several key operations and modules:

1. **Object Detection Module**

   Consists of several convolutional neural networks used to detect and localize objects in input videos. It produces object proposal coordinates and scores for every frame in the video. Some popular architectures include R-CNN, Fast RCNN, and Mask-RCNN.
   

2. **Video Feature Extractor**

   Takes the output from the Object Detection Module and returns a fixed length vector encoding the entire video sequence. A variety of models have been developed to encode videos into vectors, including dense optical flow based encoders like ConvLSTM and SlowFast, or transformer-based encoders like CLIP and ProxylessNAS. Here, we use VGGish, which is a simple yet powerful pre-trained audio-visual embedding model designed specifically for audio classification tasks. Its encoder takes an RGB or optical flow image of size $224 \times 224$ and returns a vector of size $128$.
   

3. **Cross-Channel Fusion Units**

   Each channel of the output of VGGish corresponds to a particular frequency band. As a result, if there are multiple objects present in the scene, they may appear at different frequencies in the output. Therefore, we apply attention mechanisms to align these features within each channel. Common attention mechanisms include softmax, dot product, and multi-head attention. We use cross-channel feature fusion unit that combines different frequency bands of the input features into a unified feature space. For example, we take the maximum value of all frequency bands as the final fused feature. 
   

4. **Visual-Temporal Co-Attention Unit**

   To capture global dependencies between multimodal representations and aligned temporal sequences, we exploit the fact that in videos, similar objects tend to appear in consecutive frames and move together. We propose to generate query features that represent the current frame's contextual information and key features that represent the surrounding frames' temporal information. Based on these features, we compute attentions weights, which indicate how much each pair of objects should be weighted during fusion. Finally, we fuse these attentions along with visual features to produce the final output of the network.
