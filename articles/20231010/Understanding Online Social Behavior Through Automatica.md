# 1.背景介绍


Online social networks (OSNs) are widely used in our daily lives to communicate and interact with people around the world. They provide a platform where users can create profiles, post content such as photos, videos, links, text messages, etc., share their interests, experiences and opinions, and receive feedback from other users. These interactions and social behavior are usually analysed using various methods such as statistical analysis, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and network analysis. However, extracting meaningful insights from this data is often challenging due to the large volume of generated textual data that OSNs produce. To address these challenges, we propose an approach based on automatic text generation models which enables us to generate realistic yet informative synthetic datasets for understanding online social behavior. 

Textual data generated by automated text generation models have several advantages over natural language input: they are easy to generate, more comprehensive than traditional keyword-based search queries, and well-suited for representing complex and diverse aspects of human social interaction. For example, recent advancements in machine learning have enabled new ways of generating textual data including deep neural networks (DNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), transformers, and reinforcement learning algorithms. Therefore, it is important to explore whether textual data generated by DNNs or GANs has potential to support accurate and effective social analysis tasks related to user behavior and engagement with OSSN platforms.  

In this paper, we present a novel approach for automatically generating high-quality synthetic textual datasets through combining existing techniques for text generation with state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for text representation. Specifically, we leverage pre-trained transformer-based language models like BERT, GPT-2, T5, and RoBERTa and fine-tune them using multitask learning approaches to enable text generation without any supervision or labeled data. We also develop a multi-task loss function that considers multiple objective functions such as perplexity, semantic similarity, and readability. Finally, we demonstrate how our method can be applied to analyze the behavior and characteristics of users on OSSN platforms, such as identifying topics of discussion, predicting emotional reactions towards posts, monitoring public opinion polls, detecting spam and abusive behaviors, among others. Our proposed approach significantly improves the accuracy, quality, and efficiency of social analysis tasks compared to alternative approaches that use hand-crafted features or rule-based systems. 

Overall, our work provides a valuable contribution towards enabling better understanding of online social behavior through automatically generated textual data. It opens up a new perspective for researchers interested in leveraging the power of AI to extract actionable insights from massive amounts of unstructured data generated by OSSN platforms. The results obtained through our approach may inspire industry players to adopt similar technologies to improve their offerings to the end-users. Moreover, there exists significant room for improvement in terms of scalability, interpretability, and robustness of our approach. Nevertheless, the potential of our approach makes it promising for further investigation.

## A.Online Social Networks (OSNs)
Online social networks (OSNs) are communication services that allow individuals to establish relationships with each other via virtual spaces, called "social graphs". Users can create profiles, upload content, express themselves through text messages, video calls, chat rooms, blogs, etc. These activities result in rich social media data that can be analyzed and studied to gain insight into user behavior and preferences. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) defines two types of OSNs: social networking sites (SNSs) and community collaboration tools. SNSs are websites that focus on providing personalized information sharing between members while community collaboration tools emphasize group-based interactions. Many popular OSNs include Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and LinkedIn.

## B.Automated Text Generation Models
There are many automated text generation models available today, some of them trained on vast corpora of text data, while others rely solely on hand-crafted rules or templates. Some of the most commonly used automated text generation models include Markov chains, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Transformer-based models such as BERT, GPT-2, and T5. These models learn to map a sequence of words to another sequence of words that sound like they might occur naturally in written English. In order to achieve good performance on a wide range of text generation tasks, these models require extensive training on a variety of text sources such as news articles, web pages, wikipedia pages, and medical texts.

To increase the usefulness of textual data generated by these models, we need to understand their limitations and adapt them to meet specific needs. One limitation of standard text generation models is their dependence on highly structured inputs such as predefined grammars or syntax trees. This means that they cannot handle a wide range of language structures, such as free-form writing styles, idiomatic expressions, exaggerations, and metaphors. Furthermore, these models tend to produce long sequences of mostly uninterpretable output that do not convey much meaning on their own.

To overcome these shortcomings, we propose to combine different approaches for text generation and deep learning techniques for text representation to generate higher-quality synthetic textual datasets. Specifically, we leverage pre-trained transformer-based language models like BERT, GPT-2, T5, and RoBERTa and fine-tune them using multitask learning approaches to enable text generation without any supervision or labeled data. We also develop a multi-task loss function that considers multiple objective functions such as perplexity, semantic similarity, and readability. These improvements make our model more generalizable and reliable at predicting realistic but informative text. Additionally, we demonstrate how our method can be applied to analyze the behavior and characteristics of users on OSSN platforms, such as identifying topics of discussion, predicting emotional reactions towards posts, monitoring public opinion polls, detecting spam and abusive behaviors, among others.
