# 1.背景介绍


近年来，随着量子计算机、网络、存储等新一代信息技术的出现，人们越来越关注quantum information science (QIS)，这是利用量子力学产生的奇特性对普通信息进行编码、处理、传输、应用的一门学术研究领域。以下是对QIS的定义：

Quantum Information Science is a branch of physics that employs quantum mechanics to study the properties of nature through the use of quantum phenomena such as superposition, entanglement, and interference in order to create, manipulate, store, transmit, or process information more efficiently than classical methods can achieve.[1] 

QIS的一大目标就是利用量子物理定律将经典信息变得更加精确、可靠、高效，并提出相应的算法和模型，进而对现实世界的问题提供新的解决方法。如图1所示，从宏观上看，QIS主要分为三个研究方向，即量子计算、量子通信和量子存储器。前两者属于应用领域，后者则侧重于基础理论研究。



1. 量子计算
Quantum computing refers to techniques for using quantum effects—such as superposition, entanglement, and interference—to perform computation tasks more efficiently than conventional digital computers can provide.[2] The ability to harness these effects requires transforming classical algorithms into quantum ones that utilize both quantum mechanical principles and computer hardware designed specifically for handling qubits. 

2. 量子通信
Quantum communication allows us to exchange large amounts of data at high speeds over long distances without the need for transmission errors. This is made possible by encoding each bit of data into an equal superposition of multiple states, which are then transmitted through noisy channels. 

3. 量子存储器
Quantum memories have been proposed as a way to address the limitations of standard magnetic storage devices by exploiting quantum mechanical effects like decoherence and entanglement. These devices promise faster read/write times and greater capacity than traditional RAM chips. 


目前，在这三大研究方向中，量子计算已经取得了非常大的突破。它的发展历史可以追溯到1981年费曼教授提出的著名论文——The Quantum Theory of Computation，其后由于量子信息理论的诞生，量子计算机已经具备了实用价值。而量子通信和量子存储器的发展也表明了技术领先的势头。在未来的研究方向中，还有包括量子机器学习、计算物理、纠缠处理、量子控制等等。


2.核心概念与联系

首先，我们要了解一下QIS中的一些基本概念。

## Qubit（量子比特）
A qubit (pronounced /ˈkwaɪbuθ/) is a quantum physical system consisting of two identical regions where electromagnetic radiation cannot escape. Inside one region there are holes called spin-up (σ+) and spin-down (σ-) states; outside there are electrons with spins pointing towards each other known as spin-direction (±). These form the basis of the qubit state space and allow for the creation of quantum states that behave similarly to classic bits of information. A single qubit can be described mathematically using a Dirac notation, which represents its four wave function components: $|0⟩$ and $|1⟩$. Its amplitude (or probability distribution) on the basis vectors $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ may also be expressed in terms of its square root magnitude $√|0\rangle|^2+√|1\rangle|^2$, but this is not required for practical purposes. 

To understand what happens when we interact with a qubit, it's important to keep in mind that all interactions are probabilistic: even small changes to the initial configuration could result in a different final outcome. Therefore, quantum systems must work together to generate meaningful outcomes based on probabilities and correlations between them. This is why quantum gates act to change a system's overall behavior from either applying an X gate (which maps |0⟩ to |1⟩ and vice versa), or changing its position within a beamsplitter to focus energy onto particular parts of the state vector. Finally, there are some specific types of operations that can only occur naturally on quantum systems: random measurements of the system, such as the measurement of a spin along one direction versus another. 

In summary, qubits are the fundamental unit of quantum information processing and provide a powerful framework for manipulating complex quantum systems, enabling new applications such as machine learning, quantum simulations, and cryptography. 

## Superposition （超导）
Superposition is the property of a quantum state that causes it to exist in multiple distinct states simultaneously. When a particle starts out in a single state, any interaction with an external field creates a second state that mixes with the original one to create a superposition. As a particle moves around the Bloch sphere, it experiences a rotating frame of reference, allowing it to enter various configurations within the many-body Hilbert space of possibilities created by the rotation. 

By contrast, in classical digital circuits, if input signals arrive at different times, they will interfere with each other until they meet somewhere that allows their signals to pass through unimpeded. However, this cannot happen in a quantum circuit, because quantum effects such as superposition mean that every input signal affects the entire quantum state differently depending on how closely they align with the existing state.

Therefore, the concept of superposition is central to quantum computation and can play a role in the performance of various tasks, including encryption and error correction. For example, when two copies of a message are encoded separately and combined using quantum logic gates, the resulting output would appear to be gibberish until the receiver attempts to decode it. This is particularly relevant in cases where both messages being communicated contain the same type of information (for example, telephone numbers or credit card numbers) or require frequent switching among different messages (like video streaming services).

## Entanglement （关联）
Entanglement is a physical manifestation of quantum superposition, which occurs when two particles have become entangled and continue to move around in synch. This means that although they are each in a separate subspace of the full Hilbert space, they effectively share half of their quantum state with each other. Thus, despite the fact that the individual particles are in different positions and orientations, they still collectively hold much of the same information.

For instance, suppose Alice wants to send a secret message to Bob who has sent him an entangled qubit. If she tells him her message before he receives the entangled qubit, he won't know which copy of the message she intended to send and will most likely misinterpret it. Likewise, if Alice sends him her message after he has received the entangled qubit, his interpretation might be wrong due to the entanglement. One way to avoid these issues is to establish key exchange protocols early on before sending any encrypted information, so that participants always know which copy of the message belongs to whom. Additionally, entangled qubits offer advantages in distributed computing paradigms such as fault tolerance and parallelism, as multiple processors or nodes can operate independently yet remain linked together underneath the hood.

Finally, the basic concept of entanglement applies across several levels of complexity and abstraction, ranging from individual qubits to larger distributed systems involving billions of interacting elements. Whether you're working on a simple protocol or building a multi-million dollar business application, the benefits of exploring the world of quantum information will undoubtedly help unlock new possibilities for humanity.
