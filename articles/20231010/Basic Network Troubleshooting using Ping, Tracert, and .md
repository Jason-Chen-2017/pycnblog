# 1.背景介绍


The internet is a vast network of interconnected devices that communicate with each other to exchange data or services over the world-wide web. It's important for network engineers to know how to troubleshoot various issues related to networking such as connectivity, performance, security, and configuration problems. In this article, we will learn basic methods used to troubleshoot networking issues by using tools like ping, tracert, and telnet. We will also discuss some common networking issues and provide step-by-step instructions on how to troubleshoot them. The goal is to provide valuable insights into troubleshooting common network problems so that they can be identified, diagnosed, and resolved effectively.

Here are some key terms you should understand before proceeding further with our article:

1. IP Address - An Internet Protocol (IP) address identifies a device connected to the internet. Each device has an IP address which consists of four numbers separated by dots. For example, 192.168.0.1
2. DNS - Domain Name System (DNS) allows humans to access websites through simple text strings rather than remembering complex IP addresses. A DNS server maintains a database mapping domain names to their corresponding IP addresses.
3. Routing Table - The routing table lists all available routes between any two network nodes in the local area network (LAN). Every time a new computer connects to the LAN, it must be configured with the appropriate route(s) to reach other computers on the LAN.
4. Port Number - A port number specifies a specific application running on a computer that listens for incoming connections. Each service provided by a device typically runs on one or more ports. Examples of commonly used ports include HTTP (port 80), HTTPS (port 443), SSH (port 22), SMTP (port 25), etc.

Ping Command: This command is used to check if a particular host (IP address or domain name) is reachable from your computer. Simply type "ping" followed by the target hostname/IP address in your terminal window. If successful, it will display information about the response received from the destination machine, including its IP address, latency, packet loss rate, etc. Here are the steps involved in executing the ping command:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal window on your computer.
2. Type "ping" followed by the target hostname/IP address in the command line. For example, “ping google.com”.
3. Wait for the program to execute and respond with details about the result. 
4. If the connection is successful, it will show the round trip time (RTT) taken to send a request and receive a reply back from the remote host. Additionally, it will show the percentage of packets lost during the transmission process.

Troubleshooting Common Problems Using Ping: 

1. Packet Loss Rate Exceeded: This occurs when there is no response from the targeted machine within the specified timeout period. To troubleshoot, try increasing the timeout value or checking for network connectivity issues on both ends of the link (e.g., firewall rules, VPN tunnel status, etc.). Also make sure the remote host is accessible and accepting requests.
2. ICMP Blocked: ICMP traffic may be blocked by a firewall on either end of the link or VPN tunnel. Check the firewall settings to see if ICMP traffic is allowed. Use a different protocol such as TCP instead.
3. Firewall or Network Configuration Issues: Check the firewall logs to see what is blocking the traffic. Make sure necessary protocols are open, such as TCP, UDP, and ICMP. Verify the network configuration settings to ensure that everything is working properly.
4. High Latency or Unstable Connection: When RTT values are high or unusually slow, it could indicate a network problem. Try using another network provider or configuring a static IP address. Also, use tools like traceroute and speedtest to identify potential bottlenecks in the path of the communication. 

Traceroute Command: The traceroute command works by sending probe packets to multiple hosts along the way to determine where the data flowing across the network is being routed. The probes measure the round-trip delay (RTT) between each pair of adjacent routers until the final hop reached by the packet arrives at its destination. The output shows the complete route taken by the packet throughout the network. 

Here are the steps involved in executing the traceroute command:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal window on your computer.
2. Type "tracert" followed by the target hostname/IP address in the command line. For example, “tracert google.com”.
3. Wait for the program to execute and respond with details about the route taken by the probe packets.

Troubleshooting Common Problems Using Traceroute:

1. Packet Loss Rate Exceeded: Similar to the ping command, packet loss rate exceeded errors can occur due to network congestion or incorrect routing configurations. However, keep in mind that traceroute doesn’t measure actual packet loss rates but only the distance between hops along the path. Therefore, even though individual packets might be dropped, the trace still represents the true travel time. By default, Windows systems set a maximum limit of 30 hops per trace, but macOS and Linux allow up to 30 seconds before giving up. Increase the TTL value (time-to-live) or configure correct route tables to reduce packet loss rate.
2. Timed Out Error: The traceroute tool uses ICMP echo requests and replies to determine the route taken by the packets. Depending on the environment and network topology, these messages can be blocked or filtered by the network infrastructure. Try adjusting the timeout parameters or switching to a different protocol.
3. Firewall or Network Configuration Issues: As with the ping and traceroute commands, verify the firewall and network configuration settings to ensure that they aren't blocking or altering the traffic.

Telnet Command: Telnet is a popular command-line tool used to remotely log into a system or perform administrative tasks via a virtual terminal. It enables users to connect to a remote computer, issue commands, and view results. There are many ways to utilize the telnet client software depending on the operating system installed on the local computer and the remote computer.

The most common method involves typing "telnet" followed by the target hostname/IP address in the terminal window. Here are the steps involved in executing the telnet command:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal window on your computer.
2. Type "telnet" followed by the target hostname/IP address in the command line. For example, “telnet www.example.com”.
3. Press Enter to establish a connection with the remote computer.
4. Wait for authentication credentials to be entered. These vary depending on the level of access requested and the permissions assigned to the user account connecting to the system.
5. Once authenticated, you'll have full shell access to the remote computer and can run commands as needed. To exit the session, simply press Ctrl+] followed by “quit” and then press Enter.

Troubleshooting Common Problems Using Telnet:

1. Authentication Failure: If the username or password entered is incorrect, you may get a message indicating failure. Review the permissions assigned to the user account and confirm that the proper authentication credentials were entered.
2. Network Connectivity Issues: Ensure that the network cables are properly plugged in, the switch ports are enabled, and the firewall settings don’t block the traffic. Use utilities like netstat and ping to troubleshoot connectivity issues.
3. Remote Shell Access Denied: If the user account does not have permission to access the remote shell, you may receive a "Permission denied" error. Confirm that the user account has the required privileges and review the remote system settings.
