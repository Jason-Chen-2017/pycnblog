## Introduction
The debris of planetary systems may have impacted on the stability or motion of some of its components. The existence of such unstable regions can significantly affect human life as they pose threats to habitability of these planets. These effects are known as atmospheric instabilities, which may cause damages to infrastructure and even disrupt economies and cultures. Therefore, it is crucial to design a safe and effective way for colonizing and exploiting these unstable regions around other terrestrial bodies that could be habitable. One possible method is to use pulsars as launch vehicles towards planetary systems with high probability of forming a stable orbit. 

In this paper, we focus on one particular type of astronomical pulsars - those whose magnetic fields align with their rotation axis, i.e., precessional. We first present an overview of the historical development of precession in solar system objects from their formation up till today. Then we discuss how astronomical pulsars arise out of compact stars as the result of magnetic precession in the central region. Next, we analyze the physics of spinning precession using theoretical models. Finally, we examine various methods used to detect and characterize precession events in astronomical pulsars. Our results suggest that precession in astronomical pulsars plays a significant role in generating planetary orbits close to the Earth's equator. This work provides insights into the mechanism of planetary formation through magnetic field precession in astronomical pulsar systems, and highlights the importance of utilizing these pulsars in the search for habitable planets near their hosts.

## Core concepts and relationships
### Planetary Orbits
A planet's orbit is a path that the planet takes around the Sun in elliptical, circular, orbits, or parabolic orbits. As astronomers continue to observe more complex orbital configurations such as hyperbolic, orbits, elliptic orbits include the most commonly observed types. Planet orbits usually revolve around two main axes: the ascending node, defined as the point where the line connecting the centers of the object and the Sun intersects the plane of the sky, and the periapsis, also known as apogee, is the point along the orbit closest to the planet. Different types of orbits are often associated with different physical conditions on the host star, e.g., low temperature, metallicity, or presence of gas giants. At any given moment, the position of the planet relative to the Sun depends on both the distance between them, called the semi-major axis, and the angle between the positions projected onto the sky. In general, smaller orbits lead to smaller mass planets while larger orbits yield greater masses. However, there are cases where very large orbits exist and sustained migration between orbits can occur due to supernovae or cosmic rays. Despite their complexity, all planetary orbits ultimately depend on the properties of the star hosting them, including its luminosity, composition, age, radius, and rotation period.

### Precession
Precession is the periodic change of orientation of an object’s axis due to the influence of the rotation of the observer. It is a fundamental property of celestial bodies such as the Sun, Moon, and planets. The precise timing of changes in the precession of the rotation axis varies depending on the body being considered and the observers viewing direction. Although it has been studied extensively in many disciplines for centuries, recent years have seen increasing interest in understanding the mechanisms behind precession processes and their application to practical problems such as radio telescopes and spacecraft navigation.

The primary concept underlying precession is the notion of chiral symmetry. A group of particles sharing the same spatial arrangement but changing directions of motion are said to be symmetrically equivalent if the particle undergoes the same transformation when viewed from either side of the center of rotation. While this definition assumes that the rotational axis does not move relative to the reference frame, it captures the essence of how precession works in nature. Precession can be classified based on the angular frequency of the precession cycle, denoted $\omega$. The slowest frequencies ($\omega < \pi$) exhibit much shorter periods than fast ones ($\omega > \pi$), which suggests that small variations in the rotation of the axis occur over long timescales. Some example precession cycles include sidereal day ($\omega = \frac{2 \pi}{23^{h}}$, $h=1, 2, 3$), synodic month ($\omega = \frac{2 \pi}{29^m}$, $m=1, 2, 3,...$), and tropical year ($\omega = \frac{2 \pi}{365}$).

Another important feature of precession is the amplitude of the precession. This refers to the amount by which the axis of rotation varies in length over the course of a single precession cycle. There are several ways to measure the amplitude of precession. For instance, Grand Irene Vector and other ambient rotating segments provide the best estimate of the actual amount of precession during each complete precession cycle. Another approach uses measurements made by various stellarators attached to the solar wind. By comparing the values obtained by multiple investigations, the maximum and minimum differences can reveal the amplitude of precession.

Finally, the rate of precession describes the speed at which the precession cycle occurs. Specifically, it measures the number of complete precession cycles completed within a given time interval. If the rate is constant, then no precession happens over a longer timescale compared to the shortest precession cycle. Interestingly, the laws of thermodynamics indicate that energy is conserved in a closed system, so the absence of external influences should increase the rate of precession of a closed system without causing any observable changes in the environment. Nonetheless, natural phenomena such as weather patterns and geochemical reactions can produce sudden fluctuations in the rate of precession, creating interesting perspectives for understanding the origin of earthquakes and turbulent flows.
