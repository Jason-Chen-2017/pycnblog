# 1.背景介绍


Transportation systems are widely used in many fields such as industry, economy, and science. The importance of transportation has become increasingly recognized in the past decades, which has led to an exponential growth in the use of communication technology in cities around the world. As a result, urban transportation systems have experienced significant development over the years, including more intelligent vehicles, better connectivity, and increased capacity to handle diverse demands. However, this development brings with it numerous challenges that need to be addressed by both researchers and policymakers. In addition, transportation network planning plays a crucial role in ensuring efficient resource allocation for various services provided by transportation systems. 

In recent years, there has been growing interest in multi-objective optimization (MO) techniques for optimizing complex transportation networks. MO techniques can help transportation engineers and planners identify optimal solutions to complex problems involving multiple objectives, constraints, and decision variables. Despite their potential applications, however, the literature on MO methods for transportation networks is limited. This paper presents a literature review of multi-objective optimization approaches in transport networks from academia and industries. It discusses the existing algorithms, heuristics, and mathematical models used in solving various problems related to transportation networks, such as vehicle routing problems, capacitated vehicle routing problems, multimodal transportation assignment problem, etc. Moreover, we highlight several open issues in transportation network optimization and provide future directions for research. 

2.核心概念与联系
Multi-objective optimization (MO) refers to the process of finding the best solution among many possible solutions based on multiple criteria or objectives rather than just one single criterion or objective. MO methods seek to find tradeoffs between different desirable properties or characteristics of the system under consideration. MO is commonly applied in areas such as engineering design, business, and management. Although MO has been successfully applied to solve various problems, its application in transportation networks has not been extensively studied due to the complexity and dimensionality involved in these networks. To address this gap, this article focuses on analyzing and comparing various algorithms, strategies, and mathematical models used in MO approach for transportation networks. 

A transportation network is composed of interconnected roads, railways, airports, parks, and other infrastructure components. Vehicles travel through these networks to perform various services such as delivering packages, moving goods, distributing energy, or providing public transportation. According to the definition given above, transportation networks can be modeled as a graph or a network consisting of nodes and edges. Each node represents a point where two or more vehicles meet at some time instant, while each edge represents a physical link connecting the endpoints of a road or a railway. The transportation network also includes traffic conditions affecting the flow of vehicles, such as speed limits, congestion levels, and lane usage patterns. Thus, transportation networks require powerful computing power, high storage capacity, and reliable data collection mechanisms to ensure effective planning and operation. Additionally, they must adapt to constant changes in traffic conditions, mobility trends, and new technologies that may emerge over time. 

In order to optimize transportation networks, various types of problems arise depending on the nature of the services being provided by the transportation network. These include shortest path routing, vehicle routing problems, and multimodal transportation assignment problems. Shortest path routing involves determining the least cost path from one node to another. Vehicle routing problems involve allocating a set of customers or jobs to a fleet of vehicles to minimize total distance traveled or cargo delivered. Multimodal transportation assignment problems aim to find the most efficient way to transport goods across multiple modes of transportation simultaneously. 

The following subsections will focus on these three types of problems and how they can be solved using various MO methods.

Shortest Path Routing Problem
One of the first problems tackled by the transportation network community was the shortest path routing problem. Given a source node and destination node, the goal of this problem is to determine the least cost path connecting them. One common approach to solving this problem is called Dijkstra's algorithm, which uses a priority queue to keep track of the cheapest known paths from the source vertex until all vertices are visited. Another approach is Floyd Warshall algorithm, which computes the shortest path distances between every pair of vertices in a weighted graph. Despite their simplicity, these algorithms prove to be very useful in practice. While their theoretical performance is good enough, they do not take into account additional factors such as traffic conditions, mobility trends, and traffic jams, making them unsuitable for real-world transportation networks. Therefore, more advanced optimization techniques such as evolutionary algorithms, genetic algorithms, or particle swarm optimization are required for practical applications.

Vehicle Routing Problem
The vehicle routing problem consists of assigning a fixed number of customers or jobs to a fleet of vehicles in a minimum amount of time without violating any constraint or condition. The main challenge in solving this problem is determining the optimal assignment of customers/jobs to vehicles so as to maximize overall profit. Several approaches have been developed to solve this problem, including column generation, stochastic shortest path covering, ant colony optimization, genetic algorithms, and integer programming. Column generation is a popular technique that generates candidate solutions incrementally, starting with empty columns and gradually adding customers until the feasible region is covered. Other techniques like stochastic shortest path covering generate candidate solutions randomly, typically starting with small coverings and progressively adding larger ones until all customers are assigned. Most recently, artificial neural networks (ANNs), particularly deep learning ANNs, have shown great promise for solving this class of problems. 

Multimodal Transportation Assignment Problem
The multimodal transportation assignment problem aims to assign multiple requests (e.g., vehicles, jobs, or packages) to different routes, with each request having its own specific preferences and constraints. The goal of the problem is to minimize the overall costs associated with fulfilling these requirements while satisfying all preferences and constraints. Common optimization techniques include combinatorial auctions, mixed-integer linear programs, and mixed-integer quadratic programs. Mixed-integer linear programs attempt to allocate requests to routes while taking into account their individual attributes such as duration, velocity, waiting time, fuel consumption, etc. Mixed-integer quadratic programs generalize these concepts by allowing for non-linear relationships between request attributes and route attributes. They can handle complicated constraints, but often suffer from longer computation times compared to linear programs. Recent advancements in hybrid solvers combining linear and quadratic programming can offer improved performance in certain cases.
