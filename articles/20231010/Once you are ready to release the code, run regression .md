# 1.背景介绍


Code testing is essential in any software development process and ensuring that the code works as intended is important for maintaining its quality and robustness. However, keeping a high level of confidence with the quality of the product requires continual effort on both technical and business sides to verify and validate the application's correct functioning across multiple dimensions including performance, scalability, security, usability, functionality, compatibility, and reliability. 

In this blog post, we will discuss various types of automated tests like unit test, integration test, acceptance test, functional test, smoke test, regression test, stress test, user acceptance test, and load test and how they can be used during the CI/CD pipeline to ensure smooth delivery of applications into production environments.

There are several types of automated tests commonly used by developers to test their code:

1. Unit Testing - This type of testing involves testing individual modules or units of the application such as functions, classes or components. It usually involves writing simple test cases which simulate expected inputs and outputs from different scenarios to detect bugs early before it impacts the overall functionality of the application.

2. Integration Testing - In this type of testing, multiple modules or components of an application work together to provide a specific output. The goal is to identify errors related to inter-module communication, data handling, file I/O operations, and interface design.

3. Functional Testing - Functional testing verifies whether the core functionality of the application performs as designed. Here, a set of input conditions are provided and the system should generate the expected output accordingly. Apart from traditional manual testing, this method also utilizes tools like Selenium Webdriver and Appium to automate UI testing.

4. Acceptance Testing - This type of testing involves users interacting with the application under certain use cases and scenarios. The primary purpose is to identify any issues related to requirements or specifications and address them before going live.

5. Smoke Test - As the name suggests, smoke testing refers to a basic check of an application’s health and usability. It helps to quickly determine if there are any obvious issues that could cause damage to the application. These checks include running through typical use cases, performing exploratory testing, and checking for common mistakes. 

6. Regression Test - This type of testing ensures that previously fixed defects do not reappear within the same code base. If new bugs are introduced due to changes made earlier, regression testing identifies these issues before they affect downstream processes.

7. Stress Test - Stress testing simulates higher traffic volumes and extreme levels of usage to ensure that the application handles large loads gracefully. It also evaluates the application's response time and throughput capacity to handle peak loads.

8. User Acceptance Test (UAT) - UAT involves testing the application with real-world end users to evaluate its effectiveness and usability. This includes conducting usability testing sessions with actual users, collecting feedback, and addressing any issues found during testing.

9. Load Test - This type of testing simulates heavy workload to the application to assess its ability to cope up with unexpected spikes in traffic volume. The key objective here is to identify bottlenecks and understand the limits of the application's processing power.

The following diagram shows how each type of test fits into the entire testing cycle:


Each stage of the testing cycle includes planning, preparation, execution, analysis, reporting, and verification. Depending on the nature of the application being tested and its criticality, different sets of tests may need to be executed. For instance, critical applications require more rigorous testing than less critical ones. Therefore, continuous integration and continuous deployment strategies can help organizations achieve optimal results with fewer disruptions and downtime.

We will now go over some popular automated testing frameworks available today, along with their features and capabilities. Let's start with JUnit framework.

JUnit is one of the most widely used Java testing frameworks, and it provides support for creating and executing automated tests. Below are some of the main concepts of JUnit framework:

1. Annotations - Annotations are special keywords that are added to methods or classes in order to specify metadata about those elements. They are used by JUnit to define tests, fixtures, parameters, and other information needed to perform testing.

2. Assertions - Assertions are boolean expressions used to assert that a condition holds true at runtime. When an assertion fails, it means that the program state has changed beyond what was expected. It indicates that something went wrong, either because of incorrect logic or a programming error.

3. Fixtures - Fixtures are objects used to initialize or setup the testing environment. They involve preparing the database, creating files or directories required for testing, starting servers or services, and initializing caches or session stores. 

4. Rules - Rules are extensions to JUnit that allow customizing the behavior of JUnit tests using annotations. They typically serve as convenient ways to group related tests into larger logical units. 

Here are some of the steps involved in writing and executing JUnit tests:

1. Create a new Java class for your test case, annotate it with @Test annotation, and write your test methods inside it. Each test method should have a meaningful name and should cover a small piece of functionality. You can use assertions to verify the output of the test against known values.

2. Use AssertEquals() method instead of assertEquals() when comparing two integer values. This makes sure that the comparison is done correctly without any rounding errors caused by floating point arithmetic.

3. Run the test using a build tool like Maven or Gradle. The build tool would automatically compile the code and run all the tests included in the project.

4. Debugging tests can be challenging but with proper debugging techniques and breakpoints, they become much easier. There are many tools available online for Java debugging like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, etc., which make it easy to set breakpoints, step through the code, examine variables, and debug multi-threaded programs.

5. When running tests on a Continuous Integration server, you can configure Jenkins to execute the tests after every commit or merge. This way, you can get immediate feedback on the status of your changes and catch potential issues early.

Some common built-in rules in JUnit include RetryRule, ExpectedExceptionRule, TemporaryFolder, Timeout, Category, ClassRule, and MethodRule. These can be used to customize the behavior of JUnit tests, reduce boilerplate code, enforce contract compliance, and improve test flexibility.

Similarly, we can look at other popular testing frameworks like PHPUnit, Pytest, Nose, Robot Framework, and Fitnesse. They share similar principles, syntax, and APIs, making them familiar and easy to learn for existing engineers.
