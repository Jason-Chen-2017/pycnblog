# 1.背景介绍


This article will discuss how to modernize a legacy system without the need for any coding or scripting language by leveraging Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) tools such as IBM BlueMix, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Microsoft Azure cloud services. This is not an easy task due to many technical challenges that must be overcome before even starting the migration process. The main purpose of this article is to provide practical guidance on how to approach and execute a successful PaaS-based migration project from scratch to production. Additionally, we will also highlight some lessons learned during this migration journey, including the importance of testing early and often in order to catch errors earlier and prevent downtime. Finally, we will summarize our findings into recommendations for anyone planning to undertake similar migrations.

Legacy systems are commonly seen in organizations today, but they can represent significant risks if not properly managed and maintained. They may still have critical functionality, performance requirements, and data sensitivity issues that cannot be addressed quickly enough. Organizations must continue delivering business functions while ensuring security, scalability, availability, and reliability so their mission stays on track. However, these goals become more difficult when it comes to replacing outdated systems with newer ones that do not require application development expertise or manual intervention. 

In contrast, Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) platforms offer prebuilt solutions that abstract away underlying hardware and software details, allowing developers to focus on building applications faster than ever before. By migrating to one of these platforms, organizations can reduce their IT costs and simplify maintenance. Additionally, PaaS platforms offer built-in features like monitoring, logging, backup, scaling, and load balancing that allow organizations to easily manage their infrastructure and ensure optimal performance and resiliency.

To successfully migrate a legacy system onto a PaaS platform, you will need to identify your target environment, plan your migration pathway, implement new technologies, integrate third-party components, and test thoroughly. In this blog post, we'll walk through the steps involved in setting up a PaaS-based migration project, highlighting key takeaways along the way. Let's get started!

# 2. Core Concepts and Related Technologie

## Platform-as-a-Service

Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) refers to cloud computing model where cloud vendors offer hosted services that include database hosting, server management, network connectivity, storage, and other essential capabilities needed to build and run complex enterprise applications. These services make it easier for businesses to deploy applications and create robust, reliable systems at lower cost. Instead of purchasing and maintaining the entire infrastructure required to run an application, businesses use PaaS providers who handle these tasks for them, saving time and money.

There are several different types of PaaS clouds:

* Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS): Provides basic compute power, networking resources, and storage capacity.
* Software-as-a-Service (SaaS): Allows users to access ready-made software applications. Examples include Salesforce, Zoho, Gmail, and Dropbox.
* Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS): Enables businesses to develop and host applications without having to worry about servers, operating systems, databases, and middleware. Developers just need to write code, upload files, and select libraries.

These PaaS options cover a wide range of technology stacks, including languages such as Node.js, Java,.NET, PHP, Ruby, Python, Go, Scala, Clojure, and Docker containers. Businesses choose which one suits their needs best based on their budget and specific application requirements.

The most popular PaaS providers currently include Google Cloud Platform, AWS, and Microsoft Azure. Each provider offers a suite of services that enable businesses to move fast without being concerned about high-level architecture or operational complexity. Although each provider has its own unique characteristics, all three share common core principles and features that help keep businesses agile, secure, and scalable.

## Benefits of Using PaaS Tools for Legacy Systems Migration

### Reduced Time to Market and Costs

PaaS provides a turnkey solution to modernization projects by providing prebuilt environments that save time and money for organizations looking to replace older systems. Without needing to invest heavily in hardware or software upgrades, PaaS solutions offer organizations flexibility and ease of deployment.

Using a PaaS tool allows organizations to quickly provision a highly available, fault-tolerant system with minimal upfront investment. Furthermore, PaaS solutions come with a vast selection of integrated technologies that help organizations streamline processes, increase efficiency, and automate operations. Overall, the value proposition of PaaS platforms means organizations can spend more time developing applications and less time managing infrastructure.

### Simplified Operations

Since PaaS solutions offer integrated tools and automation, businesses can reduce their IT overhead significantly. With PaaS solutions, organizations can automatically scale out or in depending on demand, monitor resource utilization, and perform backups and restores with little effort. Furthermore, integrating with SaaS services such as database as a service (DBaaS) makes it much easier to manage and optimize data across multiple applications.

Overall, PaaS platforms greatly reduce the complexity of modernization projects, making it easier for businesses to switch to new technologies and leverage existing skills.

### Improved Security

Security concerns are paramount in modernization projects, especially those involving sensitive data. Since PaaS solutions typically run on virtual machines running in the cloud, organizations can benefit from the advanced security measures provided by cloud providers. From firewalls and antivirus software to intrusion detection, DDoS protection, and identity and access management (IAM), PaaS solutions protect customers' data at every step of the process.

Additionally, PaaS solutions help to address many regulatory compliance requirements by enabling organizations to meet HIPPA, PCI-DSS, and FERPA compliance standards with minimal extra effort.

By choosing a PaaS vendor, organizations can further enhance their overall security stance and achieve compliance within their internal policies and procedures.

### Lower TCO and Increased Flexibility

Cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure have enabled companies to lower their total cost of ownership (TCO) and gain increased flexibility by taking advantage of platform as a service (PaaS) solutions. These providers offer infrastructure and tools that abstract away low-level technicalities, making it easier for organizations to use PaaS solutions to modernize their systems.

For example, AWS Elastic Beanstalk simplifies deploying web applications and APIs to the cloud. It automates provisioning, configuration, and management of the underlying infrastructure, reducing the amount of time and expense spent on managing the environment. Similarly, Google App Engine enables developers to quickly build and deploy scalable web apps without having to worry about backend infrastructure. Both solutions offer built-in auto-scaling, load balancing, and health checks, which make it possible for organizations to rapidly adjust workload as needed.

Overall, PaaS solutions allow organizations to improve their speed and agility by focusing on solving problems that traditional software development would otherwise struggle with. Companies should consider using PaaS for their next big transformation project to help them minimize risk and maximize profitability.
