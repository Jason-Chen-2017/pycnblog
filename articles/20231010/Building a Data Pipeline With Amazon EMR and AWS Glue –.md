# 1.背景介绍


Data pipelines are essential to modern data processing systems as they transform raw data into valuable insights for businesses. Although there exist several open-source frameworks that help users build data pipelines, the majority of these solutions rely on programming languages like Java or Python.

In this article, we will learn how to create an end-to-end data pipeline using Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) and AWS Glue services. We will also learn about key concepts related to building a data pipeline with EMR and Glue and their interrelationship. 

We assume that you have basic knowledge in cloud computing technologies such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Hadoop ecosystem tools, databases, data structures, programming languages, etc. If not, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with them before proceeding further. 

Before starting our tutorial, make sure your AWS account has been properly configured by following the instructions here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-gs-launch-sample-cluster.html. You can also use the provided sample code available at GitHub repository located here: https://github.com/aws-samples/data-pipeline-demo.

## 2.1 Introduction to Hadoop Ecosystem Tools 
Hadoop Ecosystem Tools includes various components that work together to provide distributed storage, processing, and analysis capabilities. The main components of the Hadoop ecosystem are Apache Hadoop, Apache Hive, Apache Pig, Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, Apache Zookeeper, and Apache Oozie. 

Apache Hadoop is a framework for storing and processing large datasets across multiple nodes in a cluster. It provides high availability and fault tolerance through replication and automatic failover mechanism. Hadoop clusters consist of HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator), and MapReduce (a programming model used for parallel data processing).

Apache Hive is a SQL-like language built on top of Hadoop's core libraries, which allows users to interact with stored data in a relational way. Hive is commonly used for ad-hoc queries against structured data sets that do not require complex joins or aggregations.

Apache Pig is a high-level platform for creating dataflows, which allow users to perform complex operations on large amounts of data using a scripting language called Pig Latin. Pig is often used when users need to extract, transform, load (ETL) data from different sources.

Apache Spark is a fast and general-purpose engine for big data processing that supports batch, real-time, and streaming computation. Spark runs programs written in Scala, Java, or Python on Hadoop, Apache Cassandra, HBase, or any other Hadoop compatible file system.

Apache Kafka is a distributed messaging service that enables applications to publish and subscribe to streams of records. It is designed to be scalable, fault-tolerant, and resilient to distributed failures. Kafka uses a message queue architecture where producers send messages to topics, and consumers read those messages from the same topic.

Apache Zookeeper is a centralized coordination service for distributed systems that provides synchronization primitives and manages configuration information. Zookeeper ensures that all clients accessing a shared resource get the most recent version of the data.

Apache Oozie is a workflow scheduler that handles Apache Hadoop jobs. It helps manage job dependencies, assign resources, control execution flow, and monitor job status. It integrates with other Hadoop ecosystem tools such as Hive, Pig, and Sqoop for running map-reduce, pig, and sqoop jobs, respectively.

## 2.2 Key Concepts Related to Building a Data Pipeline with EMR and Glue

### Input Data Source
The input data source could come from any number of sources including databases, files, streaming services, APIs, or third party sources. In our example, we will demonstrate how to ingest data from MySQL database table named “orders” and process the data using AWS Glue crawlers and EMR steps. However, the principles discussed below can easily be applied to other types of input sources.

### Output Data Location
The output data location determines where processed data should go after being transformed by the data pipeline. For instance, if the goal is to store the transformed data in another data lake, then the output data location would point to the appropriate datalake directory. Similarly, if the goal is to update existing data in a database table, the output data location would refer to the relevant database schema and table name.

### Crawlers
Crawlers are automated tasks that periodically retrieve new data from a specified source and process it to extract meaningful insights. They run periodicially and apply rules defined by developers to identify specific patterns within the data. Developers define the fields they want extracted, conditions that must be met, and actions to take once a pattern is identified. When a match occurs, the crawler triggers an action based on predefined logic. Common examples include email notifications, sending alerts, updating dashboards, generating reports, or writing to a data lake.

A typical EMR job flow consists of one or more crawlers that extract data from different sources, followed by transformation, loading, and cleaning steps. Once the raw data is ready for consumption, the next step is to integrate it with downstream analytics tools to generate business value.

To set up a crawler in AWS Glue, follow the guide here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/add-crawler.html. To add a schedule for the crawler, follow the guide here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/monitor-crawlers.html. Finally, to specify the location of the input data, choose either the Database option or the file path option under Targets section while adding a crawler.

### Transforms
Transforms are functions that manipulate data during the data pipeline’s journey from ingestion to its final destination. These transforms can involve filtering, enrichment, aggregation, joining, or any other type of operation needed to clean, organize, or otherwise shape the incoming data.

AWS Glue has a catalog of hundreds of prebuilt transforms that are easy to deploy and reuse. Alternatively, custom user-defined transforms can be created using AWS Lambda or Step Functions. Users simply specify the function signature and input parameters required by each transform.

To create a transform in AWS Glue, navigate to the Transform section under the development menu in the AWS Management Console. Select Add transform button to start defining the necessary details such as the name, description, owner, and implementation script. After deploying the transform, it becomes immediately available for selection when setting up the data pipeline.

### Jobs and Steps
When a job definition is created, a list of dependent objects is created automatically, including crawlers, transforms, and connections to data stores. A job can contain one or more steps, which are individual transformations applied sequentially. Each step takes input data from the previous step and applies a transform to produce output data.

For example, let’s say we have a dataset containing customer orders and we wish to filter out orders placed before December 1st, 2020, group the remaining orders by country, and finally calculate total revenue per country. Here are the steps involved:

1. Define a crawler that polls the order database every hour and retrieves all orders placed since last successful poll.
2. Create a transform that filters out orders placed before Dec. 1st, 2020.
3. Next, group the filtered orders by country using another transform. This transform may involve concatenating multiple columns into a single grouping variable.
4. Finally, compute the total revenue generated by each country using yet another transform. This transform might sum up a column representing the amount paid for each order in a given currency.

These four transforms form a logical sequence, with the output of one transform serving as input to the next step. Using AWS Glue, we can define these transforms and connect them to the appropriate input data sources, data stores, and output locations. Then, we can set up a job to execute these steps periodically and deliver the resulting data to the desired location.
