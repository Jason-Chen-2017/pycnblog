# 1.背景介绍


Data engineering is an important part of the software development process that involves storing, processing and analyzing large amounts of data to support business operations or decision-making. One of the critical aspects of data engineering projects is version control systems like git which are used to track changes made to source code over time. In this article we will focus on advantages of using git in data engineering projects with some examples of how it can be applied in different areas such as data preprocessing, machine learning model training, etc. This article is not a complete guide but rather provides insights into what benefits git brings along with practical guidance on its use in data engineering projects. 

# 2.Core Concepts and Connection
Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers keep track of changes made to their code over time while also allowing them to collaborate with other team members. It has many core concepts including repositories, branches, commits, merge conflicts, tags and remote repository management. The main idea behind these concepts is to enable multiple developers working together on one project without any conflict of interest between them. Additionally, it allows for branching of the codebase which enables parallel development and testing.

## Version Control Systems (VCS)
Version control systems provide a way to manage changes to files over time by tracking changes and maintaining historical records of every modification. Each commit creates a new snapshot of the entire project's directory at that point in time, and each subsequent commit refers back to the previous state of the file(s). This approach makes it easy to revert back to earlier versions if necessary and facilitates collaboration among developers. However, VCS suffer from several disadvantages when dealing with large or complex projects: 

1. Long Commit Times - Many modern VCS have mechanisms for automatically optimizing performance and reducing the amount of work required when making frequent commits. However, these optimizations often come at the cost of slower commit times for small or infrequent commits.
2. Large Repository Size - As more revisions are committed, so does the size of the repository, leading to longer clone times and higher storage costs. 
3. Overhead of Merging Changes - When two or more people are modifying the same file simultaneously, merging those changes becomes challenging. Merge conflicts must be manually resolved, which adds additional overhead and delay to the overall development cycle.

The need for efficient VCS tools continues to grow dramatically due to the increasing scale and complexity of data engineering projects. While there are numerous approaches available for managing code changes over time, git offers several unique features that make it particularly well-suited for data engineering projects. Here are some key features of git that set it apart from other popular VCS tools:

1. Fast Commit Speeds - Unlike traditional centralized version control systems where each change requires synchronization across all clients, git uses a lightweight client architecture. This means that only the changed files are transferred during a commit operation, resulting in significant speed improvements.
2. Efficient Storage Usage - Since git stores each revision independently, it can compress the history and reduce storage requirements compared to traditional VCS tools. Additionally, git uses delta compression techniques to further reduce storage usage.
3. Easy Branch Management - Developers can create separate branches based off of the master branch and experiment freely without affecting the production environment. Branches can later be merged back into the master branch once they have been tested and approved.
4. Flexible Workflow - Git supports a wide range of workflows depending on the developer's needs and preferences. Some common workflow patterns include feature branching, rebase/merge, trunk-based development, and peer review.

By using git for data engineering projects, organizations can significantly reduce the risk associated with long commit times, larger repository sizes, and complex merge scenarios. They can also enjoy faster and more streamlined development cycles thanks to the ease of branch management and the ability to quickly switch between various versions of the codebase. Overall, git provides a powerful tool for managing data engineering projects that provides several unique benefits for organizations looking to adopt a DevOps mindset.
