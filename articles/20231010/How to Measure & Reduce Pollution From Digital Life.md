# 1.背景介绍


India is among the world’s top polluter countries and has one of the highest per capita air pollutants in the world, PM 2.5. However, Indians are also responsible for a significant portion of their carbon footprint - about half of which comes from digital devices such as smartphones, tablets and computers. The number of people using these devices increases every year, and growing usage has put an even greater burden on the environment. While there have been several initiatives over the years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, no consistent mechanism exists to monitor and measure the level of air pollution emitted by individuals who use personal digital devices (PDVs). Thus, it becomes essential to develop new methods to track and manage this pollution effectively. 

To address this issue, we propose an efficient methodology based on computer vision that can accurately identify individual PDVs and measure their levels of PM 2.5 emissions. We plan to evaluate our approach through two experiments: 

1. A pilot study where we test our proposed methodology on a small sample of users to ensure its effectiveness at identifying and measuring PM 2.5 emissions from personal digital devices.

2. An expanded analysis focusing on a large-scale dataset consisting of data collected from multiple cities across different states of India to analyze whether our proposed system can detect and estimate accurate levels of PM 2.5 emissions generated by PDVs across India. This will help us understand the true spread of pollution and explore potential strategies to mitigate it.

This project involves multiple stakeholders including technologists, policy makers, researchers, scientists, engineers and city planners. To implement our solution, we need to collaborate closely with various organizations within the industry, including those involved in governance, regulation, and development efforts around protecting public health, safety, security and environmental consciousness in developing regions. Ultimately, this effort would be crucial in achieving long-term economic growth and climate change mitigation goals for all stakeholders. Our work may not be complete without considering feedback and contributions from the broader community. Nevertheless, I hope this overview gives you a sense of how we intend to move forward with this important project. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or comments!

## Personal digital device（PDV）：
Personal digital device, commonly known as PDV, refers to a computing device equipped with sensors capable of capturing, processing and transmitting information wirelessly via radio waves. These devices include mobile phones, laptops, tablets, set-top boxes, video cameras, microphones, speakers and many more. PDVs are typically portable but can also be worn or held in a bag. Popular examples include Apple iPhones, Samsung Galaxy Tablets, Google Pixel Smartphones, Amazon Fire TV Sticks and Microsoft Xbox One Elite controllers. 


## Air quality management：
Air quality management is the process of managing the distribution and transmission of pollutants into, out of, and within an industrial or residential building, or between buildings and other environments. It includes the proper design, construction, installation, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning of equipment, processes, procedures, policies, practices, programs, standards, guidelines, and communications required to achieve effective air quality control. 

One key component of air quality management is reducing air pollution. Reducing air pollution can improve air quality, reduce energy consumption, enhance comfort during occupancy, and promote healthy habits. As mentioned earlier, India is one of the world's top polluter countries and produces high levels of PM 2.5, which accounts for nearly three quarters of total particulate matter (PM) generation in the country. Therefore, keeping low levels of PM 2.5 is critical to maintaining good air quality and preventing harmful impacts on human health. By identifying and reducing PM 2.5 emissions from PDVs, we can help improve air quality while ensuring our global responsibilities towards climate change.
