The rapid advancement in AM technology has fostered an explosion of new fields and techniques that require state-of-the-art computational methods to overcome their challenges. However, due to the complexity of these fields, it is still difficult for researchers to understand how to approach engineering problems in this field effectively. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-part series of articles on advanced AMF engineering challenges.

We will review key principles such as energy conservation, process simplification, and manufacturing optimization, as well as their effects on system performance and cost. In addition, we will present recent advances made by industry leaders in various areas including polymer matrix science, coating formulation, surface preparation, and chromatography.

In part two, we will study fundamental theoretical issues related to advanced AMF processing using numerical simulations and physical modeling techniques. We will demonstrate how advanced AM techniques can be applied efficiently through massively parallel hardware architectures to enhance performance and scalability. In particular, we will showcase modern high-performance computing platforms and cloud services like Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services that enable large-scale parallelization at low cost.

Finally, in part three, we will apply our knowledge of advanced AMF processing to practical problems such as biosensing, biomedical imaging, and tissue engineering. Specifically, we will discuss how advanced amf processing can help advance medicine and biotechnology, improve patient outcomes, and transform industries relying heavily on cellular materials. We will illustrate examples of advanced amf processing applications across various disciplines and provide insight into future directions.

1、Process Simplification: Process simplification refers to reducing the complexity or dimensionality of a process to increase its efficiency, reduce costs, or maximize yield. This involves identifying redundant steps or unnecessary components, improving productivity, and optimizing process flow. Key principles involved in process simplification include economy of scale, reduced material consumption, enhanced throughput, improved lifetime, increased environmental friendliness, and cost reduction. 

2、Energy Conservation: Energy conservation refers to maintaining constant levels of energy during a process or operation. It ensures consistent temperature, pressure, speed, etc., which are essential for achieving desired performance characteristics. There are several strategies to achieve energy conservation, such as throttling, heat management, and power management. Energy conservation plays a crucial role in achieving optimal performance, especially in complex environments where heating, cooling, and electricity losses can significantly impact product quality and cycle times. 

3、Manufacturing Optimization: Manufacturing optimization involves analyzing existing production processes and procedures and identifying ways to optimize them, focusing on aspects such as resource utilization, timeliness, product yield, and waste minimization. Manufacturing optimization offers several benefits, including faster delivery dates, reduced transportation costs, improved quality control, and enhanced safety.

4、Polymer Matrix Science: Polymer matrix science involves the use of polymers to create solids, liquids, gases, or nanostructures. Understanding the properties of polymer matrices and how they interact with other materials play a significant role in creating robust and durable products. Notably, understanding of the mechanical behavior of polymers enables advanced microfabrication approaches that result in more precise and targeted shape memory alloy production. Additionally, understanding the structure of molecular networks inside polymer matrices enables us to engineer non-conventional shapes, enabling greater flexibility in various applications. 

5、Coating Formulation: Coating formulation is responsible for converting the active ingredients from raw chemical compounds to soft and semi-hard coating forms suitable for application onto the target substrate. Coating formulation is a crucial step in producing desirable results, especially in highly technical applications involving multiple layers of coated media or additives. A number of factors affect the performance of coatings, including the solvent composition, adsorbent composition, viscosity, consistency, and heat treatment rates. Current solutions tend to be poor in terms of consistency and lifetime compared to conventional solvents. Despite these limitations, developing new approaches based on advanced coating sciences can lead to breakthroughs in the coating industry. 

6、Surface Preparation: Surface preparation refers to the preparation of polymer surfaces, usually via electrochemical methods, by treating the underlying matrix and/or adsorbents. Surface preparation takes place after the completion of coating formulation and before the application of amf layer(s). It includes dehydrogenation, hydrolysis, and ion exchange. These processes result in a smooth surface and improve adhesion and interfacial properties of amf layer(s), leading to better cycling and homogeneous bond cleavage. Moreover, drying out of surfaces is another important aspect of surface preparation that helps maintain proper sterility of the amf layer. 

7、Chromatography: Chromatography is the technique used to separate chemical components from solution. Fundamental principles of chromatography include separation of light and heavy ions, differential mobility between phases, and selective ion exchange. Techniques such as gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, thin film chromatography, and mass spectrometry have revolutionized the way chemical information is obtained. Unfortunately, the current generation of chromatography relies primarily on slow and expensive devices, making it impractical for use in real-time analysis of dynamic samples, particularly those occurring under extreme conditions. Recent advancements in chromatographic technology, coupled with efficient algorithms, can offer unprecedented capabilities for fast, accurate data acquisition and analysis in real-time. 

8、High Performance Computing (HPC): HPC refers to dedicated computer clusters designed specifically to perform intensive computations quickly and reliably. Modern high-performance computers possess hundreds of processors and large amounts of local storage, allowing users to run a wide range of applications, ranging from scientific simulation to multimedia rendering. HPC systems are often used to solve challenging computational problems in various fields such as mathematical modeling, medical imaging, financial analytics, and nuclear physics.

9、Cloud Services: Cloud services provide access to remote computing resources on the Internet. They offer flexible pricing models, easy integration with legacy IT infrastructure, and global distribution, making them ideal for running large-scale simulations and big data analysis. Examples of popular cloud service providers include Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. 

10、Bio-Sensing: Bio-sensing is the act of monitoring and measuring physiological or environmental parameters. Many bio-sensing applications rely on nanoscale or microscale amorphous structures or interfaces that can be manipulated using technological tools. Key principles involved in bio-sensing include sensing resolution, signal noise ratio, sensor placement, interface characterization, and stability. Several promising bio-sensing technologies involve advanced electronics, solid-state sensing, and ultrafast optoelectronic systems.

11、Biomedical Imaging: Biomedical imaging refers to the collection and interpretation of images of human or animal tissues or organs, typically under clinical or therapeutic settings. Advancements in fluorescence microscopy, single-molecule imaging, and whole-cell patch clamp recording make it possible to visualize cells, organs, tissues, and fluids under stressful conditions, enabling the identification of diseased regions and pathological processes. Currently, however, most biomedical imaging techniques rely on specialized equipment, are time-consuming, and subject to sample damage and contamination. 

12、Tissue Engineering: Tissue engineering is the art of modifying and reshaping organ systems or tissues, either through mechanical, chemical, or electronic manipulation, depending on the desired outcome. Appropriate modification can have a dramatic effect on the function, morphology, and biochemistry of the resulting tissue, leading to new treatments and diseases. Some of the core principles involved in tissue engineering are effective scaffold design, structurally sound remodeling, and minimization of toxicity. An emerging area of interest is gene editing, which can directly manipulate genes within tissues without altering cells.
