# 1.背景介绍


With the rapid development of internet technology, people are becoming more interested in search engines to find useful information quickly. However, how can we evaluate whether a SERP is credible and informative? In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework for search engine result pages based on perceived usefulness and credibility, which combines textual analysis techniques with machine learning algorithms. We aim to identify the importance of factors that affect users' satisfaction levels when they interact with search results and present the findings towards optimizing user experience in SERPs. Specifically, our proposed method identifies:

1. The perceived usefulness of each search result page by analyzing its content structure, popularity rating, relevance score, and social media engagement. 
2. The credibility of each website's authority and reliability through measuring various attributes such as domain name availability, authoritative site rankings, link integrity, trustworthiness, etc.

The core idea behind these measures is to measure what users consider important when interacting with search results and prioritize websites accordingly. This approach can help improve both quality and relevancy of search results and increase user satisfaction level. Moreover, by identifying the weaknesses or biases in current ranking systems, we can direct our efforts towards developing better ranking models to serve users best interests. 

Overall, our work provides a valuable guideline for designing effective search engine result pages that address the concerns of both users and web developers alike. It aims to optimize the user experience and attract more users to use search engines effectively. With the insights obtained from conducting experiments using this framework, we hope it will be helpful for researchers, industry practitioners, and policymakers to make informed decisions in their search-related projects.

## 2.1 Perceived Usefulness
Perceived usefulness refers to the extent to which a search result appears useful or informative to the user based on certain criteria, such as its content structure, popularity rating, relevance score, and social media engagement. These aspects include things like headlines, images, videos, links, descriptions, keywords used in the content, date of publication, and other features. The overall objective is to provide an estimate of how relevant a webpage is compared to other similarly-ranked ones. A high perceived usefulness indicates that the website provides relevant and useful information to users, while low perceived usefulness indicates that the website does not fulfill any of the desired criteria.

One way to measure perceived usefulness is to analyze its metadata, such as title, description, image captions, key words, and categories assigned to it. Text analytics tools like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and topic modeling can also be used to identify language trends and topics within the content. Similarly, popular search queries related to the subject matter of the webpage can also be analyzed to determine its popularity among users. Relevant searches found on Google can also be counted as an indication of its relative success rate on the internet. Social media engagement metrics like likes and shares can further support the measurement of perceived usefulness by providing signals about how widely spread and liked the content is. Overall, these factors help assess the value of different webpages for a particular purpose. 

In summary, perceived usefulness is determined by several criteria involving content structure, visibility, popularity, relevance, and engagement. 
## 2.2 Credibility
Credibility refers to the degree to which a website possesses legitimacy, authority, and reliability. Different factors may impact credibility, including brand reputation, domain name availability, authoritative site rankings, link integrity, trustworthiness, and timeliness of updates. Domain name availability determines if the website has been registered and hosted properly, while authoritative site rankings indicate the reputation of the website according to external sources. Link integrity checks the authenticity and accuracy of all incoming links to ensure that they do not redirect maliciously. Trustworthiness evaluates the reputation of owners, bloggers, and contributors who have authored or reviewed articles or comments on the website. Timeliness of updates tracks the frequency of changes made to the website over time and helps gauge the responsiveness of the owners.

Based on the above factors, we can measure the credibility of a website by applying appropriate statistical methods such as z-scores, normal distributions, chi-squared tests, t-tests, and ANOVA to compare the data against a benchmark dataset. Our proposed method uses multiple types of textual analysis techniques, including natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and clustering to extract features from the HTML code of the website, content analysis, and social media platforms, respectively. 

Overall, credibility reflects the reputation of the website and how likely it is to deliver accurate, reliable, and timely information to users. By identifying the websites whose content is deemed untrustworthy or irrelevant, we can direct our efforts towards building trustworthy and relevant digital resources.
