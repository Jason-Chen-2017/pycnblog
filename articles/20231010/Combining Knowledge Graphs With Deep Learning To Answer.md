# 1.背景介绍



Healthcare is becoming a major concern for global citizens, especially in the era of AI and artificial intelligence (AI). Healthcare organizations such as hospitals or clinics have their own knowledge graphs which contain rich biomedical information about patients including diseases, medications, procedures, diagnoses, lab results etc. These knowledge graphs can be used to answer complex queries related to medical care such as “What are the symptoms that patients with sarcoidal cystitis experience?” or "What should I prescribe to treat my severe bleeding after having surgery on my leg?" By combining multiple knowledge graphs from different sources, we can effectively learn common patterns and relationships between entities within each graph. However, most existing approaches rely heavily on handcrafted features like text similarity metrics, semantic matching algorithms, or deep neural networks, but these techniques may not capture the complexity of biological processes that occur across disparate areas of expertise and often require external resources such as ontologies or databases. 

In this paper, we propose an approach called Entity Alignment using Neural Networks (EANN) that combines multiple knowledge graphs into one unified representation by learning entity embeddings based on their synonyms and relationships using transfer learning methods and attention mechanisms. We use an ensemble model consisting of two main components: a neural network-based alignment component and a regression model component. The first component estimates the alignment score between entities across all knowledge graphs, enabling us to identify overlapping entities that could benefit from shared representations. The second component uses neural networks to learn non-linear functions that map input entity pairs to scalar scores indicating the likelihood of the relationship being true between them. This allows our system to extract more comprehensive insights from heterogeneous data without relying on specific domain knowledge or prior assumptions. Overall, EANN achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in various healthcare applications, outperforming other approaches by up to several percentage points, particularly when dealing with challenging scenarios where there is no clear ground truth or reliable reference data available.

Knowledge graph(KG) is a structured representation of real world entities and their relations. It consists of three primary components - Subject, Relation, Object (SRO), representing facts or assertions in the form subject–relation–object. KG plays an essential role in many applications such as natural language processing, question answering, fraud detection, social media analytics, recommendation systems, and others. There are various types of KGs ranging from formal logical ontologies, free-text concepts and relationships to relational databases containing structured information. Over time, it has become increasingly popular due to its ability to represent complex interconnected relationships among entities. Although KG provides powerful insights through joint reasoning across multiple domains, building large scale knowledge graphs is expensive and time-consuming task requiring advanced modeling techniques and scalable computation frameworks. Hence, efficient and effective machine learning techniques have emerged as a key enabler towards the development of novel models for managing and processing large amounts of multi-relational data.

In recent years, researchers have proposed numerous techniques to combine multiple knowledge graphs into one unified representation for better understanding of entities and their interactions. Common ways include applying statistical methods such as matrix factorization, clustering, or probabilistic inference, or developing new approaches based on graph neural networks or convolutional neural networks. One promising technique involves aligning entities from different graphs so that they share the same representation space, thus allowing us to leverage shared information to improve performance in downstream tasks. A typical approach involves identifying candidate pairs of entities that might belong to the same concept or object class, performing cross-graph entity linking, and then training neural networks to predict the missing links based on both local and global contextual information. Another approach utilizes transfer learning techniques to adapt learned entity representations from source domains to target domains. Several works have demonstrated that incorporating external knowledge sources such as ontologies or co-occurrence statistics can further boost performance in some application areas. Nevertheless, current solutions still face challenges in handling ambiguous cases and incomplete knowledge graphs. Moreover, their effectiveness depends critically on how well they integrate heterogeneous information across different domains, and lack robustness against noisy labels or outliers.

To address these issues, we propose Entity Alignment using Neural Networks (EANN), which integrates multiple knowledge graphs into one unified representation using an ensemble model composed of a neural network-based alignment component and a regression model component. Our approach involves learning entity embeddings based on their synonyms and relationships using transfer learning methods and attention mechanisms. The first component estimates the alignment score between entities across all knowledge graphs, enabling us to identify overlapping entities that could benefit from shared representations. The second component uses neural networks to learn non-linear functions that map input entity pairs to scalar scores indicating the likelihood of the relationship being true between them. This allows our system to extract more comprehensive insights from heterogeneous data without relying on specific domain knowledge or prior assumptions. Specifically, EANN applies an attention mechanism to focus on important subsets of knowledge graphs during training and prediction time, reducing overfitting and improving generalization. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods even when there is limited supervision or insufficient labeled data, and reduces errors due to noise and ambiguity.

The core algorithm of EANN is as follows:

1. **Preprocessing:** First, we preprocess the knowledge graphs and obtain entity synonym sets and relation triplets.
2. **Transfer Learning:** Next, we perform transfer learning to learn entity embeddings based on their synonyms and relations, using multilingual word embedding vectors trained on large text corpora.
3. **Entity Alignment Estimation:** For each pair of aligned entities, we compute a feature vector representing their syntactic and semantic similarities between the two knowledge graphs. Based on this feature vector, we estimate a soft alignment score between the two entities. 
4. **Attention Mechanism:** During training, we apply an attention mechanism to selectively attend to relevant subset of knowledge graphs based on the estimated alignment scores between entities.
5. **Regression Model Component:** Once we have computed the alignment scores, we train a regression model to predict missing links between entities based on both local and global contextual information.

Here's how our method works in detail:

### Preprocessing Step: 
We begin by preprocessing the knowledge graphs by obtaining entity synonym sets and relation triplets. For instance, let's say we have four knowledge graphs consisting of five entities each, as shown below:
