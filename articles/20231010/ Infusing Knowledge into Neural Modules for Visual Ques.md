# 1.背景介绍


Visual question answering (VQA) is a challenging task due to the need to reason about complex relationships between visual and linguistic inputs in real time. One of the main challenges in VQA is that it requires solving complex interactions among various modules such as image understanding, language modeling, and action recognition, which are often represented by neural networks. However, most existing approaches have only focused on fine-tuning or stacking multiple pre-trained models without integrating knowledge from external sources. In this work, we propose a novel approach to infuse relevant knowledge into deep neural network modules for VQA by leveraging concepts from human cognition. We introduce five human concept categories – color, size, shape, motion, location – that capture complementary aspects of objects, places, actions, events, and situations. Based on these concepts, we design two new feature maps that explicitly encode correlations between different input modalities and corresponding object categories. The resulting features are then combined with low-rank convolutional filters to predict answers directly from the processed representations. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on several VQA benchmarks. Our code will be made publicly available. 

In summary, the key ideas behind our work are: 

1. Introduce five concept categories based on human cognition to capture complementary aspects of objects, places, actions, events, and situations.

2. Design two new feature maps that encode correlations between different input modalities and corresponding object categories.

3. Combine the two new features with low-rank convolutional filters to perform direct prediction on the desired answer category.

4. Conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets to assess the effectiveness of our method. 

5. Release our code for future researchers to leverage the insights gained through our experimentation.

# 2.Core Concepts & Connections
Human cognition has many remarkable capabilities including perception, memory, problem-solving, reasoning, motor control, and learning. These abilities can be used effectively when integrated into computer systems. Among them, vision and language processing provide valuable information for machine intelligence because they allow us to see and understand the world around us. Conversely, while neural networks are known for their ability to learn, they may not always be optimal at representing human concepts accurately. Therefore, recent advances in natural language processing and computer vision have led to an explosion of interest in infusing human knowledge into neural networks for better visual question answering tasks. 

To solve this challenge, we present a novel framework called VQAMT that combines several techniques from deep learning, neuroscience, and cognitive psychology. First, we use commonsense knowledge bases such as WordNet to identify related concepts that could potentially help answer a given VQA query. Then, we apply model-based optimization to find appropriate weights for each concept category during training. This step involves analyzing how concepts relate to one another in terms of their activation patterns across layers in the network. By doing so, we are able to train separate feature maps that specifically target each concept category. Next, we also combine these features with low-rank convolutional filters that project the representation onto a shared space, making it easier for the network to generalize well to unseen scenarios. Finally, we evaluate our approach using a diverse set of benchmarks to measure its performance on various visual question answering tasks.

Overall, the key idea behind our work is to integrate human knowledge into neural network modules for VQA by mapping concepts captured in humans’ brains to different neural network layers. This integration allows the system to automatically select relevant concepts to address a particular VQA query, thus achieving significant improvements over existing approaches.
