# 1.背景介绍

Gravitation is the fundamental force that connects all matter in the universe. It makes theories of physics like quantum mechanics possible, but gravitational waves (GW), as they are called today, can provide a powerful probe into the nature of gravity itself. They are also a breakthrough for astrophysicists because they reveal how galaxies form and evolve over cosmic time.
In this article we will explore what gravitational waves are, why they are so exciting to scientists and engineers, and how we can use them to solve some of the most challenging problems in our understanding of space and time. We'll start by examining the basics of general relativity, including its physical principles and equations of motion, before moving on to describe GW and cosmology.
2. Core Concepts and Connections:
We begin with an overview of general relativity, which was proposed many years ago as a way to explain gravitational effects and keep pace with advances in technology such as the advent of interferometers. Its basic idea is that the laws of nature act in spacetime that look different from the ones we experience when looking at it through our eyes. This means that objects far away appear smaller than those near us, and light doesn't always travel in straight lines between two points. General relativity provides a basis for describing gravity with gravitational waves.
The first equation of general relativity describes the relationship between gravitation and time dilation due to curvature:
e = 1 / c^2
where e is the relative speed of light and c is the speed of light in vacuum. This means that the uncertainty principle applies: as we get farther from the observer, there's more uncertainty about where we actually are. Another important result of GR is that gravity forms a metric tensor, which allows us to study gravity in three dimensions instead of just two. In six-dimensional Euclidean space-time, the metric tensor takes the following form:
g_{\mu\nu} = \left\{ \begin{array}{lll} -1 & \text{if } \mu=\nu \\
                                   R & \text{if } \mu=1,\nu=2\\
                                   0 & \text{otherwise}\end{array} \right.,
where g_{\mu\nu} gives the contraction between four-vectors corresponding to positions or momenta. For example, if A(t) is a four-vector representing position and P(t) is another four-vector representing momentum, then g_{tt}|A(t)|^2|P(t)|^2 gives us the energy of the system.
With these tools in hand, we're ready to introduce gravitational waves.
3. Gravitational Wave Physics:
Gravitational wave theory predicts that gravitational waves propagate as waves in spacetime rather than particles passing through space like regular electromagnetic waves do. To understand how this works, let's consider a simple case where one object moves with constant velocity v and another object at rest. We can then draw a line connecting their initial positions, which represents the instantaneous path of the source. At each point along this line, there will be a gravitational potential energy pe, which depends on the distance r between the objects and the strength of the attraction between them.
If we assume that the path of the source does not change too much in time (i.e., we have small enough velocities), then we can use calculus of variations to find the wave function psi(x, t; μ) that satisfies both the initial value problem and the boundary value problem for this spatial coordinate x and time t. These equations give us the expression for the electric field and other aspects of the wave based on the values of pe and pr at nearby points. If we know the initial conditions and boundary conditions well enough, we can numerically simulate the wave propagating in time until we reach the detector.
To see the big picture, here's an animation showing the wave propagating in time for a sine-wave packet and a stationary mass. As you can see, the intensity of the wave increases radially outward from the source and decreases again radially toward the detector.

This type of wave pattern occurs naturally in nature whenever two strong fields interact. For example, the electromagnetic waves we perceive every day come from interactions between the magnetic field produced by the Earth's core and the radiation from the sun. Similarly, the GW signal observed today comes from the merger of a black hole and a neutron star. And even though no direct evidence exists yet, hypotheses suggest that the appearance of gravitational waves could revolutionize our understanding of the early universe.
4. The Case for Cosmology and Time Dilation:
One key question for any physicist working with GW signals is whether they arise from violent explosions, or from more subtle processes involving dark energy and primordial magnetar oscillations. Despite the obvious differences in origin, we should expect similar observations of both types of GWs. However, the rate of increase and decrease in amplitude will depend on various factors, including the details of the propagation and detection methods used to observe GW events. Moreover, since GW events don't necessarily occur instantaneously, it's difficult to measure precise times or durations without additional instrumentation. Therefore, we need a model that accounts for the long term evolution of the background cosmology, and includes effects such as inflation, dark energy, and stochastic fluctuations.
Cosmology is the science of large-scale structure and history, and plays a central role in GW research. While traditional approaches in cosmology focus on individual galaxies and their motions, GW experiments search for signals that might trace the scale-dependent properties of the universe as a whole. One approach is to use models that include relativistic corrections to account for the expansion and contraction of the Universe. Another approach involves modeling the dynamics of the graviton, a new particle whose creation is predicted to play a crucial role in the future of particle physics.
Time dilation is one of the primary drivers of GW amplitude increase. Scientists often attribute this effect to the presence of massive stars and supernovae in the foreground. As stars merge together, they create a bipolar system with two distinct components spinning opposite directions. This causes the temperature of the material to fall, causing an exponential increase in the effective mass of the system. Once the bipolar systems become dominant, the resulting structures behave differently under gravitational potentials. Moreover, any deflection caused by the presence of non-flat space can cause GW distortions. Overall, our understanding of the universe needs to move beyond short-term trends and focuses on longer-term cosmological patterns and mechanisms that drive GW signals.
