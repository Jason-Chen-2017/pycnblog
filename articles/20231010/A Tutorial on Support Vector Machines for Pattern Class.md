# 1.背景介绍


Support vector machines (SVMs) are a powerful machine learning method used for both classification and regression analysis tasks in supervised learning. In this article, we will explore SVMs from the perspective of pattern classification and learn about its key concepts and operations. 

The support vector machines algorithm is based on the idea that the decision boundary should be determined by finding the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the two classes. The objective of training an SVM model is to find the optimal values of the weight vectors and bias terms in order to maximize the margins around the hyperplanes as well as the minimum distance between the data points and their corresponding hyperplanes. We can define the hyperplanes based on any combination of input features, which makes SVM particularly useful for high-dimensional datasets with non-linear relationships among variables.

In summary, SVMs provide a powerful technique for solving complex problems in pattern classification and prediction by identifying patterns or trends within datasets while minimizing errors due to overfitting or underfitting. However, it requires careful handling of kernel functions and feature scaling before applying them to large datasets. Therefore, SVM models require expertise in mathematical optimization techniques such as gradient descent and backpropagation algorithms to train effectively.

## Hyperplane
A hyperplane is a flat surface that separates space into two parts where each part corresponds to one of the possible output class labels. It is defined mathematically by $w^T x + b = 0$, where $x$ is the input vector, $w$ is the vector of weights, and $b$ is the bias term. For example, if there are three possible output classes, then three hyperplanes can be drawn parallel to one another. These planes partition the input space into regions corresponding to different combinations of classes. When we consider multiple input variables, the hyperplane may not always exist; however, when we add more dimensions to our dataset, more complicated hyperplanes may emerge.


## Margin
The margin is the gap between the hyperplane and the closest data point in either direction along the normal vector pointing outward. This margin defines the maximum allowable error between the predicted output label and the true output label of a new observation. The width of the margin also indicates how confident the classifier is about making predictions. If the margin is too small, it means that even small changes in the input variables can result in very different outputs. Conversely, if the margin is too large, the classifier may be highly sensitive to individual observations and fail to generalize well to unseen data. Hence, it is crucial to select a suitable margin during training and testing stages.


## Kernel Functions
Kernel functions are a way to transform the original input space into higher dimensional space where linear separation becomes easier. Essentially, a kernel function is a similarity measure between two input vectors that tells us how much they are similar. Common kernel functions include polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid functions. 

Using kernel functions allows us to perform nonlinear classification directly in the original input space without having to create many separate hyperplanes in higher dimensionality. Instead, we can use only one linear hyperplane to classify all the data points simultaneously. There are several advantages of using kernels:

1. Efficiency: Training SVMs using kernel methods often results in faster convergence than traditional approaches because fewer calculations need to be performed. 

2. Flexibility: Kernel functions enable us to capture complex non-linear relationships within the data. They have been proven to work well for a wide range of applications including image recognition, text categorization, bioinformatics, etc.

3. Nonparametric: Unlike traditional parametric models like logistic regression, SVMs do not assume anything about the underlying distribution of the data. This property allows them to handle complex datasets with high dimensionality and flexibility.

## Regularization Techniques
Regularization is a process of adding a penalty term to the cost function of the model to prevent overfitting. Two common regularization techniques in SVMs are L1 and L2 norm regularization.

L1 regularization encourages sparsity in the solution, i.e., it forces some of the coefficients to zero. It works by adding the absolute value of the weights to the cost function, which leads to sparse solutions with few non-zero elements.

On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a quadratic penalty term to the cost function, which promotes smoothness and reduces variance. Mathematically, it adds the square of the magnitude of the weights to the cost function, leading to a smoother decision boundary with less oscillations. Overall, L2 regularization provides better performance compared to L1 regularization in most cases but requires careful parameter selection.
