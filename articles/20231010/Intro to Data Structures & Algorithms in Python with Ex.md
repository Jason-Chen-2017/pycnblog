# 1.背景介绍


Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts for any developer who wants to write efficient code that runs efficiently on different machines or operating systems. In this article, we will be focusing on the basics of data structures and algorithms using Python programming language and provide you with practical examples along with the key points involved.

In this article, we will be discussing various data structures such as Lists, Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables, Trees, Heaps, Graphs, Tries etc., and their operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, searching, sorting, and some important applications of these data structures like finding pairs, shortest path problem, maze solving etc. We will also cover common algorithmic patterns used frequently by developers like Bubble Sort, Quicksort, Merge sort, Binary Search, Depth First Search, Breath First Search, Dijkstra’s Algorithm, A* search, Heap Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Bucket Sort, Radix Sort, Counting Sort etc., and how they can be implemented in Python. 

By the end of this tutorial, you should have a strong understanding of data structures and algorithms, which would help you choose appropriate ones based on your requirements and solve complex problems effectively. You should also gain insights into advanced topics like Big O notation, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Divide and Conquer Approach, Probabilistic Algorithms, Mathematical Proofs, Randomized Algorithms, and Design Patterns.


# 2.Core Concepts and Relationship
Let's start our journey of learning about data structures and algorithms by first introducing several core concepts and relationships among them.

1. Array: An array is an ordered collection of elements of same type stored at contiguous memory locations. It has two primary properties - fixed size and homogeneous (all elements must be of the same type). Arrays offer fast access times but require extra space. 

2. List: A list is another linear collection that supports dynamic resizing and flexible indexing. It has several implementations including arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues. The main difference between lists and arrays is that lists support non-homogeneous data types and allow duplicate entries whereas arrays only allow one type of element per slot. Lists use pointers internally to implement dynamic resizing and make it easier to add or remove elements from middle of the list without shifting the rest of the elements.

3. Queue: A queue is a simple linear structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the rear end and removed from the front end. As the name suggests, this means that the first item inserted into the queue will always be the first item to be removed. Queues are commonly used for processing tasks where order of execution matters. For example, printer jobs are typically printed in the order in which they arrive, even if there are many print jobs waiting to be processed. Similarly, printing jobs are usually placed into a queue until an available printer can accept them.

4. Stack: A stack is another linear collection that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. It operates on the principal of Last-In/First-Out (LIFO), meaning that the last item inserted is the first one to be removed. This makes it useful when implementing undo functions, program call stacks, browser back button functionality etc. Like queues, stacks operate on top of dynamically resizable arrays so adding or removing elements is quick. However, unlike queues, stacks do not guarantee the order in which items are retrieved.

5. Linked List: A linked list is a sequence of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence. Each node may store additional information such as the value of the previous node. Linked lists are used extensively in computer science because they allow easy addition or removal of elements from anywhere within the sequence while preserving its overall shape. They are especially effective for managing large amounts of data that need to be accessed sequentially or randomly, although their slower access time comes at the cost of increased overhead compared to static arrays.

6. Tree: A tree is a nonlinear hierarchical collection of nodes connected by edges. A root node serves as the starting point for building out the hierarchy and other nodes branch off from it. There are three types of trees: binary tree, balanced binary tree, and trie (pronounced try). Binary trees have two child nodes, while tries can have zero or more children. Balanced binary trees have roughly equal number of nodes in the left and right subtrees at every level.

7. Hash Table: A hash table is a data structure used to store and retrieve values quickly given a key. Keys in a hash table are mapped to indexes using a mathematical function called hashing, which produces an index. Depending on the quality of the hashing function, collisions can occur and multiple keys can map to the same index. To handle collisions, separate chaining is often used where each bucket in the table stores a linked list of values that collided at that particular index. Common hashing functions include multiplication, division, addition, XOR, and prime numbers.

8. Set: A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets cannot contain duplicates and maintain no ordering. Instead, sets provide methods for performing union, intersection, difference and symmetric difference operations.

9. Priority Queue: A priority queue is similar to a queue, except that each element has a priority associated with it. When an element is dequeued, it is guaranteed to be the highest priority element present in the queue. Popping the lowest priority element takes longer than popping the highest priority element since all higher priority elements must be shifted downward. Priority queues are used in scheduling algorithms, routing protocols, and real-time simulations.

10. Graph: A graph is a set of vertices connected by edges. Edges connect vertices together, forming a network. Graphs can represent networks of physical objects, social interactions, and processes. Graphs can be directed or undirected depending on whether they have directionality in the connections. Directed graphs model cause and effect relationships, while undirected graphs model symmetrical relationships. Some popular graph algorithms include breadth-first search (BFS) for shortest paths, depth-first search (DFS) for topological sorts, dijkstra’s algorithm for single source shortest paths, and A* search for finding the optimal path through a graph.
