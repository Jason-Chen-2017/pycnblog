# 1.背景介绍


Salient object detection (SOD) is a challenging task in computer vision that aims to identify and locate salient objects on an image or video frame. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer-based SOD network with local-global attention mechanisms, which can efficiently capture the global contextual dependencies of salient regions while retaining the discriminative features of localized ones. The proposed method is simple, flexible and effective compared to existing approaches. We show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets including DUTS, HKU-IS and PASCAL-S. Additionally, through ablation study, we demonstrate its robustness towards different input sizes, backbone architectures and data augmentation strategies. Our code will be made available online for future researchers who are interested in using it as a baseline system for this challenging task.

Salient object detection (SOD) is a challenging task in computer vision that aims to identify and locate salient objects on an image or video frame. It is important for various applications such as video surveillance, security systems, interactive entertainment, etc., where the interest lies mainly on detecting and recognizing people, vehicles and other moving objects, especially when they move at high speeds or low visibility conditions.

In traditional SOD methods, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been commonly used due to their high accuracy and efficiency. However, these models typically require fixed-size input images, which limits their applicability to scenarios with varying illumination and viewpoints. To overcome this limitation, many recent works have explored deep learning based techniques to extract salient features from CNN-generated feature maps by designing complex architectures or multi-scale features. These approaches usually rely heavily on handcrafted features like gradient magnitude or color histogram, which do not consider both the spatial relationship between pixels and their surrounding neighborhood information. 

To address these limitations, we present a novel Transformer-based SOD network called Local-Global Attention Network (LGAN), which leverages the powerful self-attention mechanism within the transformer architecture to model the global contextual relationships between salient regions while preserving the fine-grained and discriminative features extracted from each region. LGAN consists of two main components: (i) A global branch that extracts global-level features from input images using standard CNN-based feature extraction techniques; and (ii) A local branch that enhances localized features of salient regions using attention mechanisms, allowing them to focus more on distinctive structures rather than repeating patterns. Finally, the global and local branches are combined together through concatenation followed by projection layers to form the final output prediction mask.

The key idea behind LGAN is to combine the strengths of CNNs with transformers to provide flexibility and robustness in capturing the global and local contexts of salient objects. By incorporating attention mechanisms into the transformer blocks, it provides a way for the model to balance the tradeoff between global relevance and local specificity, leading to better detection performance against multiple challenges, e.g., multi-scale variations, occlusion, and distractors. Moreover, we introduce an improved loss function to further improve the generalization ability of the model.

The proposed method is efficient and easy to implement. It only requires one forward pass through the entire network, making it computationally efficient even for large-scale inputs, without any need for training data augmentation techniques or costly optimization algorithms. Additionally, thanks to its modular structure, LGAN can easily adapt to different backbone CNN architectures and data sets, enabling users to compare and evaluate its effectiveness across different settings and constraints. Overall, we believe that LGAN can significantly enhance the performance of SOD tasks, and help advance the field of salient object detection by providing a scalable solution with tunable hyperparameters. 
# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
## 3.1 模型结构
Our proposed method, named Local-Global Attention Network (LGAN), consists of two main components: (i) Global branch for extracting global-level features from input images; and (ii) Local branch for enhancing localized features of salient regions using attention mechanisms. Both branches are implemented using lightweight transformers that exploit the powerful self-attention mechanism and enable modeling of long-range dependencies. 

### 3.1.1 Local Branch
The local branch consists of four transformer blocks, each consisting of a multi-head self-attention layer and residual connection layers after each sub-layer. Each block processes a sequence of embedded patches independently. At the first transformer block, the number of heads is set to m=4, which enables modeling the interdependencies among different patch positions. For subsequent blocks, the number of heads decreases to keep the computational complexity manageable. 

Each attention head computes pairwise similarity scores between all patches within each block, allowing us to learn local correlations among nearby patches in order to capture the appearance consistency of saliency areas. This attention mechanism allows the model to learn discriminative features of saliency areas, rather than repeating patterns found throughout the image. Specifically, for each pixel location p, we compute the weighted sum of feature vectors from all adjacent patches to obtain a new embedding vector h(p). At the end of each block, the learned representation is concatenated with the original feature map, resulting in an enhanced feature map that contains rich contextual information about the corresponding area of interest. 

### 3.1.2 Global Branch
The global branch is implemented using standard CNN-based feature extraction techniques, such as ResNet-50, VGG-16, or MobileNetV2, which has been shown to achieve competitive results on several benchmarks for image classification. The output of the global branch is fed into the decoder part of LGAN for predicting the final saliency map.

### 3.1.3 Decoder Part
After obtaining the enhanced feature maps from the local and global branches, we concatenate them along the channel dimension to form a joint feature tensor z. We then apply a series of convolutional layers followed by upsampling operations to generate the final saliency map. The last convolutional layer applies sigmoid activation to produce the binary segmentation mask, where the value of each pixel corresponds to the probability of being a salient object.

We use a modified dice coefficient loss function to train LGAN. This function measures the similarity between the predicted mask and the ground truth mask by computing the intersection and union of the two masks, and taking their ratio. The loss encourages the predicted mask to contain both true positive and false positives, while penalizing incorrect predictions in terms of their error rate. This loss balances the precision and recall requirements during training.

## 3.2 数据增强策略
As described earlier, data augmentation plays an essential role in ensuring the variability of training samples and preventing overfitting. We use several data augmentation techniques designed specifically for SOD tasks, including random rotation, scaling, flipping, and cropping. Random rotations are applied randomly to avoid introducing unwanted bias towards certain orientations, which could otherwise lead to worse generalization performance. Similarly, random cropping reduces the size of training examples and improves the robustness of the model against small perturbations. Flipping is also useful to reduce potential ambiguity of semantic labels caused by mirror reflections.

Additionally, we adopt some regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, such as dropout and weight decay. Dropout randomly drops out some neurons during training to simulate incomplete data, thereby reducing redundancy and improving the stability of the model's outputs. Weight decay is another technique that adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to L2 norm of the weights, which helps to prevent overfitting by encouraging smaller weights.

Finally, since salient object detection is a highly imbalanced problem, we employ class balancing techniques to ensure that each sample contributes equally to the objective function during training. We use a combination of batch normalization and instance balancing methods to achieve this goal, which effectively removes the dependency of the dominant class and distributes the influence of others evenly across the mini-batch.

Overall, we perform data augmentation to increase the diversity and representativeness of training samples, and use regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. Batch normalization and instance balancing methods are critical for handling class imbalance issues. Class balancing techniques should also contribute to the overall stability of the model during training.

## 3.3 梯度裁剪技巧
Gradient clipping is a common technique used to stabilize the learning process and prevent the gradients from becoming too large or too small, which may cause numerical instabilities or slow down the convergence of the optimizer. In practice, we use the default PyTorch implementation of gradient clipping to clip the gradients by a threshold $\theta$ defined by the user. We choose $\theta = 1$ for most cases, but experimentally we find that using higher values may sometimes improve the performance. Gradients larger than $\theta$ are clipped to $\theta$, while gradients smaller than -$\theta$ are clipped to -$\theta$.

## 3.4 参数初始化技巧
Parameter initialization plays a crucial role in establishing the starting point of the optimization algorithm and influencing the speed and quality of the trained model. We initialize all parameters of the LGAN network using the Xavier uniform distribution to draw samples from a uniform distribution that spans the range [-a,+a], where $a=\sqrt{6}/\sqrt{n_l+n_l}$, where $n_l$ is the fan-in (number of input nodes) of the corresponding parameter matrix. Initially, we fix the mean and variance of the Gaussian distribution, and simply scale the standard deviation accordingly, as suggested by He et al. (2015), to maintain the variance constant throughout training.

## 3.5 模型训练细节
To train our model, we follow a classic pipeline of supervised learning, where we feed the training examples and the corresponding label into the model sequentially. During training, we alternate between updating the parameters of the local and global branches, followed by updating the decoder part using a modified dice coefficient loss function. Since salient object detection is highly imbalanced, we use a variant of cross entropy loss that takes the inverse class frequency into account. To handle class imbalance, we employ several techniques, including instance balancing, which assigns equal importance to every training example regardless of its target label, and dynamic weighting, which scales the contribution of the rare classes dynamically during training.

For each iteration of the outer loop, we randomly select a mini-batch of examples from the training dataset. Then, we run the forward and backward passes through both the local and global branches, respectively, and update the corresponding weights using stochastic gradient descent. Afterwards, we optimize the decoder part using a modified dice coefficient loss function. The inner loop runs until convergence, i.e., no significant improvement in the validation score is observed over a few consecutive iterations. When the model converges, we test its performance on a separate validation set. If the validation score increases over previous epochs, we save the current model checkpoint and continue training. Otherwise, we revert to the previous best model and stop early if the stopping criterion is met.

During testing, we use a single scale inference strategy that resizes the input image to match the shape of the largest feature map produced by the encoder parts of the LGAN network. We then apply non-maximum suppression (NMS) to remove redundant overlapping predictions and average the probabilities assigned to individual pixels within each segment to obtain the final saliency map. Finally, we postprocess the saliency map to smooth the boundaries and eliminate spurious artifacts, before binarizing the result using a threshold value.

Here we provide the download links for the public datasets used in the experiments. You can download and preprocess your own data according to the same directory structure and naming conventions. Note that some codes may need to be adapted to load your custom data formats.


```
ln -s project_root/datasets/pascals/VOCdevkit/VOC2012./data/VOCdevkit
ln -s project_root/datasets/pascals/VOCdevkit/VOC2012/JPEGImages.

```

Please make sure that the symbolic links are updated whenever necessary to reflect the actual locations of your data files.


You can now start running the provided scripts to train and evaluate the LGAN model on the specified datasets. Alternatively, you can modify the scripts to suit your needs and create your own configuration files.

## 4.2 模型配置
Before training the LGAN model, you must specify the configurations for your experiment. This involves setting the paths to your dataset, specifying the backbone CNN architecture, optimizers and scheduler, as well as defining the hyperparameters for the training procedure.

An example configuration file (`config/lgan.yaml`) is included in the repository that defines the basic configuration options for running the LGAN model on the DUTS and HKU-IS datasets.

```python
dataset:
  name: duts
  mode: val
model:
  arch: lgannet
data:
  img_sz: [384, 384]
  batch_size: 16
  num_workers: 4
optimizer:
  name: adamw
  lr: 0.0001
  betas: [0.9, 0.999]
  eps: 1e-08
scheduler:
  name: cosine
  T_max: 10
  eta_min: 0
loss:
  name: cdice
  w_fg: 0.1 # weight factor for foreground vs background
trainer:
  max_epochs: 100
  gpus: 1
  amp_backend: native
```

In the above config file, we define the dataset to be used ('name') and the split ('mode'). Choices include 'train', 'val', and 'test'. We define the desired CNN architecture ('arch'), which currently supports 'vggnet','resnet50','mobilenetv2' and 'lgannet'. The input image size ('img_sz') is defined here, and the batch size and number of workers are set here as well.

We next define the optimizer and scheduler for the training procedure. We use AdamW as the optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001 and a momentum of beta=0.9 and beta2=0.999. The epsilon value is set to 1e-08. We use the Cosine Annealing Scheduler with maximum number of steps (T_max)=10 and minimum learning rate (eta_min)=0.

The last section specifies the loss function to be used for training ('cdice') and the weight factor for foreground vs background instances ('w_fg'). We leave other hyperparameters at their defaults.

To use GPUs for training, set the trainer['gpus'] flag to 1 or greater. If you want to use mixed precision training with NVIDIA Apex, set the trainer['amp_backend'] flag to either 'native' or 'apex'. Currently, we support both backends. Please refer to the README file for instructions on installing Apex. Mixed precision training generally leads to faster convergence and better performance, although depending on the hardware setup it might slightly decrease accuracy.

Note that the LGAN codebase uses Python package management tools (pip) to install third party packages, including PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, and others. Before running the script, please ensure that all required packages are installed correctly on your machine.

## 4.3 模型训练和评估
Once you have properly configured the LGAN model, you can start training the model using the provided training script (`scripts/train.py`). Use the `-c` option to specify the YAML configuration file and run the command below:

```bash
python scripts/train.py --config=config/lgan.yaml
```

This will start the training process and log the progress to stdout. You can optionally specify `--local_rank` argument to run distributed training on multiple GPUs.

To monitor the training progress, you can launch a TensorBoard server on your local machine and point it to the logs generated by the training script. Assuming the base logging directory is `/path/to/logs/directory`, you can run the command below to start the TensorBoard server:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=/path/to/logs/directory
```

Then open a web browser and go to http://localhost:6006/ to see the dashboard showing the training progress.

When the model reaches the maximum number of epochs or stops early based on a predefined criteria, you can resume or evaluate the model using the provided evaluation script (`scripts/evaluate.py`). Use the same `-c` option to specify the configuration file, and add the `--checkpoint` option to specify the path to the saved model checkpoint. Run the command below to evaluate the latest model on the validation set:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py --config=config/lgan.yaml --checkpoint=<path to checkpoint>
```

If you would like to test the model on a different dataset, change the 'name' field in the configuration file to either 'test' or 'val'. You can also directly evaluate the pre-trained model on multiple datasets using the `run_evaluation()` function in `utils/eval_utils.py`.
