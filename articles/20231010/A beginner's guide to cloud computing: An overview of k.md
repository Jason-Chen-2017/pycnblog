# 1.背景介绍


The rise of cloud computing has made it easier for developers to build scalable applications that can handle the increasing amount of data generated by users in real-time. However, as with any technology, new terminologies, principles, and algorithms come along with cloud computing and its various services. If you are a beginner who wants to understand how cloud computing works, then you will have to grasp some fundamental concepts and terms that are essential for your success. Here is an overview of these core concepts and terms to help you get started with cloud computing.

# Core Concepts
## What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing refers to the on-demand delivery of computing resources via the internet. It offers flexible, economical, and scalable solutions through the use of platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, etc. These platforms provide infrastructure as a service (IaaS) or platform as a service (PaaS). IaaS provides servers, storage, networks, and other IT resources, while PaaS provides application environments and runtime services.

In simple terms, cloud computing allows businesses to access remote systems like databases, file storage, and messaging services, without having to invest in high-end hardware and software. Instead, they only pay for what they actually use. This makes cloud computing particularly useful when dealing with large volumes of data and complex processing requirements, making it ideal for modern web applications, mobile apps, big data analysis, and analytics.

## Distributed Systems
Distributed computing involves multiple independent computers working together seamlessly to process tasks. Each computer is connected to another over a network and shares information and resources amongst themselves. In distributed systems, there is no single point of failure; if one node fails, the entire system fails. Therefore, distributed systems are more robust than centralized systems and offer better fault tolerance. The architecture of a distributed system includes several types of components including clients, server nodes, gateways, and middleware. Clients send requests to the middleware which handles them, distributing them across different server nodes based on load balancing techniques. Middleware also monitors the health of each node and routes failed messages to alternative nodes. 

There are three main paradigms for designing distributed systems - Shared Data, Shared Resources, and Message Passing. 

1. Shared Data Paradigm
This model assumes that all nodes share a common data store. Processes running on different nodes interact with the shared database directly. Examples include Apache Hadoop, Cassandra, and MongoDB.

2. Shared Resources Paradigm
In this approach, resources are allocated to individual processes instead of nodes. Processes communicate with each other to perform operations. Examples include Apache Spark and OpenMPI.

3. Message Passing Paradigm
In this approach, communication between nodes is done by passing messages. Processes do not directly access each other’s memory but exchange messages through queues or topics. Examples include Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ.

# Key Terms & Concepts

## Virtualization vs Containerization
Virtualization refers to creating a virtual instance of a physical machine, where each virtual instance runs independently from the host operating system. Containers, on the other hand, are lightweight isolated environments that run in user space and are commonly used for microservices architectures. Containers allow you to package code and dependencies into a container image, which can be deployed easily on any container orchestration platform. The following list briefly explains the differences between virtualization and containers:
1. Virtual Machine (VM): A virtual machine emulates a complete physical computer. It operates similarly to a physical computer, including processors, memory, storage devices, and input/output peripherals. VMs typically run full-blown operating systems, providing access to all underlying functionality. They require significant overhead due to the guest OS being duplicated at runtime, consuming additional resources.

2. Docker: Docker is a containerization engine that simplifies the deployment of applications inside containers. Unlike traditional VM technologies, Docker images contain just the necessary parts of an application and packages them into a standard format that can run on any Linux distribution. By separating applications from their execution environment, Docker enables faster development cycles, higher density, and increased portability across clouds and platforms. Docker uses cgroups and namespaces to isolate containers from the underlying operating system, further ensuring security and resource isolation.

3. Hypervisor: A hypervisor is a layer between the guest OS and the physical hardware, responsible for managing the resources available to virtual machines. Most modern hypervisors support virtualization of x86, AMD64, ARM, and POWER instruction sets. They enable virtual machines to span multiple servers, clusters, or datacenters, reducing costs and improving performance. While virtualization enables efficient utilization of shared resources, hypervisors act as gatekeepers to ensure that virtual machines behave correctly and securely within their confines.

4. Container Orchestration: Container orchestrators manage the lifecycle of containers and provide automation for scaling, routing, and management of services across multiple hosts. Popular options include Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Nomad, and ECS. All of these tools work closely with container runtimes like Docker or rkt, allowing you to deploy, scale, and manage your containers effectively.
