# 1.背景介绍


Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning technique that involves an agent interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards and punishments to learn how to take actions that will maximize long-term reward. The central goal behind RL is to develop agents capable of autonomously selecting optimal behaviors for achieving their goals while maximizing their reward over time. Despite its success, however, there have been several challenges associated with RL research. 

The first challenge lies in the lack of efficient exploration techniques that enable agents to explore new states and policies without being trapped by local optima or converging too quickly to suboptimal solutions. This has led to diverse approaches ranging from using function approximation methods such as neural networks to construct policies that are amenable to efficient optimization procedures like gradient descent. Another major issue with model-free reinforcement learning is its high sample complexity requirements, making it challenging even for moderate-sized environments. In this article we aim to provide a systematic overview of current research advances towards addressing these two key issues: improving exploration and stabilizing learning algorithms under model uncertainty.

Exploration refers to the process of exploring uncharted territories where no prior knowledge exists about the expected outcomes. One way to address this problem is to use exploration strategies that leverage available domain information to guide the exploration of unknown regions. However, exploration alone cannot guarantee stable learning, especially when facing model uncertainty. To tackle this challenge, we need to balance exploration and exploitation during training. Exploration can be achieved through various sampling techniques such as random sampling, thompson sampling, ucb, etc., which select action samples based on estimated model uncertainties. On the other hand, exploitation allows the agent to focus on areas where it has already learned to perform well and exploit these skills to optimize performance. A popular approach to achieve balanced exploration and exploitation is Q-learning, which balances the bias introduced by the greedy strategy and random exploration by introducing a tradeoff between exploration and exploitation.

Stabilization refers to the process of ensuring that the agent learns effectively and robustly from a variety of initial conditions. Common ways to improve stability include regularizing the policy network, increasing the number of episodes used for training, initializing weights randomly instead of deterministically, adding noise to input features, and tuning hyperparameters such as discount factor, learning rate, exploration rates, etc. These measures attempt to prevent the agent from entering a state of convergence to suboptimal solutions or getting trapped by local minima caused by poor initialization or sparse rewards. Understanding what causes instability and identifying appropriate remedial measures is essential in order to build intelligent agents.


The central idea of our work is to combine these two principles into one framework - Lagrangian Optimization. We propose a novel algorithm called TRPO that addresses both exploration and exploitation by incorporating a penalty term in the objective function that encourages the agent to stay away from unsafe regions while also encouraging it to remain close to known good regions. By doing so, TRPO ensures that the agent stays within a safe region while exploring more promising regions. Overall, we believe that leveraging Lagrangian Optimization brings together ideas from control theory and statistical physics to create an effective method for balancing exploration and exploitation under model uncertainty in model-free reinforcement learning.


# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
To understand the working mechanism of TRPO, let’s consider a simplified version of the game of Tic-Tac-Toe played by two players - Player X and Player O. Here are the steps involved in TRPO:

1. Initialize policy network parameters $\theta$
2. Generate initial trajectories $D_i = \{(s_t^i, a_t^i,r_{t+1}^i)\}_{t=0}^{T^i}$ by running Policy Gradient updates starting from initial policy parameter values $\theta^i$.
3. Compute advantage estimates $G^{i}(s_t^i,a_t^i)=\sum_{k=0}^{K} \gamma^k r_{t+k+1}^i$, where $K$ denotes the horizon length. 
4. Define constraint function $f(\theta)$ to constrain the change in policy parameters across two adjacent iterations $i$ and $i+1$ as follows:
$$
    f(\theta) = E_{\tau \sim D_i}[KL(q_\phi(s,\cdot)|\pi_\theta(s))]\approx KL[\hat{q}_{\phi^{(i)}}(s,\cdot)||\pi_{\theta^{(i)}}(s)]-\alpha \left[KL[\hat{q}_{\phi^{(i+1)}}(s,\cdot)||\pi_{\theta^{(i+1)}}(s)] - \delta\right]
$$

where $\theta$ represents the current policy parameter values, $\theta^{(i)}$ and $\theta^{(i+1)}$ represent the parameter values at iteration i and i+1 respectively, $D_i$ represents the set of collected trajectory data generated at iteration i, and $kl(\cdot|\cdot)$ denotes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two distributions. 

5. Use proximal policy optimization to minimize the following objective function: 
$$
        J(\theta) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}E_{\tau \sim D_i}[\sum_{t=0}^{T^i-1}(\gamma\lambda)\hat{A}_t^\pi + \mathcal{H}(\pi_\theta)]+\alpha f(\theta)
$$

Here $\lambda$ controls the importance of the entropy term and $\mathcal{H}(\pi_\theta)$ represents the entropy of the current policy. $\hat{A}_t^\pi$ is the estimate of Advantage value at timestep $t$. Note that since $J(\theta)$ depends on all previous policy parameter values up to $i$, updating $\theta$ may result in unexpected behavior if not done carefully. Therefore, we introduce a penalized constraint on the changes in policy parameters across two consecutive iterations, i.e., $\alpha f(\theta)$. Moreover, note that computing $f(\theta)$ requires approximating the distribution of $Q$-values, which takes a large amount of computation. Hence, we approximate it using Importance Sampling, obtaining an approximation error $\delta$. 

# 4.具体代码实例和详细解释说明
To implement TRPO, we first define functions to compute the loss terms required for TRPO. Specifically, we have the surrogate loss function, which computes the mean actor-critic loss per trajectory sampled from $D_i$:

```python
def surrogate_loss(actor, critic, obs, act, ret):
    # Calculate the predicted value for the given observation/action pairs
    pred_val = critic(obs,act)
    
    # Calculate the target value for the given observation/action pairs
    target_val = ret[:,None].expand(-1,pred_val.shape[-1])

    # Calculate the difference between predicted and actual value
    delta = pred_val - target_val
    
    # Calculate the surrogate loss
    loss = torch.mean(torch.min(delta*advantages[:,-1], \
                                  torch.clamp(delta, min=-np.inf, max=0)))
    
    
```

Next, we define the proximal policy optimization step, which performs line search to update the policy parameters $\theta$ until the constraint condition is satisfied:


```python
from scipy.optimize import fmin_l_bfgs_b
import copy

def train():
   ...
    
    def f(x):
        pi_new.load_state_dict(copy.deepcopy(pi.state_dict()))
        alpha = x
        
        # Update the new policy parameters according to TRPO equations
        optimizer_pi.zero_grad()
        obj = compute_objective(pi_new,old_pis[0],old_pis[1:],optimizer_pi,epochs,batch_size) 
        obj += lmbda*(compute_entropy(pi_new)-target_entropy).detach().item()
        (-obj).backward()
        optimizer_pi.step()
        
        return -obj.item()/len(episodes)*num_samples
        
    # Set the initial guess for alpha 
    x0 = [init_alpha]*1  
        
    # Run the minimization loop
    res = fmin_l_bfgs_b(f,x0,maxiter=10)    
    alpha = res[0][0]

    
   ...
```
