# 1.背景介绍



In linear algebra, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is a matrix factorization method that decomposes any real or complex matrix into three matrices: U, Σ, V', where U and V' are unitary matrices, and Σ is diagonal with non-negative entries in descending order of magnitudes. The columns of U and rows of V' represent directions in which the data varies most, while the values on the diagonal form a spectrum. It's used widely for several applications such as principal component analysis (PCA), image compression, clustering, and recommender systems. 

Eigendecomposition is another important matrix factorization technique. It involves finding eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a square matrix. Eigenvectors define new basis vectors to transform the original space into a new one, while the corresponding eigenvalues give their respective scaling factors. They're commonly used in signal processing, spectral analysis, image processing, and machine learning algorithms.

However, it can be challenging to understand how they work intuitively from an abstract point of view. This article will explain both concepts visually using animations, diagrams, and code examples. We'll also discuss some common pitfalls and limitations when dealing with these techniques.  

In summary, this article aims at providing insights about two fundamental matrix factorization methods - SVD and Eigendecomposition - through visual explanations and interactive code examples, hoping to help beginners gain intuition and deepen their understanding. 

# 2.核心概念与联系

Let us start by defining the key terms related to the SVD and Eigendecomposition approaches. 

## Linear Algebra
Linear algebra refers to a branch of mathematics that studies vector spaces and linear transformations between them. It includes topics like vector spaces, bases, dimensions, rank, projection, dot product, inner products, span, linear dependence, and subspaces. In general, linear algebra consists of many operations such as addition, multiplication, transposition, etc., which can be defined precisely and rigorously over the field of real numbers and complex numbers. However, we will only use its basic properties and concepts here, so please refer to standard textbooks if you need more details. 

## Matrix 
A matrix $A$ of size $(m \times n)$ represents a mapping between row vectors $\mathbf{a}_i\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and column vectors $\mathbf{b}_j\in \mathbb{R}^m$, i.e., it maps each row vector to exactly one column vector:

$$ A=\left[
    \begin{array}{cc}
        a_{11}&a_{12}\\
        \vdots& \vdots\\
        a_{m1}&a_{m2}\\
    \end{array}\right] $$
    
where $a_{ij}$ denotes the element in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column of $A$. For example, let $\mathbf{x}$ be a row vector of length $n$, then $Ax$ gives the corresponding column vector of length $m$:

$$\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{bmatrix} = A \cdot \begin{bmatrix} a_1^T \\ a_2^T \\ \vdots \\ a_m^T \end{bmatrix}$$

## Vector Spaces
The set of all possible vectors over a given field forms a vector space. Given a vector space $V$, we can identify four main parts:

1. Bases ($\{ e_1, e_2,..., e_n \}$): A finite set of vectors $\{ e_1, e_2,..., e_n \}$, called "bases", whose pairwise dot products are zero, known as the "standard" basis vectors. 

2. Dimension ($dim(V)$): The number of elements in the vector space.

3. Span ($span(\{ v_1, v_2,..., v_k \})$): The set of all vectors that can be written as linear combinations of the basis vectors. That is, if $\{\mathbf{e}_i\}$ is a basis of $V$ and $c_1v_1+c_2v_2+\cdots +c_kv_k=0$ for some coefficients $c_1,\ldots, c_k$, then $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k$ span $\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k\}$.

4. Subspace ($W \subseteq V$): A subset of a vector space $V$ that contains a whole set of vectors under the same operation. Specifically, $W$ is a subspace of $V$ if $W$ is closed under addition and scalar multiplications. We say that $W$ is generated by $\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k\}$ if there exists a basis $\{\mathbf{e}_i\}$ such that $\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k\}= span(\{ \alpha_i \mathbf{e}_i | \alpha_i \in \mathbb{F} \})$. Here, $\mathbb{F}$ is the field of scalars over which the vector space is defined.

## Null Space
The null space of a matrix $A$ is the set of vectors $\{ \mathbf{x} \mid Ax=0 \}$. If $\mathfrak{N}(A)=\{ \mathbf{x} \mid Ax=0 \}$, then $A^{-1}$ exists and satisfies $\mathfrak{N}(A)\neq \{ 0 \}$. More generally, if $\mathfrak{N}(A)$ is nonempty, then $A$ is said to have full rank. Otherwise, $A$ is said to have rank deficiency.

We can also express the null space of a matrix $A$ as a function of its singular values $\sigma(A)$. If $\mathfrak{N}(A)$ is nonempty, then $A$ has infinite dimensional because $dim(\mathfrak{N}(A)) > dim(R(A))$ and $\dim(R(A))+\dim(\mathfrak{N}(A))<\infty$. Conversely, if $\mathfrak{N}(A)=\{0\}$, then $A$ has full rank since $\dim(R(A))=\dim(C(A))>0$. Therefore, $\mathfrak{N}(A)$ gives a crucial insight into the relationship between the rank, nullity, and invertibility of a matrix. 

## Orthogonal Matrices
Two matrices $U$ and $V$ are said to be orthogonal if $\forall \vec{v}, \vec{w}\in V, \vec{u}U\cdot\vec{v} = (\vec{w}U)^T \cdot \vec{u}= \|\vec{v}-\vec{w}\|^2=0$. The special case of orthonormal matrices is when $U^TU=VV^T=I$, meaning that $U$ and $V$ are both rotations or reflections around a fixed axis in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We can also write an arbitrary matrix as a combination of rotation and scaling, which means that if $U$ and $V$ are orthogonal and $S$ is a diagonal matrix of diagonal entries $\{\sigma_i\}_{i=1}^n$, then

$$A=USV^{\mathrm{T}}$$

for some diagonal matrix $S$ and $SV=\Sigma I$, where $\Sigma=(\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n)^\top$ is the diagonal matrix of singular values of $A$. Note that we can recover $A$ from its SVD by multiplying the first $r$ columns of $U$ times the first $r$ rows of $V^{\mathrm{T}}$ instead of computing $A=U\Sigma V^{T}$.

## Eigendecomposition
Eigendecomposition refers to a process of finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a square matrix. Let $A\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ be a symmetric matrix. Then, the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of $A$ satisfy the following equation:

$$ A\mathbf{x}_i = \lambda_i\mathbf{x}_i,$$

where $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues and $\mathbf{x}_i$ are the eigenvectors. The right hand side of the above equation corresponds to the change of coordinates resulting from an infinitesimal transformation applied to $\mathbf{x}_i$. When such a transformation leads to no change along the direction of $\mathbf{x}_i$, then $\lambda_i$ is said to be an invariant.

For a complex-valued matrix, the eigendecomposition is extended to include the imaginary part of the eigenvalues. We call the modified eigenvalue problem:

$$ A\mathbf{x}_i = \lambda_i (\cos(\theta_i)+\sin(\theta_i) \mathbf{e}_j),$$

where $\theta_i$ is the argument of $\mathbf{x}_i$. For a real matrix, the existence of the solutions and uniqueness may not hold due to numerical instability issues. To avoid these issues, we often restrict ourselves to Hermitian matrices, i.e., those for which $A=A^H$. In practice, we assume that the input matrix is sufficiently well conditioned, i.e., its spectral radius is close enough to unity that numerical errors do not significantly affect our calculations.

As mentioned earlier, the inverse of a matrix $A$ is obtained via its SVD:

$$A^{-1}= V \Sigma^{-1} U^{\mathrm{T}},$$

where $\Sigma$ is the diagonal matrix of singular values, and $U$ and $V$ are orthonormal matrices. By exploiting the fact that $U$ and $V$ are orthogonal, we can rewrite the SVD decomposition as follows:

$$A= U \Sigma V^{\mathrm{T}}.$$

This suggests a connection between SVD and Eigendecomposition. Using the fact that $\Sigma$ is diagonal, we can compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of $A$ directly from the diagonal components of $\Sigma$:

$$A\mathbf{x}_i = \sigma_i\mathbf{u}_i$$

where $\sigma_i$ are the singular values of $A$, and $\mathbf{u}_i$ are the corresponding left singular vectors of $A$. Similarly, we obtain the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the inverse of $A$ from the right singular vectors of $A$ and their conjugate transpose:

$$A^{-1}B=\Sigma^{-1} U^{\mathrm{T}}\Sigma V^{\mathrm{T}} B \implies B=V \Sigma^{-1} U^{\mathrm{T}} B.$$
