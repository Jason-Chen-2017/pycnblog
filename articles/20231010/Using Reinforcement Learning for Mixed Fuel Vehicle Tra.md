# 1.背景介绍


In mixed fuel vehicles (MFVs), the vehicle must choose between multiple fuels based on their relative efficiencies and consumption rates. This means that different types of energy sources are used to satisfy different needs, such as high-intensity torque or low-carbon fuel economy requirements. However, due to these differences in fuel performance, MFVs may have a significant impact on travel time because they often rely heavily on certain types of energy source(s) during travel. Therefore, it is essential to optimize the fuel mix for optimal travel times so that all types of fuel can be efficiently utilized effectively. 

To solve this optimization problem, several approaches have been proposed. One such approach involves developing reinforcement learning algorithms that learn from experience how an MFV should allocate its fuel resources among its various fuel options. Such algorithms can then adaptively select the best combination of fuels based on the current driving conditions, road condition, environmental factors, etc., thereby achieving better overall efficiency compared to traditional methods like heuristic rules and linear programming models.

However, despite the importance of optimizing travel time under varying conditions, existing literature has only focused on single-fuel, fixed-fuel (FFF) MFVs with limited range capabilities. Moreover, most research focuses mainly on open loop control strategies where the RL agent learns to adjust the throttle position and braking pressure of the car based on feedback obtained from sensors. In contrast, realistically MFVs require closed-loop systems that take into account the effect of other actors, including traffic congestion, driver behavior, and the environmental conditions. These challenges call for more sophisticated planning and control techniques that consider interactions between different components and environments within an MFV. 

In this paper, we present a novel framework called MFV-RL that incorporates model predictive control (MPC) with reinforcement learning (RL). The MPC component takes into account not only the predicted future state of the system but also possible dynamic effects such as traffic and driver behaviors by solving path planning problems using control laws based on deep neural networks. Similarly, the RL component uses value functions and policy gradients to learn to balance exploration vs exploitation tradeoffs during training, thereby ensuring robust operation under uncertain and changing conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology on both synthetic and real data sets for optimal travel time allocation across four main fuels: gasoline, diesel, hydrogen, and battery electricity. Our results show that MFV-RL outperforms a variety of baselines including FFV methods and DPCM solutions while considering the complexities of multifuel transportation. Moreover, the use of closed-loop control enables us to achieve better decision-making and safe operations through adaptive management of fuel consumption, reduced accident risk, and enhanced safety levels.

We will begin by introducing some key concepts related to multi-fueled vehicle travel time optimization and review previous works in this area. We will then describe the MFV-RL algorithm and discuss its key features and contributions. Finally, we will compare MFV-RL against other established baseline models and evaluate its benefits in terms of accuracy and scalability. Overall, the following sections are organized as follows:

2.1 Key Concepts and Related Work
The first section introduces some core concepts related to multi-fueled vehicle travel time optimization and discusses relevant literature. It begins by defining what is meant by multi-fueled transportation, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages associated with each type of transportation mode, and summarizes recent work on shared mobility technologies. Subsequently, we explore the concept of mixed-initiative transportation and identify critical issues in implementing mixed-initiative systems. Next, we summarize research on automated transportation pricing, which attempts to estimate the cost-effective taxi booking strategy given user preferences, destination demands, and service quality levels. Then, we survey the literature on adaptive cruise control, which seeks to minimize idle time by switching modes dynamically based on system dynamics. We next focus on mixed-initiative cruise control, which considers the interaction between the driver's intentions and emergency situations to decide whether to switch modes. We finish with a brief summary of open-loop vs. closed-loop control systems, which differ in their ability to leverage feedback signals from the environment and actuate interactively versus making decisions after observing inputs.


2.2 Multi-Fuel Vehicles (MFVs)
In MFV transportation, the vehicle chooses among multiple fuels depending on their respective efficiencies and consumption rates. For example, in a hybrid gasoline/diesel MFV, the vehicle may choose to drive with either a higher percentage of gasoline or a lower percentage of diesel depending on the level of need. In contrast to conventional, single-fuel (SFV) vehicles, MFVs offer many unique features such as increased mobility range, flexibility, and resilience to adverse weather events. 

2.3 Optimizing Travel Time in MFVs
When designing a system for optimizing travel time under varying conditions, there are typically three steps involved: setting objective function, selecting optimization variables, and formulating constraints. We now examine two primary objectives for optimizing travel time in MFVs, namely minimizing fuel usage and maximizing comfort. Minimizing fuel usage involves allocating fuel resources among available fuels proportionately to their proportions in order to reduce fuel consumption over time. Maximizing comfort involves balancing the amount of driving time spent on reaching a target destination with the physical exertion required throughout the trip. Each of these objectives requires specific modeling approaches based on assumptions about the nature of the fuels, the driving profile, and operational restrictions. 


2.4 Dynamic Models of Driving Behavior in MFVs
One important aspect of MFV travel time optimization is to understand the role of drivers' intentions and physiological characteristics when making decisions about fuel selection and allocation. To address this challenge, we need to develop a comprehensive understanding of drivers' psychological and physiological states, behaviors, and perceptions during their trip. We use dynamic models of human driving behavior and apply them to MFV simulations to study how drivers make choices and how these choices affect the subsequent trajectory of the vehicle. Specifically, we simulate drivers' intention to follow a planned route, infer their purposeful actions to reach their goal, and capture their mental processes and motor impulses. By integrating insights gained from simulated drivers, we can better inform MFV design and optimization strategies.


2.5 Control Systems for Real-Time Operations
As MFVs operate in real-time environments, efficient control mechanisms are necessary to maintain safe, responsive performance. As discussed earlier, MFVs involve interacting components such as sensors, communication links, controls units, actuators, and infrastructure. While prior work has primarily focused on developing reactive controllers for closed loops, increasing attention towards developing proactive control strategies for real-time applications is crucial. We propose a general framework for applying reinforcement learning (RL) to cooperative intelligent vehicle (CIV) control, combining ideas from MPC, model predictive control, and Q-learning. We utilize deep neural network-based lane change models and task allocation policies to enable continuous lane changes even at high speeds, improve the responsiveness of the CIV to perturbations, and manage unforeseen traffic events. 


2.6 Model Predictive Control for Dynamic Systems
Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have shown promise in solving complex control tasks such as robotics, finance, and autonomous driving. Despite their success, however, they still face significant challenges in complex real-world domains due to the presence of nonlinearities and non-convexities. In particular, they are known to be highly sensitive to initial conditions, variations in the underlying physics, and noise. To address this issue, we propose a new technique called model predictive control (MPC) that combines optimization and simulation to construct smooth trajectories for the controlled system subject to uncertainty and delays. MPC computes candidate solutions to the system's equations of motion using finite differences and employs feedback control laws to generate outputs that approximate the desired trajectories. We extend this idea to analyze the effects of delay and uncertainty on the output trajectories of complex, real-world systems and deploy our solution in a scenario involving CIV control.




2.7 Conclusion
This article provides a detailed overview of the major concepts and principles behind multi-fueled vehicle travel time optimization, along with a description of the MFV-RL algorithm and its key features. We illustrate how the algorithm compares favorably with existing models and shows its potential utility in improving travel times in MFVs while satisfying different design constraints. We close by comparing MFV-RL with other established models and evaluating its effectiveness in terms of accuracy and scalability.
