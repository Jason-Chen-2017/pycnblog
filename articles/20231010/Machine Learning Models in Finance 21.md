## Introduction and History of Financial Analytics
In recent years, finance has witnessed a booming interest in the field of data analytics due to its enormous importance for all sectors of economic life, including banking, insurance, risk management, investment management, and trading. Data analysis plays an essential role in providing valuable insights that can be used to optimize business operations and investments. The need for accurate and efficient financial models is increasing day by day as new information becomes available on markets, customer behavior, and other macroeconomic factors. 

However, traditional statistical methods such as regression analysis, decision trees, and clustering are limited when it comes to modeling complex financial processes with high-dimensional datasets. Deep learning techniques have emerged as a promising solution to this problem because they offer powerful features like automatic feature extraction, ability to learn from large volumes of data, and scalability to handle large-scale data sets. In fact, deep neural networks (DNNs) have become the dominant approach in financial applications, particularly for predictive modeling tasks such as time series forecasting, price prediction, and anomaly detection. They are able to model highly non-linear relationships between input variables and produce reliable predictions despite the presence of noisy or missing data points.

Recent advancements in machine learning technology have led to significant improvements in accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability of DNNs in various financial domains, such as credit rating, stock market analysis, fraud detection, portfolio management, and options trading. This includes using more advanced algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to process time-series data and extract meaningful patterns from them. These models can help make better-informed decisions about various financial risks and opportunities and guide investor portfolios accordingly.

The existing literature related to machine learning in finance mainly focuses on the technical side of applying these models in different financial scenarios, while little attention has been paid to developing effective marketing strategies based on the results obtained. There has also been relatively less research into understanding why certain models work well in specific situations and how they can be further improved. However, there has been a considerable amount of progress towards building comprehensive frameworks for analyzing and optimizing financial markets through the use of AI technologies. For instance, Alpha Architect, a platform designed specifically for quantitative trading, integrates several state-of-the-art AI algorithms for fundamental analysis, fundamental value estimation, sentiment analysis, and portfolio optimization. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop expertise in both theoretical foundations of financial analytics and practical implementation of data-driven solutions using modern machine learning tools.

To address these needs, we propose the following article, which provides an overview of major machine learning models applied in finance today along with their key characteristics and potential uses. We hope this will serve as a useful reference tool for budding data scientists interested in applying these models to solve real-world problems in finance. Furthermore, our focus on explaining the underlying principles behind each model may inspire future researchers to devise novel approaches for improving performance and usability. Finally, since the majority of these models rely heavily on numerical computation, access to appropriate hardware resources may be crucial in achieving good performance. As such, we strongly recommend readers to consult relevant materials on cloud computing platforms, GPU clusters, and programming languages to maximize their effectiveness.

# 2. Core Concepts and Relationships
Before diving straight into the details of each of the core machine learning models mentioned in finance, it's important to understand some fundamental concepts and the relationships among them. Here are some commonly encountered terms:

1. Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning:
Supervised learning involves training a model by feeding it labeled examples; where each example consists of an input vector x and output y. On the other hand, unsupervised learning does not require labeled outputs, just inputs. It learns patterns in the dataset without any prior knowledge of what those patterns should look like.

2. Regression vs Classification:
Regression attempts to model continuous outcomes; i.e., outcomes that can take any real number values. In contrast, classification attempts to model discrete outcomes; i.e., outcomes that belong to one of a set of predefined classes.

3. Probabilistic vs Deterministic Models:
Probabilistic models assume that the outcome of an event can only be determined with some degree of uncertainty. A common approach to deal with this uncertainty is to use probability distributions instead of point estimates. In contrast, deterministic models provide point-estimates that represent the most likely outcome given a fixed set of inputs.

4. Linear vs Non-Linear Models:
Linear models involve linear relationships between input variables and the target variable. This means that if two variables are added together, the result remains a line. While nonlinear models do not necessarily follow this pattern. Instead, they typically capture non-linear interactions between variables, making them more suitable for capturing complex relationships within and across data sets.

5. Reinforcement Learning vs Optimization:
Reinforcement learning requires feedback to adapt its strategy over time, whereas optimization algorithms directly minimize a loss function without requiring human intervention. Additionally, reinforcement learning tends to be more suited for sequential decision-making problems, while optimization algorithms are more frequently used in practice. 

6. Ensemble Methods:
Ensemble methods combine multiple models to improve overall performance. Traditional ensemble methods include bagging, boosting, and stacking. Bagging combines the predictions of multiple models by aggregating their individual errors, while boosting adds additional models that focus on samples that were misclassified by previous ones. Stacking applies a meta-model that trains a separate model on top of the predictions of base models.

7. Regularization Techniques:
Regularization is a technique that helps prevent overfitting, by adding a penalty term to the cost function that discourages the model from being too complex. Commonly used regularizers include L1/L2 norms, dropout layers, and early stopping techniques.

Based on these definitions, here's a breakdown of the relationship between supervised, unsupervised, linear, non-linear, probabilistic, and deterministic models:
