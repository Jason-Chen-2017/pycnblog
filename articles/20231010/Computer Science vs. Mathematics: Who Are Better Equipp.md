# 1.背景介绍


Computer Science and Mathematics have always been closely linked in history as they both come from math and science fields respectively. They share a common objective of understanding reality, which is to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler parts or solving equations. The primary goal is to find patterns within data that can help us understand and make predictions about future outcomes. 

However, despite their similarities, there are also fundamental differences between these two disciplines. Mathematicians use rigorous proofs and formulas to prove properties such as prime numbers and geometric series while computer scientists rely on logic and problem-solving skills to develop algorithms, programs and software systems. In addition, mathematicians tend to be more interested in analytic concepts like calculus while computer scientists often focus on practical applications and real-world challenges.

In this article we will explore some of the core concepts and ideas behind computer science compared with mathematics. We will then dive deep into the mathematical foundations and techniques used by mathematicians that enable them to create models that capture patterns in data effectively. Finally, we will discuss how computer scientists approach different problems differently and identify areas where one field may need a deeper knowledge than another to succeed. Overall, our exploration will provide insight into the role each field plays in today's technical landscape and allow developers to better prepare themselves for the challenges ahead.

# 2. Core Concepts & Ideas
## Numbers and Algebra 
One of the most basic but important principles in mathematics is the notion of order. In number theory, it refers to the relation among integers and rational numbers. On the other hand, algebra deals with operations involving symbolic expressions such as polynomials and power series. These two topics together underpin much of the work performed by mathematicians, especially those who study arithmetic and analysis.  

### Number Theory 
The field of number theory has a long history stretching back over several centuries. It began when Euclid proposed a method for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers called "division algorithm". Since then, numerous approaches have been developed to calculate GCD efficiently using various methods, including binary search, trial division, and Euclidean algorithms. Other crucial tasks include factorization, generating all primes up to a given limit, and computing various forms of discrete logarithms.  
  
Number theoretic algorithms play a significant role in cryptography, elliptic curve cryptography, digital signatures, and public key encryption. Additionally, many security protocols depend on efficient computations of modular exponentiation.

### Algebraic Geometry 
Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics dedicated to describing shapes and spaces through mathematical objects such as points, lines, planes, etc. It employs advanced techniques such as calculus, linear algebra, and abstract algebra to describe and manipulate complex structures. There are several main subfields of algebraic geometry, including differential geometry, topological geometry, fractal geometry, and convex geometry. 

Some popular applications of algebraic geometry include collision detection, robotics, image processing, pattern recognition, and statistical modeling.

### Combinatorics 
Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics devoted to counting, grouping, permutating, and selecting objects. The topic includes many classic problems such as pigeonhole principle, birthday paradox, graph theory, and integer partitions. The combinatorial explosion created by increasingly large amounts of input data requires new computational tools and techniques to handle it.

Some examples of combinatorial problems include generating all possible strings of length n, finding all k-sized subsets of a set S, partitioning a multiset into k parts, and finding all the arrangements of n cards without replacement.

## Algorithms and Data Structures
Algorithms and data structures are essential components of programming and are at the heart of modern computing. Understanding the fundamentals of algorithms and data structures enables programmers to write efficient code that works correctly even with large inputs. Broadly speaking, algorithms are step-by-step procedures that take in input data and produce output according to certain rules. Data structures represent information in a way that makes it easy to access, modify, and manage.

Algorithmic complexity analysis involves determining the time and space required by an algorithm to execute for a particular size of input. This helps to ensure that the algorithm does not become too slow or run out of memory due to its input size. By following best practices in algorithm design, optimization, and implementation, developers can create high-performance solutions that scale well beyond the limits of current hardware.

Data structures typically consist of arrays, lists, stacks, queues, heaps, trees, graphs, sets, and maps. Each type offers specific performance characteristics and benefits depending on the application requirements. For example, hash tables provide constant-time lookup, insertion, and deletion whereas priority queues offer fast retrieval of the highest-priority element(s). Graph algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm are commonly used for routing and scheduling applications.
