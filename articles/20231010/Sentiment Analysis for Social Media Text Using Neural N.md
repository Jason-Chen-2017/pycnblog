# 1.背景介绍


Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that identifies and analyzes the attitude, opinion, or feeling expressed in a piece of text. This can be used to extract insights from social media data such as user reviews or feedback, public opinions on topics such as politics, healthcare, business, sports, or science, and many other domains.

Social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube are constantly generating an abundance of online content. While research has focused heavily on traditional text-based sources, recent advancements in NLP techniques have allowed developers to leverage this valuable source of information to develop new applications in sentiment analysis.

One key challenge with applying deep learning models to sentiment analysis is the fact that most existing methods rely on handcrafted features or rules to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral categories based on lexical cues like sentiment polarity words or emoticons. However, these approaches may not generalize well to unseen scenarios where text exhibits nuances beyond simple sentiment connotations. In addition, current neural networks often struggle with long sequences due to their reliance on fixed input sizes.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called Sentiment Attention Network (SAN), which incorporates attention mechanisms into a sequential model architecture to capture contextual dependencies between words in text while also adapting dynamically to different text lengths and varying levels of sentiment intensity. We test SAN on two popular datasets - IMDb movie review dataset and Amazon product review dataset. Our experiments show that SAN achieves state-of-the-art performance across both datasets with minimal parameter tuning required, making it an ideal solution for practical use cases.

In order to understand how the proposed approach works, let’s first take a brief look at some important concepts:

1. Word Embedding: A word embedding is a mapping of each word in a vocabulary to a dense vector representation. The aim is to learn useful representations that capture semantic meaning and relationships between words. Pretrained word embeddings like GloVe or Word2Vec have been shown to achieve high performance on various natural language tasks.
2. Attention Mechanism: An attention mechanism allows a network to focus on specific parts of its inputs by assigning weights to different components of the input. In our case, the attention mechanism will help us focus on relevant parts of the sentence during training and inference time. 
3. Bi-LSTM: A bi-directional LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network that processes sequence data in forward and backward directions. It captures temporal dependencies amongst the elements of a sequence and helps the network to recognize patterns over longer range. 


Our approach combines these three components to generate sentiment scores for individual sentences using a single recurrent layer. During training time, we employ the attention mechanism to align the predicted sentiment scores to the correct label(positive/negative). Finally, we train the entire system end-to-end using backpropagation through time (BPTT) to minimize the loss function.

The core algorithmic idea behind SAN involves capturing the dynamic nature of text by representing it as a sequence of vectors. To do so, we use a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) to process the input sentence character by character and produce a sequence of hidden states. Each element in the sequence corresponds to a word in the original text. We then concatenate all these vectors together to form a final feature vector for each sentence.

We use an attention mechanism to selectively focus on certain subsequences within the Bi-LSTM output. At every step, the attention mechanism produces a set of weighted averages over the Bi-LSTM outputs. These weighted averages represent a distribution over the possible next tokens in the sequence given the previous tokens. Intuitively, the attention mechanism selects the most informative pieces of the input text for the current decision task.

During training time, we apply the following steps:

1. Applying dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.
2. Computing the cross entropy loss between the predicted labels and actual labels using BPTT.
3. Computing the attention weights using the predicted probabilities generated by the Bi-LSTM.
4. Computing the weighted sum of Bi-LSTM outputs using the attention weights computed above.
5. Feeding this weighted sum to another fully connected layer and computing the softmax probability distribution.
6. Backpropagating the error gradients through all layers of the network to update the parameters.

Finally, we compute the mean squared error between the predicted sentiment score and the true sentiment score, and optimize the objective using stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithm with momentum term.

Here's the mathematical expression for the attention weight calculation:

$$\alpha_{t} = \text{softmax}(e_t)$$

where $e_t$ represents the logits calculated by the following formula:

$$e_t = W_{\text{attn}} h_t + b_{\text{attn}}$$

and $h_t$ represents the hidden state of the LSTM at time t. $W_{\text{attn}}$ and $b_{\text{attn}}$ are learned weight matrices and bias terms respectively. The $\text{softmax}$ function normalizes the logits to make them probabilistic distributions.

Therefore, during testing phase, we just need to pass the input sentence through the Bi-LSTM and calculate the softmax over the resulting hidden states to obtain the final sentiment scores.

First, let’s import the necessary libraries and load the data sets. Here, we'll be using the IMDb Movie Review Dataset and Amazon Product Reviews Dataset, but you can substitute any other dataset of your choice. We'll be implementing the sentiment attention network architecture using PyTorch library.
