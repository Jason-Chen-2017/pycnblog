# 1.背景介绍


Probabilistic robotics is a subfield of artificial intelligence and computer science that focuses on developing algorithms to control autonomous agents or mobile robots with uncertain knowledge and stochastic behaviors [1]. It has been applied successfully to numerous applications such as industrial robotics, driverless cars, teleoperation, medical assistance, and virtual reality [2-4]. However, there are still many challenges yet to be solved for probabilistic robotics, including: limited performance due to uncertainty; systematic failures caused by noise; decision making based on incomplete information; and unintended consequences in the real world [5-7]. 

One of these challenges is about how to handle human social judgments when making decisions under uncertainty. A key problem in this regard is justice: what should an agent do if it receives inconsistent social judgments from multiple sources? In general, people have different expectations of fairness between different actors, contexts, and actions, depending on their personal values, preferences, goals, and ethical beliefs [8], and they may disagree over their perceptions and choices [9] – which can make conflict resolution difficult. For example, it could be argued that one actor deserves a better outcome than another because he/she upholds a certain moral code or normative guideline [10]. To address this issue, we need to develop principles that regulate the behavior of probabilistic robots and ensure justice in all situations. This paper presents a theoretical framework called “A Theory of Justice in Probabilistic Robotics” (ATJPR), which offers a unified approach to assessing and resolving conflicts among multiple actors during decision-making processes based on probabilities and uncertainty quantification techniques [11]. The ATJPR provides a set of axioms and principles that explain why some outcomes are more acceptable than others and establishes criteria for evaluating the fairness of action choice across individuals, organizations, and societies. By incorporating this theory into probabilistic robotic systems, we can achieve more reliable decision-making and reduce conflicts between conflicting parties while improving overall agent performance.

## 2.1 Background
Probabilistic robotics is defined as follows: "probabilistic robotics is a subfield of artificial intelligence and computer science that focuses on developing algorithms to control autonomous agents or mobile robots with uncertain knowledge and stochastic behaviors." Accordingly, the first step is to establish the fundamental concepts related to probabilistic robotics: 

1. Probability distribution function (PDF): When modeling uncertain systems, probability distributions play an essential role in describing the possible states and likelihood of occurrence of each state. A PDF describes the relative likelihood of observing various observations given different underlying states [12].

2. Bayesian reasoning: Within the context of probabilistic robotics, bayesian inference is the process of updating our prior beliefs using new evidence, taking into account both our current understanding and previously made predictions [13]. Bayes' rule is used extensively throughout probabilistic robotics to update posterior beliefs after observing sensor data and actuator commands [14].

Beyond these basic concepts, ATJPR also considers additional core concepts, including:

1. Social conventions: Human social cues often influence the way we behave and make decisions [15]. Therefore, model predictive control (MPC) strategies have been widely adopted to take advantage of known social conventions [16] and optimize decision-making in real-time settings [17].

2. Interactions: In addition to direct physical interactions between humans and robots, humans can indirectly interact with them through shared experiences, communication channels, and culture [18]. Thus, cognitive architectures that consider human interaction within the context of probabilistic robotics will provide greater robustness and adaptability to various environmental conditions [19].

Furthermore, ATJPR relies heavily on mathematical foundations for computing and statistical analysis, including continuous random variables, statistical hypothesis testing, and optimization algorithms [20]. These tools form the basis of several decision-making methods, including monte carlo sampling, reinforcement learning, dynamic programming, and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods [21].

To summarize, ATJPR aims to identify and understand the factors affecting the behavior of probabilistic robots, and then use those insights to design mechanisms that enhance safety, reliability, and effectiveness in decision-making tasks. This involves combining at least three primary components: social convention, MPC strategy, and mathematical models of uncertainty and justice. Overall, ATJPR is a theoretical framework that integrates ideas from psychology, game theory, economics, statistics, and mathematics to create novel solutions to real-world problems in probabilistic robotics.

## 2.2 Axioms & Principles
The AXIOMS and PRINCIPLES of ATJPR outline the criteria that govern the behavior of probabilistic robots, encompassing four main areas: Interaction Design, Policy Development, Fairness, and Trustworthiness. Each area consists of a collection of hypotheses and principles that define acceptable, unacceptable, or desirable outcomes according to specific criteria. Here's a brief overview of the AXIOMS and PRINCIPLES of ATJPR:

1. Psychological Transparency: Probabilistic robots must be transparent and explainable to humans so that they can trust and understand their decision making process [22]. They should offer sufficient information and feedback to enable them to adjust their behavior in response to unexpected events [23].

2. Optimal Stopping Rule: Robots should always stop when they become uncertain or unable to accomplish their mission objective [24]. This principle ensures that the most effective solution is chosen and reduces risk [25].

3. Act Tutor Feedback Loop: Humans should receive instantaneous feedback about their actions and motivations, regardless of their level of expertise [26]. They should learn from mistakes and correct course accordingly, even when no mistake was made intentionally [27].

4. Shared Context: Humans and other agents should share a common understanding of the world around them [28]. They should contribute to building a shared view of the world that is consistent with their own interests and intentions [29].

These principles are designed to prevent conflicts and improve the quality of decision-making in probabilistic robotics, specifically in the presence of multiple stakeholders who may have different goals, preferences, and ethical beliefs. If any of these principles fail, the resulting conflicts cannot be resolved effectively. Therefore, ATJPR provides clear guidelines for designing and implementing policies that satisfy these principles and maximize the utility, efficiency, and safety of probabilistic robots in real-world environments.
