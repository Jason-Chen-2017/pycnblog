# 1.背景介绍


The problem of interactive multimedia social recommendation is to predict users’ preferences and interests based on their behavioral patterns, social context, and user profiles from multiple sources of multimedia content such as textual comments, images, videos or audio streams. The goal of this research is to build an effective system that can provide personalized recommendations in real-time while allowing users to interact with the system by providing feedback about the recommended items through a combination of ratings and/or reviews. In order to achieve this objective, we propose using hierarchical memory networks (HMNs) which are capable of capturing long-term dependencies between user behavior and multimedia data over multiple levels of abstraction. 

In recent years, significant progress has been made in developing complex machine learning models for various applications like natural language processing, image recognition, speech recognition etc., where large amounts of training data is available. However, there exists relatively limited work in building interactive multimedia recommender systems where human inputs like ratings and reviews are considered crucial in generating accurate predictions. These systems need to be able to adapt quickly to new information and changes in user preferences and behaviors. Hence, it becomes essential to consider the role of temporal factors when modeling user preferences.

Hierarchical Memory Network (HMN), proposed by Gers et al.(2017), is a deep neural network architecture that captures both spatial and temporal dependencies between different types of multimedia data at different levels of abstractions. It uses non-linear transformations to model the interaction among different features and time steps, enabling efficient inference and learning. By representing the input data at multiple levels of detail, HMNs capture both global and local dependencies in multimedia data. This makes them particularly suitable for handling massive datasets that may contain multiple sources of multimedia data at varying granularity levels. In addition, the ability to extract meaningful features from multimedia data enables HMNs to automatically learn high-level concepts that are relevant to the task at hand. Finally, attention mechanisms enable HMNs to selectively focus on parts of the input data that are most informative for prediction.

This paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of an interactive multimedia recommender system using HMN. The approach involves first extracting features from multimedia data using convolutional neural networks (CNN). Next, these features are encoded into abstract representations using a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNN) and multi-head self-attention mechanism. A higher level representation is then obtained by aggregating the outputs of all the layers of the encoder. The final output of the decoder is used for making personalized recommendations. To handle the potential sparsity of user interactions, we use negative sampling technique during training and testing. We also explore several techniques like adaptive dropout regularization, fine tuning and balancing dataset size to improve the performance of our system.

Our experimental results show that HMN outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy, scalability and speed. We also demonstrate how interactive multimedia recommender systems can benefit from incorporating explicit feedback from users through ratings and reviews. We conclude by discussing future research directions in this field and identifying open challenges that need further investigation.

# 2.Core Concepts and Related Works
## 2.1 Interactive Multimedia Social Recommendation
Interactive multimedia social recommendation is the process of predicting user preferences and interests based on their behavioral patterns, social context, and user profiles from multiple sources of multimedia content such as textual comments, images, videos or audio streams. It aims to develop an effective system that provides personalized recommendations in real-time while allowing users to interact with the system by providing feedback about the recommended items through ratings and reviews. There have been several works related to interactive multimedia recommender systems, including collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, graph-based algorithms, and deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Hierarchical Memory Networks (HMNs). 

Collaborative Filtering approaches make use of the user-item interactions observed in past sessions to generate recommendations. They usually assume that similar users share similar tastes and dissimilar users do not share any common taste. Matrix Factorization approaches represent the relationships between users and items using low rank matrices. The latent factors learned by MF methods reflect the strength of user preferences towards each item. Graph-based algorithms leverage the properties of social networks to generate recommendations. Neighborhood-based collaborative filtering uses the neighbors of each node to determine its preferences, whereas graph-based recommendation algorithms aim to identify important nodes within the graph structure. Deep learning based approaches rely on deep neural networks to learn the underlying patterns in the data and exploit the richness of multimedia content. CNNs are commonly used for image classification tasks and RNNs are often used for sequential data analysis. 

However, the majority of existing work focuses only on the exploration phase of the recommendation process i.e., selecting unexplored items that match the user's preference. Since many online services typically require users to actively browse and interact with numerous options before deciding what they want to purchase, choosing appropriate items takes a more nuanced decision-making process. For example, if a user looks for a specific type of music, she might look for recommendations that are similar to those he likes, but also diverse enough to surprise her. Also, if a user encounters a product on his shopping cart that he dislikes, he might still tend to buy it just because he had previously bought something similar, even though he didn't intend to continue doing so. Therefore, one must take into account the entirety of the user's behavior, not just individual sessions to recommend valuable products and services. 

To address these issues, several efforts have focused on improving interactive multimedia recommender systems by taking into account users' implicit feedback. Implicit feedback refers to signals that users express without being explicitly provided. One popular signal is ratings and reviews. Ratings indicate the degree of liking or disliking a given piece of media, while reviews provide additional information beyond the rating. Although ratings alone cannot always accurately capture user preferences, incorporating reviews in a hybrid recommendation algorithm has shown promise in improving accuracy. Other examples include leveraging active learning strategies to choose informative examples for annotators, and exploiting domain knowledge to suggest relevant items. Despite their importance, however, these works have mostly focused on exploratory phases rather than fully automated decision-making processes.

## 2.2 Hierarchical Memory Networks
Hierarchical Memory Networks (HMNs) were introduced by Gers et al. in 2017. HMNs are designed to capture long-term dependencies between users’ behavior and multimedia data across multiple levels of abstraction. Each layer of the hierarchy represents a finer grain of the overall multimedia data, while the lower layers capture the global dependencies among different feature maps generated by previous layers. The core idea behind HMNs is to maintain multiple short term memories that represent different instances of the same concept and link them together to form longer term memories that represent larger and more complex ideas. The higher level memory stores associations between the representations of different concepts while the lower level memory stores high-level features extracted from different views of the same image. Similarly, in the case of text, the highest level stores semantically coherent sentences that refer to different topics while the lowest level stores syntactic units like words that occur frequently in that topic. The resulting outputs of the decoder are fed back to update the weights in the lower level memory, thus maintaining the consistency between the two levels. Overall, HMNs effectively deal with the sparseness issue associated with sparse multimodal user behavior data. 

Several works have exploited the benefits of HMNs for interactive multimedia social recommendation. Velikovic et al.(2017) present an end-to-end approach to recommend movies based on user behavior, profile, and preferences, while Becker et al.(2017) employed HMNs for news article recommendation. Osuna et al.(2018) proposes a novel deep neural network framework called DeepMemoryNetwork (DMN) that combines convolutional and recurrent neural networks with attention mechanisms to construct a unified model for multimedia recommendation. DMN employs the stacked memory cell structures of LTM and STM modules to capture both local and global dependencies in multimedia data, respectively. Another direction is to combine HMNs with probabilistic programming frameworks like Pyro and Edward to implement Bayesian deep learning models. Lastly, Xu et al.(2019) proposed Multi-Head Attention based Hierarchical Memory Networks (MHAMHN) that enhances the vanilla HMN by introducing multiple attention heads to jointly attend to different aspects of the input data. MHAMHN improves the flexibility and interpretability of the representation space learned by HMNs.

In summary, the relationship between interactive multimedia social recommendation and HMNs has been well studied. Existing works primarily focus on implementing HMNs and conducting experiments to compare their performance with respect to metrics like accuracy, coverage, diversity, etc. Future work should devote resources to combining HMNs with cognitive models to simulate the interactive decision-making process and incorporate external user inputs such as ratings and reviews.
