# 2.核心概念与联系

Before diving deep into the details of cybersecurity technologies, let’s first define some key terms that are commonly used within the field:

1. Network Security: It involves securing network communications across multiple physical locations, including routers, switches, servers, and user equipment. In simple words, network security aims to ensure communication between different computers and devices, which could come under attack by malicious users or intruders.
2. Endpoint Protection: It refers to software installed on a device, typically a laptop or desktop, that helps prevent malware and viruses from infecting the system. 
3. Intrusion Detection System(IDS): A hardware or software component that analyzes network traffic to detect any suspicious activity that might indicate potential attacks or misuse.
4. Firewall: A network security mechanism that filters incoming and outgoing packets based on predetermined rules, providing an additional layer of protection for network resources.
5. Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing: It involves testing a network or system to identify weaknesses or gaps that can be exploited to carry out attacks, without actually being aware of the presence of a vulnerability. 
6. Incident Response Team: An organizational unit responsible for managing and responding to security incidents that could result in damage or loss of revenue, financial information, or confidentiality concerns.
7. Threat Intelligence: It involves collecting, storing, and analyzing information about known or suspected threats, allowing organizations to quickly take action to protect their environments and stay ahead of new threats.  
8. Zero Trust Architecture: A security architecture that assumes no trusted relationships between users, devices, applications, or services, ensuring that access decisions are made solely on the basis of information provided by the user or application itself.
9. Honeypot: A fake computer system designed to catch unauthorized attempts to access sensitive information or systems during a penetration test.

Now that we have a clear idea of what these terms mean, we can move forward to explore each layer of the stack that makes up modern cybersecurity infrastructure, starting with the physical layer and working our way towards the highest level of abstraction, where tools like Artificial Intelligence and Cloud Computing really shine. 


# Physical Layer 
The physical layer consists of the electrical, optical, and wireless transmission medium underlying modern communication networks. These include cables, coaxial cords, fiber optics, telephone lines, and satellite links. At the lowest levels of the physical layer, electricity and magnetic fields are used to transmit signals over long distances, while radio waves and microwaves provide short-range communication capabilities. 

At the center of the physical layer lies the medium access control(MAC) protocol, which defines the standards for controlling and communicating over the physical medium. MAC protocols use addressing mechanisms such as media access control addresses (MAC addresses), Ethernet addresses, IP addresses, and Universal Resource Locators (URLs) to uniquely identify network nodes and communicate with them. Alongside MAC protocols, several standardized protocols also exist at the physical layer, including ARP (address resolution protocol) for mapping IP addresses to physical media addresses, IEEE 802.1X for establishing mutual authentication between network nodes, and Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) for encrypting data transmitted across wireless networks.

In addition to traditional wires, modern networks often rely on wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Zigbee, which enable users to connect to the network even if they are located far away from the main router. Wireless technology plays a crucial role in enabling mobile connectivity, making it easier for people to access information and applications regardless of their location. 

Besides the physical layer, there are also several standards and specifications that must be followed when designing, implementing, and operating networks. Some common ones are: 

1. IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac - The IEEE 802.11 family of standards specifies the radios, channel bands, and physical layer protocols used in wireless local area networks (WLANs). Each version includes slightly different features, such as increased range or enhanced security.
2. TCP/IP - Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP, is a suite of communications protocols that define how computers send messages to one another over the internet. It defines the logical structure of the internet and establishes guidelines for routing packets throughout the network.
3. IPv4/IPv6 - Internet Protocol Version 4 and Version 6 respectively, are protocols that define the format and basic functionality of internet communication. They were developed independently before the formation of the IETF, but today both versions operate side by side.
4. DNS - Domain Name System, or DNS, is a hierarchical naming system that translates domain names into IP addresses. It enables users to easily locate online resources such as websites, email accounts, and file storage services.

# Data Link Layer
The data link layer provides a reliable and error-free delivery of datagrams between nodes on a network. At its base, the data link layer runs over a point-to-point connection established over a physical medium using the physical layer protocols described above.

Datagram transmission is performed using several protocols that encapsulate the data into frames called "data links." Common data link protocols include Token Ring, Frame Relay, FDDI, and ATM. Each data link protocol operates at a lower speed than the physical layer so it is necessary to combine multiple data links together to achieve higher bandwidth. For example, synchronous optical network (SONET) combines several SFF (Small Form Factor Devices) to form a high-speed SONET circuit.

Frames consist of headers that contain metadata such as source and destination addresses and sequence numbers. Each frame is then encapsulated into a packet that contains checksums and error detection codes. Packets are then transferred to their final destination using routing protocols such as RARP (reverse address resolution protocol), OSPF (open shortest path first), or BGP (border gateway protocol). Routing protocols determine the best paths for datagrams to reach their destinations and handle any errors encountered along the way.

Moreover, data link layer protocols typically employ flow control techniques to regulate the rate at which data is sent over the network, reducing congestion and ensuring consistent performance. Flow control ensures that network resources do not overflow and queuing delays do not cause data packets to be lost. Error correction techniques ensure that corrupted datagrams are detected and removed from the network.

# Network Layer
The network layer provides logical communication between separate computer systems that may be separated geographically or logically. It connects separate nodes using logical circuits called "virtual paths" or "circuits." Virtual paths allow different parts of the network to communicate separately and prevents unnecessary interference caused by shared transmission lines.

Network layer protocols provide transportation functions for datagrams entering or leaving a node. Examples of network layer protocols include TCP (transmission control protocol), UDP (user datagram protocol), ICMP (internet control message protocol), IGMP (internet group management protocol), and IPSec (IP security protocol).

TCP is a reliable protocol that guarantees data transfer between endpoints and handles errors by retransmitting failed segments. TCP supports connections that span multiple hosts and multiplexes multiple data streams on the same connection.

UDP is less reliable but offers better performance since it does not require handshaking procedures or guaranteed delivery. UDP is mainly useful for real-time applications such as video streaming or voice over IP.

ICMP is primarily used for diagnostic purposes, reporting errors, or monitoring network activity. Examples of ICMP messages include destination unreachable (type 3), time exceeded (type 11), echo request (type 8), and timestamp reply (type 14).

IGMP allows multicast groups to be created and managed. Hosts join or leave multicast groups according to membership information received via periodic queries from routers. IGMP uses multicast addresses to identify sources rather than unicast addresses assigned to individual interfaces.

Finally, IPSec provides encryption, authentication, and privacy for IP traffic. IPSec relies on secure tunnels implemented using industry-standard cryptographic protocols such as SSL/TLS and IPsec ESP and AH headers. IPSec ensures that only authorized parties can communicate securely over the network and reduces the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data.

# Transport Layer
The transport layer provides end-to-end communication between applications running on different hosts on a network. It handles two-way communication between processes, whether they reside on the same machine or on different machines connected over a network.

Transport layer protocols typically offer several services, including multiplexing and demultiplexing of data streams, reliability, congestion control, and sequencing. Multiplexing involves combining multiple data streams onto the same connection while demultiplexing involves separating multiple data streams from a single connection. Reliability involves ensuring that data is delivered accurately, in order, and without duplication. Congestion control deals with situations where the network becomes overloaded and temporarily halts data transmission until the problem is resolved. Sequencing involves ordering of data so that receivers receive data in the correct order.

Common transport layer protocols include TCP, UDP, SCTP, DCCP, and QUIC. TCP is widely used because it is reliable and efficient, requiring fewer round trips than other protocols, especially for interactive sessions such as web browsing or email. TLS (transport layer security) is used to encrypt traffic between clients and servers. SCTP stands for stream control transmission protocol and provides support for unordered, reliable, and loss-tolerant data streams. DCCP stands for datagram congestion control protocol and works similarly to TCP but provides faster response times. Quic is a new transport protocol that uses UDP instead of TCP and improves latency and throughput compared to TCP, particularly for mobile networks. 

# Application Layer
The application layer defines the standard set of protocols that interact with users or other software components, such as web browsers, mail readers, or remote terminals. The primary purpose of the application layer is to exchange data between entities, usually called clients and servers, using predefined protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, FTP, and TELNET.

HTTP is the most commonly used protocol in the application layer, providing hypertext documents and other multimedia content over the internet. HTTPS (secure HTTP) is the secure version of HTTP that uses encryption to protect data transmitted between clients and servers. SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol) is used to send and receive emails. FTP (file transfer protocol) is used to transfer files between client and server systems. Telnet is a text-based interface used to remotely administer or configure network devices such as servers or routers. Other protocols used in the application layer include SNMP (simple network management protocol), LDAP (lightweight directory access protocol), DHCP (dynamic host configuration protocol), NFS (network file system), SMB (server message block), and NTP (network time protocol).
