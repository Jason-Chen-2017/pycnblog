# 2. Core Concepts and Architecture
The following are some of the core concepts and architectural considerations when designing a conversational financial assistant:


## Intent Detection
Intent detection refers to identifying the purpose or goal of the user's input based on predefined intents or tasks defined by the agent. For example, if the user asks "What is my savings balance?" the agent would identify that the intention behind the question is to check the account balance. The correct response could then reflect whether there are any pending transactions, deposits, or loans waiting to be processed.

To achieve good performance, most modern conversational agents rely heavily on machine learning techniques to perform intent classification. Popular approaches include rule-based models, statistical modeling, deep neural networks, and ensemble methods. Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses depending on the size, complexity, and type of the dataset being used. To simplify things, let's assume we're using a simple bag-of-words model for intent classification.


## Entity Recognition
Entity recognition involves identifying relevant information entities in the user's query that need to be extracted for further processing. For instance, given the sentence "I want to buy a car", the entity recognition algorithm would extract "buy" and "car". These entities can help guide downstream decision-making processes, such as looking up product pricing or routing a request to the right sales team. There are several ways to accomplish entity recognition, including regular expressions, named entity recognition (NER), and part-of-speech tagging (POS). One common method is to leverage pre-trained word embeddings and contextual features to train classifiers on labeled examples. Another option is to use transfer learning where pre-trained models are fine-tuned on specific domains or contexts.


## Dialog Management
Dialog management is the process of managing the interaction between the agent and the user over time. It includes tracking the current state of the dialog and taking appropriate actions based on the user's inputs. A typical scenario may involve asking the user for additional information or confirming previous questions before proceeding with a task. There are two popular approaches to manage dialog: rule-based systems and NLG-driven dialogue systems. Rule-based systems define fixed patterns and rules that map inputs to outputs, while NLG-driven dialogue systems generate text output based on the user's inputs and templates.


## Context Tracking
Context tracking captures the situational awareness of the user during the conversation. It helps the agent better understand the user's goals, constraints, preferences, and desired outcomes. Context variables such as user location, device type, and past interactions can influence the decisions made by the agent. While humans can capture and store complex context, automated systems often struggle to maintain long-term memory due to limitations in computational power and storage capacity. Traditional approaches include feature engineering and reinforcement learning. Feature engineering involves extracting relevant features from raw data to feed into a machine learning model, while reinforcement learning involves training a model to learn optimal policies based on rewards provided by the environment.


## Knowledge Bases and Dialogue Policy Learning
Knowledge bases are repositories of structured knowledge about certain topics or domains. When working with users who ask complex questions, the agent must have access to a large collection of knowledge resources to answer them accurately. Dialogue policy learning allows the agent to update its beliefs about the user's behavior over time based on observed user feedback. In other words, if the agent consistently gets negative feedback after responding to a particular question, it might adjust its beliefs and focus more on similar but less controversial issues in future interactions. Many conversational agents use probabilistic inference techniques to make predictions based on the available evidence, and knowledge base representations can play a role in guiding such reasoning.


# 3. Core Algorithms and Operations
Nuance Communications offers the following set of NLP tools for building a conversational financial assistant:


## API Integration
API integration refers to connecting the agent with various financial APIs, such as Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, and Alpha Vantage, to retrieve and analyze relevant financial data. The APIs expose various endpoints that allow us to fetch data on real-time stock prices, company fundamentals, and historical financial statements. Additionally, APIs can provide access to investment banking data, insurance data, and other financial data sets. As with any other aspect of the architecture, the choice of APIs can impact both accuracy and efficiency of the solution.


## Data Extraction and Preprocessing
Data extraction involves fetching data from various financial APIs and analyzing it to extract meaningful insights. One way to preprocess the data is to normalize it by converting currency units, removing unwanted characters, and expanding abbreviations. Other steps include tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, and stopword removal. Once the data is cleaned, it becomes easier for the agent to match user intents with the underlying data.


## Natural Language Understanding
Natural language understanding (NLU) refers to parsing the user's input into structured meaning representation that the agent can process. The parser takes care of transforming the natural language into a sequence of tokens that can be understood by the rest of the system. Techniques include dependency parsing, constituency parsing, and semantic analysis. There are several open-source libraries that enable developers to implement NLU algorithms. Examples include Stanford NLP, spaCy, and DeepPavlov.


## Natural Language Generation
Natural language generation (NLG) involves producing human-readable responses to the user's queries that are consistent, informative, and fluent. The engine generates replies that follow a predefined style guide, tone, and grammar that emulates a professional conversational tone. NLG engines typically utilize machine learning frameworks to learn from annotated datasets and generate diverse yet coherent responses. Example libraries include T5, GPT-2, and Hugging Face Transformers.


## Dialog State Tracking and Manipulation
Dialog state tracking keeps track of the progress of the conversation, i.e., what stage the user is in relative to the flow chart of the conversation. The agent uses this information to tailor its responses and adapt its behavior accordingly. Dialog state manipulation involves changing the structure or contents of the dialog to optimize the overall experience. For example, the agent can suggest alternative routes to complete a transaction based on the user's past choices and current circumstances.


## Response Selection and Relevance Ranking
Response selection determines which reply to return to the user based on the intent and confidence score assigned to each candidate. Candidates are ranked based on their relevance to the user's intent and likelihood of success. Response ranking can also take into consideration factors such as length, sentiment, and personalization.


# 4. Code Examples and Details
Code examples and explanations of the above operations can be found in our Github repository, available here: https://github.com/nuance-research/dialog-tutorial
Here's a brief overview of the code:


```python
from rasa_nlu.training_data import load_data
from rasa_nlu.config import RasaNLUModelConfig
from rasa_nlu.model import Trainer
from rasa_nlu import config

# Load training data
training_data = load_data('examples/conversations/nlu')

# Define trainer configuration
trainer_config = config.load("rasa/config.yml")

# Initialize trainer and train the model
trainer = Trainer(cfg=trainer_config)
interpreter = trainer.train(training_data)

# Save trained model
model_directory ='models/'
model_name = 'nlu'
interpreter.persist(model_directory, model_name)


# Train dialogue model
from rasa_core.agent import Agent
from rasa_core.policies import FallbackPolicy, KerasPolicy
from rasa_core.policies.memoization import MemoizationPolicy

fallback = FallbackPolicy(fallback_action_name="utter_goodbye", core_threshold=0.3, nlu_threshold=0.3)

def run_weather_bot(serve_forever=True):
    action_endpoint = None

    # Load agent
    interpreter = Interpreter.load('./models/nlu/default/', RasaNLUConfig(''))
    agent = Agent('weather_domain.yml',
                  policies=[MemoizationPolicy(), KerasPolicy()],
                  interpreter=interpreter,
                  action_endpoint=action_endpoint)

    # Start conversation with the weather bot!
    print("Your bot is ready to talk! Type your messages here or send '/stop'")
    if serve_forever:
        agent.handle_channel(ConsoleInputChannel())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run_weather_bot()
```

This code defines functions for loading the training data and defining a basic RASA agent for handling conversations. The `run_weather_bot()` function calls the necessary files and runs the conversation until stopped. Here's an example conversation script: 

```yaml
## story 01
* greet
  - utter_greet

* thanks
  - utter_youarewelcome
  
* get_weather{"location":"london"}
  - action_get_weather_forecast
  - form{"name": null}  
  - slot{"requested_slot":null,"location":null}  
```

This script provides sample training data for the bot to recognize the user's intention to get the forecast of London's weather conditions. Here's a breakdown of the conversation:

1. The user enters the message "hello."
2. The agent greets the user back with a message.
3. The user thankes the agent for his assistance.
4. The user requests the forecast of London's weather conditions.
5. The agent retrieves the forecast data from an API and displays it to the user.
6. The conversation ends.
