# 1.背景介绍


Attention mechanisms have been studied extensively for various natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, question answering, and text classification. In this article, we will explore the working of attention mechanisms in NLP models using detailed explanations with emphasis on their key concepts and mathematical formulas. We also cover some coding examples to better understand the underlying principles behind attention mechanisms. This article is for anyone who wants to get a deeper understanding into how attention works in NLP systems. Some knowledge of deep learning techniques would be helpful but not mandatory. I hope that after reading this article, you can gain insights into how attention mechanisms work in NLP applications and start building your own NLP-based applications!

Attention mechanism has emerged as an important research topic due to its significant impact in improving performance of many modern NLP models. However, it remains challenging to grasp at first sight because it relies heavily on complex neural network architectures which are difficult to interpret and understand even by trained human beings. Therefore, this article aims to provide an intuitive explanation of what attention is, why it works, and how it functions in NLP systems. By following these core principles, readers should be able to easily grasp the role of attention mechanisms in various NLP tasks and develop effective solutions. 

In summary, our objective is to create an accessible yet comprehensive resource that provides a clear and thorough understanding of attention mechanisms in NLP systems through a combination of theoretical explanations, coding examples, and illustrative diagrams. Within this framework, interested readers can access resources online or download PDF versions of the paper. They can then apply the knowledge learned during their journey to build their own NLP-based applications. Good luck!


# 2.核心概念与联系
Before diving straight into the details of attention mechanisms, let's quickly familiarize ourselves with the main concepts involved:

1. Query vector q ∈ R^n
The query vector represents the input word/phrase that the model needs to pay attention to. It serves as the starting point for generating an output sequence. The size of n depends upon the number of features used to represent words in the embedding space (e.g., GloVe embeddings). 

2. Key vectors K_i ∈ R^m 
Key vectors are generated based on each hidden state h_i from the encoder RNN. These values capture relevant information about each input token at different levels of abstraction. A larger value indicates greater importance. For example, if we use a transformer architecture, m is typically much smaller than n.  

3. Value vectors V_i ∈ R^k 
Value vectors are derived from the corresponding encoder hidden states h_i. While they do not directly affect the generation of the output, they help determine the final representation of the encoded inputs at every decoding time step t=1...T. Since k is usually less than n, attention mechanisms tend to compress high-dimensional representations into lower dimensional spaces where generalization is easier to achieve. 

4. Attention weights α_ij ∈ [0,1] 
These scalar values indicate the strength of connection between the i-th decoder time step and the j-th encoder hidden state. When multiplied with the corresponding values V_j, they produce weighted sum vectors c_ij. The formula for computing attetion weights is given below: 

α_ij = softmax(score(q,K_j)) 

where score() function calculates the similarity between the query and key vectors. Softmax normalizes them so that they add up to one across all possible connections. 

5. Output vector o ∈ R^n 
This is computed by taking the dot product of the context vector C and a projection matrix Wc. C is obtained by averaging over all key vectors according to their corresponding attention weights: 

C = \sum_{j}α_jV_j 

o = np.dot(np.tanh(C),Wc) 


Now that we know the basic components of attention mechanisms, we need to go deeper and understand exactly how they work in detail. To do this, we'll focus on two widely used attention mechanisms: Dot-product attention and Multi-head attention. Let's dive into both of them!
