# 1.背景介绍


This article is the third part of my research in information retrieval and natural language processing field. Previously I have written an article about multimodal similarity models based on deep neural networks (DNNs). In this article, we will present a novel model called “Attention-based MultiModal Information Retrieval”(AMIR) that leverages attention mechanisms to combine information from various modalities like text, image or audio in order to retrieve relevant documents with high precision. The main idea behind AMIR is to learn the attention weights for each modality using self-attention mechanism and integrate them into a unified representation space. Based on the learned attention weights, AMIR can selectively focus on important features of different modalities while ignoring unimportant ones. This way, it can capture contextual information better than traditional approaches. We also introduce two evaluation metrics such as Average Precision (AP) and Recall@k, which are used to evaluate the performance of AMIR.

In this paper, we consider three types of modalities: text, image, and audio. Each type contains its own unique features and cannot be directly combined together without some prior knowledge. Therefore, in order to achieve good accuracy in multimodal retrieval tasks, we need to explicitly incorporate the interactions between these modalities through our attention mechanism.


# 2.核心概念与联系
The key concept of attention mechanism is to assign weights to different parts of the input data so that the model focuses more on certain parts compared to others. Self-attention, which refers to attending to one position at a time, has been widely used in NLP and CV applications. It involves assigning different weights to each word in the document according to its surrounding words in addition to itself. 

Similarly, we use self-attention to learn the importance of different features of different modalities. Specifically, for each modality, we create a query vector q_i and a set of key vectors K_j for all j documents in the corpus. These vectors represent the different aspects or characteristics of the modality corresponding to i document. We then calculate the attention weight alpha_{ij} = softmax(q_i^T * K_j), where softmax function ensures that all the values sum up to 1. The weighted sum of feature representations is given by W * h, where W is a linear transformation matrix and h represents the joint representation of both text and visual/audio features extracted from the same document. During training, we maximize the cross entropy loss function over the retrieved documents and minimize the similarities between their queries and keys during inference. 

To summarize, we first extract multiple features from the documents, including text, image and audio. For each modality, we learn separate query and key vectors using self-attention mechanism. Then, we compute the attention weight between every pair of documents using the dot product operation. Finally, we concatenate the modality-specific features along with their respective attention weights to get a unified representation of the document, which serves as an input for a DNN classifier. 


# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解


## Text Modality
### Query Generation
For the text modality, we generate queries Qi using Bag of Words Model with cosine similarity measure. Here's how it works:
1. First, we remove stop words and punctuation marks from the input text.
2. Next, we convert the remaining words to lowercase.
3. We then count the frequency of each word in the input text and construct a dictionary where the keys are the unique words in the vocabulary and the values are their respective frequencies. If a word appears twice in the text, only one entry should appear in the dictionary with its frequency being doubled.
4. After creating the dictionary, we normalize the frequencies by dividing each value by the total number of words in the text.
5. Once we have normalized the dictionary, we apply cosine similarity between the query and all the documents in the collection to get the query vector qi.

Here's the mathematical formula for generating query vector for text modality:

where ||text_embedding|| denotes the length of the text embedding. Note that we divide the text embedding by its magnitude to ensure that all embeddings have equal contribution towards calculating the similarity score. Also, note that the denominator could be replaced by any constant factor since it does not affect the rankings or relevance scores of the documents.



## Image Modality
### Key Generation
We obtain key vectors Ki for each image in the collection using CNN layers followed by pooling operations. We use VGG19 architecture trained on ImageNet dataset for obtaining convolutional features from images. Here's how it works:
1. We resize each image to a fixed size of 224 x 224 pixels.
2. We subtract the mean pixel values calculated across the entire ImageNet dataset from each pixel value. This step helps the network generalize better by removing redundant information and providing useful features for detection.
3. We pass the preprocessed image through the VGG19 layers until we reach the last fully connected layer before global average pooling. At this point, we obtain a feature map of size 7x7xC where C is the number of filters applied after the last fully connected layer.
4. We then take the maximum value within each filter to produce a single vector representing the most significant features of the image. To do this, we flatten the feature maps and apply tanh activation function to scale the output between -1 and +1. We repeat this process for all the images in the collection to obtain the key vectors Ki.

Here's the mathematical formula for generating key vector for image modality:

where P and Q are dimensions of the resized image. vgg\_layer(.) is the convolutional layer applied on top of the flattened image. Since we are using tanh activation function, the resulting vector would lie between -1 and +1.



## Audio Modality
### Key Generation
We perform the following steps to generate key vectors Ki for each audio clip in the collection:
1. We preprocess the audio clips by filtering out noise, converting to monochannel, resampling and normalizing the signal amplitude.
2. We transform the raw waveform into STFT frames of size T. Each frame is further divided into overlapping chunks of size M. We assume that M is much smaller than T to avoid capturing temporal correlations among consecutive frames. 
3. We apply Fourier Transform on each chunk to obtain its spectrum. We discard the complex conjugate spectra obtained from negative frequency components to reduce redundancy.
4. We represent each spectrum as a sequence of floating-point numbers, which captures both local and global spectral properties of the sound.
5. We represent each audio clip as a fixed-size sequence of spectrograms, concatenating adjacent frames that correspond to adjacent seconds in the original recording.
6. We train a Neural Network (RNN or CNN) on the concatenation of spectrograms to obtain key vectors Ki.

Here's the mathematical formula for generating key vector for audio modality:

where rnn() is a Recurrent Neural Network or Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that takes the concatenation of all the spectral sequences in an audio clip and returns a single vector representing the most significant features of the clip. 



## Unified Representation Space
Once we have generated query and key vectors for all three modalities, we integrate them into a unified representation space using self-attention mechanism. Our goal is to learn the attention weights for each modality using a shared projection matrix W. Let's define the parameters A, B and C as follows:
A is the dimension of the unified representation vector, usually chosen to be larger than the combined dimensions of all the individual features.
B is the dimension of the projector matrices for each modality, typically chosen to be smaller than A but larger than the input dimension.
C is the dimension of the key vectors and query vectors respectively.

Our approach is to project the key vectors and query vectors onto the subspaces spanned by the columns of B respectively. Specifically, let s_b and t_b denote the subspaces spanned by the columns of B for the bth modality. We then formulate the attention weights alpha as follows:

After computing the attention weights for all pairs of documents, we multiply the modality-specific features with their respective attention weights to get the joint representation Hij, which is then fed into a DNN classifier. 

Here's the mathematical formula for computing the joint representation Hij:

where $\otimes$ denotes element-wise multiplication. $h_i$ is the modality-specific feature for the ith document and $\alpha_{ij}$ is the attention weight computed between the query vector of the ith document and the key vector of the jth document using the projected space.



## Training Procedure
During training, we optimize the objective function J over the retrieved documents d using mini-batch gradient descent. We assume that the target class labels yi indicate whether a document belongs to the positive class or the negative class, depending on whether the user clicks on the document or presses ESC key when viewing results. 

Let g(Hi,y) denote the probability of the predicted label for the ith document given the joint representation Hi. The cross-entropy loss term is given by:

where N is the number of retrieved documents, lambda is the regularization parameter, |.| denotes the Frobenius Norm of a matrix and.^T means transpose.

Next, we add the Similarity Regularization Term as follows:

where $\mathbf{D}_{\beta\beta}$ is a diagonal matrix containing exponential terms proportional to beta raised to powers from 1 to n, where n is the number of documents. $\mathbf{L}(\beta)$ is the graph laplacian of the affinity matrix formed by taking the inner product of the query vectors of all pairs of documents plus the key vectors of all pairs of documents multiplied by the attention weights $\alpha$. 

Finally, we backpropagate the gradients through the network to update the weights and bias parameters of the projection matrices W_a and W_b using stochastic gradient descent method with momentum. We also decay the learning rate over time to prevent overfitting.
