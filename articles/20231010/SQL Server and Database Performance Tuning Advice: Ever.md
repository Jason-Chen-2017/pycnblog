# 1.背景介绍


Database performance tuning is a critical task for any database management system (DBMS). In this article, we will discuss the fundamentals of indexing and statistics in Microsoft SQL Server that can help you improve your overall database performance. 

Indexing plays an important role in optimizing query execution speed by organizing data on disk into a form that allows efficient retrieval of requested information. Indexing also improves insert, update, and delete operations by allowing faster access to the required rows or records. Additionally, indexes are used during query optimization to select the most appropriate index for each query.

Statistics collects statistical information about columns and tables to help optimize query planning and filtering. These statistics include such things as minimum, maximum, average values, standard deviation, and variance, which allow query optimizer to make better estimates of how much time it will take to execute queries and determine their best possible plan.

In summary, understanding indexing and statistics in DBMS helps you achieve optimal query performance while minimizing resource usage. By following good practices, you can significantly reduce the impact of slow queries and ensure high availability and scalability of your database.

Before diving deep into the subject, let's first understand what they actually are and how they work.

## Indexing

Indexing refers to the process of creating a separate structure within a database table or index, called an index, that contains a copy of one or more columns from the original table. The indexed column(s) typically have unique values, making them ideal candidates for indexing. An index improves database performance because it reduces the amount of time it takes to search through large amounts of data. Instead of scanning every row of data in a table to find matching rows, an index can quickly locate the relevant row(s). 

Indexes are created based on specific criteria, including primary key columns, foreign keys, and date/time fields. They provide fast access to data when searching, sorting, and aggregating data. For example, if we want to retrieve all orders placed before a certain date, we can create an index on the “order_date” field using a B-tree algorithm to sort the data efficiently. Once the index has been created, accessing the corresponding order record would be very fast compared to scanning the entire table.

When creating indexes, there are several parameters that should be considered:

1. Column selection: We need to select only those columns that we expect to frequently filter or sort data by. This is crucial because indexes generally increase storage space consumption. If you don't need to filter or sort by some columns, then do not include them in the index.
2. Index type: There are different types of indexes available depending on the type of data being stored. Most commonly used types are B-trees, hash indexes, and clustered indexes. 
3. Data distribution: Depending on the workload characteristics of the application, it might be beneficial to distribute data evenly across multiple disks for improved read throughput. This can be achieved either manually or automatically by using partitioning techniques. A properly designed partitioning strategy can minimize I/O bottlenecks and maximize query processing efficiency.

## Statistics

Statistics refer to the process of gathering metadata about a particular database table or view, such as the number of rows, size, distinct value count, and range of data. The collected statistics are used by the query optimizer to create an execution plan that determines the most efficient way to retrieve and manipulate data from the table or view. Statistical information provides valuable insights into how well the database is performing and whether any improvements can be made.

Similar to indexes, statistics are updated periodically using the AUTO_UPDATE option, which specifies the frequency at which statistics are collected and updated. The interval depends on the size and complexity of the table. Additionally, if there are new inserts, updates, or deletes in the table, these changes must also be reflected in the statistics. It is recommended to enable automatic statistics collection and monitoring to maintain up-to-date statistics over time.

While both indexes and statistics play a significant role in optimizing database performance, they also have some differences. Here are some other important concepts and differences between indexes and statistics:

1. Concurrency: Indexes can be created concurrently with ongoing transactions, but updating statistics requires exclusive locks on the affected table or views. Therefore, it is advisable to schedule statistic updates during off-peak hours or after heavy write activity has ceased.
2. Storage space: While indexes occupy a relatively small amount of storage space, statistics require additional memory resources due to their higher degree of detail. This could cause performance issues if the database server does not have sufficient memory. However, excessive use of statistics can lead to incorrect query plans and suboptimal query performance.
3. Relevance: Unlike indexes, statistics are generated once per table and remain static throughout its lifetime. Thus, they may become outdated and inconsistent if the underlying data changes often. On the other hand, indexes are rebuilt whenever the associated data is modified, so they stay current. Also, since indexes can improve query response times, it is worth maintaining redundant indexes to further enhance query performance.
