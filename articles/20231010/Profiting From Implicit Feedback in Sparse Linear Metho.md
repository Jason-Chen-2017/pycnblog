# 1.背景介绍


Collaborative filtering (CF) is a type of recommendation system that predicts the ratings or preferences of users for items based on their past behavior and similar patterns in the user-item interaction data. In this article, we will explore how implicit feedback can help to improve CF performance by exploiting user interests or preferences implicitly captured through explicit interactions between users and items. We will focus on two sparse linear methods: Matrix Factorization and Poisson Factorization using both item-based and user-based collaborative filtering strategies. Moreover, we will compare these algorithms’ performance with respect to different evaluation metrics such as RMSE and MAE on real-world datasets like MovieLens and Netflix. Finally, we will identify some limitations of these methods and suggest ways to overcome them. 

Implicit feedback refers to non-observed event information that is often collected from customers or social media platforms. This type of feedback may include likes, dislikes, shares, impressions, purchases, clicks, etc., but it does not necessarily provide quantitative information about whether an action was taken or not. However, it can still be used to capture certain aspects of user preferences or interests implicitly encoded into the behavior data. For example, if a user expresses positive sentiment towards a movie, they might indicate this by clicking on a "like" button, but they do not necessarily mention what specific aspect of the movie they liked. Nevertheless, such feedback signals can potentially carry valuable insights about user preferences and interests that are difficult to infer from other factors alone. Hence, researchers have been exploring ways to leverage implicit feedback to enhance recommender systems' accuracy and efficiency. 

However, there has been limited work on leveraging implicit feedback for CF using sparse linear methods. The most popular algorithmic approaches involve learning latent features for each user and item using matrix factorization techniques. These methods assume that users and items are described by a small set of hidden factors, which represent the underlying preferences or attributes that influence their behavior. Thus, the task of reconstructing the original ratings/preferences is reduced to finding the best approximation of the observed values using only these latent factors. Therefore, although the approach seems promising, it is important to note that it assumes that all users and items share a common set of latent factors, which is rarely true in practice. As a result, latent feature representations learned in this way cannot fully capture the complex relationships present in the data. To address this limitation, several variants of these models have been proposed, such as MF-BPR (Matrix Factorization with BPR loss), NMF-BCU (Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with Binary Cross-Entropy loss), IALS (Iterated Alternating Least Squares) among others. These models exploit additional constraints, such as sparsity or completeness, to further improve the prediction quality.

In contrast to matrix factorization-based methods, poisson factorization is another technique commonly used in industry and academia for capturing implicit feedback signals. It involves modeling the probability density function of the number of times each user-item pair is interacted, instead of directly modeling the rating score. Such a model captures the idea that people tend to rate higher when they encounter new things or unusual situations compared to regular cases where they receive fewer recommendations. It also allows us to take advantage of the fact that many events, such as purchases, occur more frequently than others. On the other hand, traditional collaborative filtering typically uses binary or continuous ratings as input, making it less suitable for modeling individual preference levels without taking into account any uncertainty inherent in the problem. Additionally, poisson factorization requires much larger training data than conventional collaborative filtering methods due to its complexity. 

Moreover, because implicit feedback contains noisy and incomplete information, it can lead to high variance in predictions. One way to mitigate this issue is to use low-rank approximations of the matrices involved in the estimation process. This helps to reduce the computational cost and make the method more stable. Likewise, we need to carefully select the right hyperparameters, such as the dimensionality of the latent space, which impact the quality of the final estimates. Furthermore, one potential challenge is to determine appropriate evaluation metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods. Lastly, we must consider how to incorporate implicit feedback effectively into existing CF systems and design efficient ways to train and update the models under resource constraints.

Finally, while recent advances in collaborative filtering technologies have improved the accuracy and diversity of recommendation results, they have not always led to significant improvements in terms of business value or revenue. This could be partially attributable to the difficulty in capturing accurate preferences and interests implicitly through human behavioral signals. Other factors, such as scalability, robustness, and interpretability, remain critical challenges in building reliable and effective recommender systems. Despite these challenges, research in this area continues to grow at an ever-increasing pace and has the potential to transform the way we consume content and engage in online communities. By exploring implicit feedback mechanisms and applying them to various CF tasks, we can benefit from the benefits of modern machine learning techniques and advancements in neural networks while seamlessly integrating them into current recommendation frameworks.
