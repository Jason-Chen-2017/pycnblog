# 1.背景介绍


Symmetric encryption, also known as secret key cryptography or shared-key cryptography is a type of encryption in which the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. It relies on the mathematical properties of linear algebra to make it possible. In this article, we will cover some basic concepts and principles behind symmetric encryption, as well as how it works mathematically. We'll then implement an example Python code that uses AES algorithm to encrypt and decrypt data using symmetric encryption. Finally, we'll explore its security characteristics and limitations. 

Symmetric encryption can be useful when you need to securely transmit confidential information between two parties without exposing their private keys. For instance, if you are designing a messaging application where users exchange messages with each other, symmetric encryption ensures that your messages are not intercepted by third parties who have access to your private keys. Another common use case for symmetric encryption is password storage, where passwords must be encrypted before they are stored on a server to prevent unauthorized access. 

In order to understand the working of symmetric encryption, we first need to introduce some fundamental concepts and principles. These include: 

1. Key generation

2. Encryption function

3. Decryption function

4. Padding scheme

5. Block cipher mode

Let's go through these concepts one by one. But first, let's clarify what "symmetric" means here.
# 2. Core Concepts & Principles
## 2.1 Symmetric Encryption
### Definition
Symmetric encryption refers to any encryption method where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. The main advantage of symmetric encryption over asymmetric encryption is that it is faster and more efficient than asymmetric encryption. This is because symmetric encryption only requires a single round of encryption to produce the ciphertext; whereas asymmetric encryption typically involves multiple rounds of encryption and decryption. Additionally, symmetric encryption can easily be integrated into existing protocols and systems while asymmetric encryption may require specialized software libraries or hardware devices.

### History
The term "symmetric encryption" was coined by Eliza Borrome in 1973 [1] as part of her dissertation on cryptology. However, she had already proposed symmetric-key encryption in 1976 [2], and referred to it as simply "secret-key encryption". <NAME> introduced symmetric encryption at IBM in 1976 [3]. He based his proposal on the One Time Pad technique, which he called "Public-Key OTP" or POTP. Later versions of symmetric encryption were developed by Rivest and Shamir in 1983 [4], including Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code (CBC-MAC), Output Feedback Mode (OFB), Counter Mode (CTR), etc. All these techniques rely on a fixed-length plaintext block and a variable-length ciphertext block. 

Over time, symmetric encryption has become increasingly popular due to its simplicity, speed, and efficiency. In recent years, symmetric encryption has been used extensively for various applications such as SSL/TLS encryption for HTTPS connections, digital signature verification, and authentication protocols like OAuth 2.0.

However, symmetric encryption still suffers from several security issues. Some of them are listed below:

1. Key distribution problem: Asymmetric encryption allows the sender to distribute public keys to the receiver in advance of communication, making it less vulnerable to eavesdroppers. On the other hand, symmetric encryption requires the sender to send the key pair to the receiver. If eavesdroppers gain access to the communication channel during transmission, they could read the key pair and extract the corresponding private key, thereby gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information. To mitigate this issue, schemes like RSA encryption with Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP) can be used, which adds random padding to ensure the key pair is difficult to crack even if attackers obtain unauthorized copies of the message.

2. Key management problem: Unlike asymmetric encryption, symmetric encryption does not allow independent key management. Once the key is compromised, all data protected under that key becomes vulnerable. Moreover, rotating the key frequently would increase the risk of compromising the data. Therefore, symmetric encryption should be combined with a strong key derivation function (KDF) and proper key rotation policies to address these issues. 

3. Difficulties in implementing algorithms correctly: Symmetric encryption algorithms depend heavily on correct implementation of math functions and computation complexities. Error-prone implementations could lead to vulnerabilities in the system. In fact, many of the most widely used cryptographic libraries contain bugs and mistakes that could potentially compromise the security of the system. 

4. Limitations on performance: Although symmetric encryption offers fast encryption and decryption rates, its usage still poses some challenges. Operating large volumes of data within a short period of time requires efficient memory allocation, processing power, and disk I/O bandwidth. To address this limitation, hybrid encryption schemes like GCM and CCM modes can be used to offload certain operations to dedicated processors or accelerators. However, these technologies cannot completely eliminate the need for high-performance CPUs and GPUs. 

Overall, symmetric encryption remains a powerful tool for securing critical data, but it must also be used responsibly to avoid potential threats and drawbacks.
