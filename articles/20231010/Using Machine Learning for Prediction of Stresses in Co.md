# 1.背景介绍


Aircraft wings suffer from fatigue caused by long-term cyclic stresses such as high compressive stress (HPS), higher-order shear stress and normal strain due to deformation and wear. Predicting these damage scenarios helps maintenance engineers identify the right course of action to prevent or reduce damage to the aircraft’s wings. In this paper, we study an approach to predict wing fatigue using machine learning techniques with reference to composite materials. The proposed method is based on principal component analysis (PCA) which can be used to extract features from nonlinearly-combined response spectra obtained through Fourier transform in frequency domain. We also employ support vector regression (SVR) algorithm to model non-linear relationships between input variables and output variable. Finally, we conduct various experiments to evaluate performance of the developed prediction method and compare it with other state-of-the-art methods.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. Each principal component captures most of the information variation and its direction defines the loading directions of the original variables. Therefore, principal components are good choices to represent complex data sets while removing any redundant or noisy features.
Support Vector Regression (SVR): SVR is a type of supervised learning algorithm that fits a line or a hyperplane to the given data points, making predictions about the target variable associated with each input variable. It chooses the best line/hyperplane that minimizes the residual sum of squares between the predicted values and the actual value. Support vectors are those instances that define the decision boundary between two classes. When new data points fall beyond this boundary, they are classified according to their proximity to the separating hyperplane. This technique can handle large datasets effectively and works well when there is a clear separation between the target variables and input variables.
Fourier Transform: The Fourier transform converts a function from time-domain to frequency-domain. In our work, the fourier transform will help us obtain the characteristic spectral shape of the composite material which is useful for feature extraction. Since the responses of different modes may vary widely, we can use only one mode at a time and disregard others to capture only the dominant part of the response spectrum.
Nonlinearity: Nonlinear behavior observed in the response spectrum of composites suggests that more complex models need to be considered for accurate fatigue damage prediction. However, adding more layers to the model increases the complexity of interpretation and results in worse accuracy. To overcome this problem, we propose to use a multi-layer perceptron neural network architecture with a single hidden layer. This allows the model to learn complex patterns without relying too much on individual input features.
Training Data: The training dataset consists of experimental measurements made on wings under various conditions including temperature, pressure, wind speed, humidity etc., as well as precomputed fatigue loads calculated using numerical simulations. These inputs are combined to generate the outputs corresponding to the failure index (%strain).
Testing Data: Separate testing dataset is created to measure the accuracy of the trained model. The test data consists of previously undisclosed inputs not seen during training.

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
The steps involved in developing the proposed method include:

1. Preprocessing the data: Cleaning up the raw data by handling missing values, outliers, and normalization.
2. Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed data using PCA. The goal is to extract important characteristics of the wing response spectrum that can predict fatigue damage accurately.
3. Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning: Select appropriate machine learning algorithms such as MLPClassifier from scikit-learn library. Also, tune hyperparameters like number of neurons in the hidden layer, regularization parameter C, and kernel type for better performance.
4. Training and Testing: Split the data into training and testing sets, fit the selected model on the training data, and make predictions on the test data. Evaluate the performance metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared score to check how well the model performs.
5. Validation: Use separate validation data to select the best performing model. If necessary, repeat step 4 using different combinations of hyperparameters until the model converges towards optimal solution.

Here are some details regarding implementation of these steps:

1.Preprocessing the data: 

Data preprocessing involves cleaning up the raw data by handling missing values, outliers, and normalization. For instance, imputing missing values by interpolation techniques, detecting and dealing with outliers, and scaling the features so that all the features have similar scale could improve the performance of the model.

```python
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer 
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

imp = SimpleImputer(missing_values=np.nan, strategy='mean')
X_train = pd.DataFrame(imp.fit_transform(X_train))
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
```
2.Feature Extraction:

Using PCA, we can extract important characteristics of the wing response spectrum that can predict fatigue damage accurately. Here's the code for applying PCA to the input data:

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

pca = PCA(n_components=9) #number of principal components required
X_train = pca.fit_transform(X_train)
explained_variance = np.cumsum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_) #percentage variance explained by each principal component
```
After applying PCA, we get a reduced dimensionality of size n x m where n is the number of samples and m is equal to the number of principal components specified above.

3.Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning:

For selecting the suitable machine learning algorithm, we first try simple models like logistic regression, KNN, and random forest. Then, we explore deep learning architectures like CNN, LSTM, and MLP. During tuning, we choose appropriate hyperparameters like number of layers, activation functions, dropout rate, batch size, optimizer, learning rate, loss function, and regularization strength to achieve better accuracy. For example, here's the code for choosing a MultiLayer Perceptron classifier with L2 regularization:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout

model = Sequential([
    Dense(units=128, activation='relu', input_shape=(m,)),
    Dropout(rate=0.2),
    Dense(units=64, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(rate=0.2),
    Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

We train the model using the `fit()` function:

```python
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32, verbose=True)
```

4.Training and Testing:

Splitting the data into training and testing sets ensures that the model does not overfit the training data and provides an unbiased estimate of the performance on new, unseen data. Here's the code for splitting the data randomly:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_train, y_train, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
```

5.Validation:

Cross-validation is another way to validate the model's performance by dividing the data into k subsets, training the model on k-1 subsets, and evaluating on the remaining subset. After selecting the best performing model, we retrain it using all available data.
