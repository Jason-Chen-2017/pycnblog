# 1.背景介绍


Wireless charging is a critical component of modern smartphone battery management system that provides the power to mobile devices in short bursts when they are not in use. However, the current wireless charging techniques still face challenges such as high energy consumption and low mobility range, which results in slow speeds for users. To address these issues, we propose a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) architecture to implement a smart charging algorithm using blockchain technology that can provide substantial benefits compared to conventional centralized approaches while addressing the main drawbacks of existing solutions: its high operational costs and unfair pricing discrimination between operators. In this article, we will first introduce the concept of DAO, then describe how our approach combines blockchain with machine learning algorithms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of wireless charging. We also demonstrate our proposed methodology on an experimental platform and analyze the impact of various factors on charging performance. Finally, we discuss the potential improvements and future research directions based on our findings. 
2.核心概念与联系
Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) refers to an economic model where multiple agents operate independently without any central interference or control. The key features of DAO include transparent governance, no predefined roles or titles, self-organization through collective decision making, and automatic execution of contractual obligations. Essentially, DAOs allow groups of people to come together around shared values and ideas, create protocols and organizations that align with the interests and principles of their members, and reach consensus through automated decision-making mechanisms. Our proposed solution utilizes blockchain technology and tokenomics to formulate a decentralized organization that coordinates and manages the supply chain of electrical chargers within the electric vehicle ecosystem. By leveraging tokenomics and blockchain technology, our DAO can coordinate activities such as charging stations registration, scheduling, payment collection, pricing negotiation, and revenue sharing between different carriers, ensuring fair pricing and market competition among operators.
3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
The core algorithm behind our decentralized charging system involves two stages. Firstly, charging stations must be registered by authorized carriers on the Ethereum blockchain network. Secondly, cars registered with the blockchain network can request for charging slots from available charging stations during scheduled timeslots defined by the carrier. Once a user approves the request, the electrical vehicles start charging at the designated station. At the same time, machines connected to the charging station send real-time data to the blockchain network via LoRa radio communication protocol. This data includes information about the status of the charging process, such as remaining charge level, speed, and SOC. Using a combination of machine learning models and reinforcement learning algorithms, our DAO selects appropriate charging stations based on historical data collected from similar charging sessions, evaluates the feasibility of charging requests based on predicted demand levels, and optimizes the schedule of charging sessions based on user preferences and constraints. Moreover, our DAO uses a distributed payment mechanism that allows participants to directly pay for charging fees instead of relying on third parties like credit card companies.

In summary, our proposed solution achieves several goals. Firstly, it eliminates the need for manual intervention in charging operations, reducing the cost of ownership and increasing consumer satisfaction. Secondly, it enables rapid and reliable charging for consumers, enhancing user experience and driving sales. Thirdly, it increases transparency and accountability in the supply chain, leading to better compliance with government regulations and better decision-making in future markets.

4.具体代码实例和详细解释说明
For simplicity, let us assume that there exists a database storing records of all the carriers who offer wireless charging services and their respective charging stations along with relevant details such as location, price, availability etc. We can represent each carrier entity as a separate token on the Ethereum blockchain network. Each charging station entity can be represented as a non-fungible token (NFT), which stores unique identifiers such as serial numbers, addresses, and other attributes required to identify and track individual charging stations. 

Once a car owner registers his/her car with the blockchain network, he/she can select the preferred carrier and submit a request for charging slots. When approved, the selected carriers starts charging the user's car at one of the eligible charging stations. Upon arrival at the charging station, the electrical vehicle sends real-time data to the blockchain network. The DAO processes this data and determines whether to accept the transaction based on the charging session schedule, remaining capacity, and user preferences. If the transaction is accepted, the car owner pays for the charging fee directly using the distributed payment mechanism provided by our DAO.

Finally, if the user rejects the charging slot, the car can opt out of further charging requests until a new slot becomes available again.


Here is some sample code demonstrating how the above mentioned steps can be implemented in Python language:

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor # random forest regression model
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error # evaluate error metrics

# initialize ethereum blockchain connection
ethereum = ethereum_util.EthereumUtil()

# load datasets for training and validation
dataset = pd.read_csv('charging_data.csv')
X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values
y = dataset.iloc[:, -1].values

# splitting dataset into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)
