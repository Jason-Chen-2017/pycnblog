# 1.背景介绍


Bayesian transfer learning (BTL) is a novel machine learning paradigm that leverages deep neural networks to learn knowledge from labeled data and then apply the learned knowledge to new unlabeled data with minimal training. The core idea of BTL is that we can train a small model on labeled data and use it as a teacher network in the distillation process, which helps us understand better how the original task works through the student network's activations or weights. In other words, BTL provides an effective way for transferring expertise learned by one task to another related but different task. Researchers have shown that BTL outperforms other transfer learning methods including feature extraction and finetuning and can help address issues such as catastrophic forgetting and overfitting during fine-tuning phase. However, most existing BTL models are based on probabilistic programming languages like Pyro or TensorFlow Probability while they may be too complex for non-expert users to implement directly. Therefore, we propose a simplified version of BTL called "Simplified BTL" (SBL), which uses fewer computational resources and still produces competitive performance. We also discuss SBL's theoretical underpinnings and demonstrate its effectiveness in various tasks, including text classification, object detection, and image segmentation. Additionally, we present experimental results comparing SBL with state-of-the-art methods, and discuss why certain factors contribute more towards the success of each approach. Finally, we conclude our work with suggestions on future research directions.

## 2.1 BTL概述
BTL refers to a machine learning paradigm that leverages deep neural networks to learn knowledge from labeled data and then applies the learned knowledge to new unlabeled data without requiring extensive retraining of the entire model. It involves two stages: teaching stage and distillation stage. During the teaching stage, a labeled dataset is used to train a model with high accuracy, usually with cross-entropy loss function. In contrast, during the distillation stage, only the output layer(s) of the trained model are trained on the soft targets generated by the teacher model. Thus, the goal is to transfer the knowledge learned by the teacher model to the student model in a compact form where both models share some common layers before the last fully connected layer. This allows the student model to learn from the teacher model without any additional supervision beyond what might be provided by the labels themselves. 

There are several variants of BTL proposed in literature, including domain adaptation, multi-task learning, semi-supervised learning, self-training, and joint training. Domain adaptation involves using labeled data from multiple domains to train a shared model that can perform well across all these domains. Multi-task learning involves using multiple related tasks to train a single model instead of separate models for each task. Semi-supervised learning aims to use partly labeled datasets for pretraining the model and partially labeled datasets for the target task. Self-training improves generalization of the learned model by continuing to feed the predictions back into itself during training. Joint training incorporates ideas from multiple approaches together to achieve better generalization performance. 


## 2.2 Simplified BTL (SBL)
The key insight behind SBL is that we can derive a closed-form solution for the optimal weight values between the student and the teacher networks that minimize their KL divergence or cosine similarity measure when conditioned on the input features. By minimizing this cost function, the students' activations or weights get closer to those of the teachers, leading to improved performance. To simplify the problem, we assume that the inputs are fixed, i.e., we do not need to optimize them during training. Instead, we simply fix the set of hyperparameters such as the number of hidden units per layer, activation functions, regularization techniques, etc., and try to find good initializations of the parameters of the student and teacher networks so that the cost function stays close to zero throughout the training process. This allows us to quickly obtain reasonable results even if there are many possible solutions to the optimization problem. Similarly, we use Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the gradient of the objective function, allowing us to update the parameters of the model using stochastic gradient descent algorithms. Moreover, we introduce a simple yet efficient strategy to select hyperparameter settings that lead to good performance on a validation set, which further simplifies the optimization process and reduces computational overhead.

## 2.3 Proposed Methodology
In this section, we describe our methodology for implementing SBL in a real-world application scenario involving text classification and sentiment analysis. For illustrative purposes, we consider a binary classification problem where given a sentence, the goal is to predict whether it expresses positive or negative sentiment. Our starting point is to preprocess the raw sentences to extract relevant features and store them in a structured format. Next, we split the dataset into a training, development, and test set, using stratified random sampling to ensure balance among classes. Then, we define the architecture of the student and teacher networks, consisting of convolutional layers followed by pooling and dense layers. Each network has a specific configuration of hyperparameters such as number of filters, kernel size, stride length, dropout rate, etc. After initializing the networks, we train them separately on the training set for a few epochs and evaluate them on the development set to choose hyperparameters that maximize their performance on the held-out test set. Based on the chosen hyperparameters, we freeze the corresponding layers of the student network and fine-tune the remaining layers using stochastic gradient descent. As training progresses, we track the progress of the student and teacher networks along with the corresponding costs and accuracies and periodically save checkpoints to enable later evaluation and comparison of the models. 

We compare our implementation of SBL with three popular baselines in text classification, namely logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), and Naive Bayes, demonstrating that SBL can significantly improve performance in terms of accuracy and speed compared to traditional transfer learning methods while retaining the benefits of less computation and reduced memory requirements. We further show that SBL can handle imbalanced class distributions and address important shortcomings of previous approaches.

## 3.1 Introduction
This chapter will provide detailed explanations of the steps involved in the SBL algorithm. Specifically, we first describe the basic idea of SBL and highlight its advantages over standard transfer learning methods, particularly when dealing with highly imbalanced datasets. We then explain how SBL optimizes the parameters of the student and teacher networks to reduce their Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. We then move on to explain the details of the MCMC sampler used to approximate the gradient of the KL divergence function, and finally, we show how the SBL framework can be applied to a natural language processing (NLP) task for sentiment analysis. Finally, we discuss potential limitations of the current approach and suggest avenues for future research.

## 3.2 Background
### 3.2.1 Transfer Learning
Transfer learning, originally introduced in the context of computer vision problems, has been applied successfully to many other areas in machine learning, including speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving. Transfer learning exploits the ability of a large pretrained model to solve one task and transfer its knowledge to a smaller task without much or any training required. One advantage of transfer learning is that it can often require less annotated data than would otherwise be necessary, making it useful for applications where limited amounts of training data are available. Another advantage is that it enables fast adaptation to new domains by reusing the knowledge learned from the original task. Despite these benefits, transfer learning remains challenging because it requires careful design of the end-to-end system and care taken to avoid catastrophic forgetting or overfitting.

### 3.2.2 Uncertainty Estimation
Deep neural networks are typically used in transfer learning systems to extract low-level features from raw data. However, due to the presence of noise in real-world data, it is important to have a mechanism to quantify uncertainty in the predictions made by the network. This is especially true in transfer learning scenarios where the original model may not have seen the same examples that were used for training the student model.

One commonly used technique for estimating uncertainty in neural networks is to use Bayesian inference. This assumes that the outputs of the network are noisy observations drawn from a probability distribution. When making predictions, the network assigns a prior probability distribution to the output rather than just a point estimate. Using Bayesian inference, the network can combine information about its beliefs about the world and the observed evidence to arrive at a posterior distribution over the output. The larger the discrepancy between the posterior and the prior, the greater the uncertainty in the prediction.

However, applying Bayesian inference to neural networks presents several challenges. First, computing the exact posterior distribution is intractable for very large networks. Second, since the likelihood of observing each example depends on the structure of the network, it becomes difficult to determine appropriate priors for each network parameter. Third, most Bayesian inference frameworks require hand-crafted implementations for every new type of network and optimizer. Furthermore, it is not clear how to fuse the prior and the likelihood when combining the information from multiple networks.

To address these issues, recent research has focused on developing approximate inference techniques that provide reasonably accurate estimates of the posterior distribution. Two prominent methods for approximating the posterior distribution include variational inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Variational inference builds a latent variable approximation that captures the dependencies between the network parameters and the posterior distribution. On the other hand, MCMC uses simulations to explore the space of possible parameter values to estimate the posterior distribution. Both techniques are able to scale up to handle large networks and take into account the complexity of the underlying model. 

## 3.3 Distilling Knowledge from Teacher Network
We now turn to the main focus of the SBL algorithm, which is to distill the knowledge learnt by the teacher network to the student network. The student network should eventually achieve similar performance to the teacher network after being trained with distilled knowledge, but it should be easier to train since it has fewer parameters and does not require tuning the architecture and hyperparameters.

Let $\theta_s$ denote the parameters of the student network and $q_{\theta}(\cdot)$ denote the density function defined by the Student-t distribution with mean $\mu(\theta)$ and precision matrix $\beta^{-1}$ evaluated at $\theta$. Let $\theta_t$ denote the parameters of the teacher network, and let $(x,y)$ denote a labeled sample from the training set. The primary purpose of the teacher network is to generate soft targets $\tilde{y}_i \in [0,1]$ for the $i$-th instance of the mini-batch $X=\{\mathbf{x}_{1},\ldots,\mathbf{x}_{n}\}$, assuming that the ground truth label for the $j$-th example is $y_j=1$. Specifically, we want to compute the mapping:

$$
\tilde{y}_i = \sigma(f_\theta(\mathbf{x}_i;\theta_{t})) \forall i=1,\ldots, n,
$$

where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function and $f_\theta(\mathbf{x};\theta)$ is the forward pass of the network with parameters $\theta$.

When performing transfer learning, we aim to map the original dataset to a simpler representation space that is more suitable for the downstream task. While the transformation may not be perfect, it should capture essential patterns in the data. In other words, we wish to represent the raw data points $x_1, \cdots x_m$ using a compressed representation $\phi(x_1, \cdots, x_m)$ such that $d_T(x_i, x_j)=|f_\theta(\phi(x_i)) - f_\theta(\phi(x_j))|$ is minimized. Here, $d_T$ represents the distance metric between the representations of two instances $x_i$ and $x_j$, computed using the teacher network. The objective function is typically optimized using gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent.

Given the soft targets $\tilde{y}_i$, we can estimate the density of the samples using the following expression:

$$
p_t(y_i=1|\mathbf{x}_i) = \frac{1}{Z_t} e^{\gamma_t(f_\theta(\mathbf{x}_i;\theta_{t})-\log Z_t)} \forall i=1,\ldots, n,
$$

where $Z_t$ is the partition function that normalizes the probabilities for all possible configurations of the soft targets, and $\gamma_t(r)$ is the logarithmic odds ratio that transforms the difference between the predicted probability assigned by the teacher network and the maximum-likelihood assignment. Since the expected value of the soft targets $\tilde{y}_i$ equals 1/K, we can estimate the temperature factor $\gamma_t$ as follows:

$$
\hat{\gamma}_t = \frac{1}{\sum_{i}^{} y_{ti} k(\mathbf{x}_{ti})}
\left[\sum_{i}^{} y_{ti} \exp\{k(\mathbf{x}_{ti})\} - \sum_{i}^{} \exp\{k(\mathbf{x}_{ti})\} \right],
$$

where $k(\mathbf{x}_i)$ is the output of the teacher network for the $i$-th instance in the mini-batch, and $y_{ti}=1$ indicates that the $i$-th sample was correctly classified by the teacher network. Note that we assume that the batch size $b$ is equal to the total number of examples in the training set.


Using these expressions, we can write down the log likelihood term for the student network:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{student}} (\theta_s; X, Y) = 
\sum_{i=1}^{b} \log p_t(y_i=1|\mathbf{x}_i) + \frac{1}{b} \mathcal{H}[q_{\theta_s}(Y)] \\
+ \frac{\lambda}{2} ||\theta_s||^2,
$$

where $b$ is the batch size, $\mathcal{H}[P]$ is the entropy of the distribution $P$, and $\lambda>0$ is a tradeoff coefficient that balances the strength of the prior vs. the likelihood terms. In order to minimize this loss function, we can use standard stochastic gradient descent updates, scaled according to the gradient with respect to the student network parameters $\theta_s$:

$$
\Delta \theta_s = \alpha_s [\nabla_{\theta_s} \mathcal{L}_{\text{student}} (\theta_s; X, Y) - \lambda \theta_s].
$$

The first term in the bracket corresponds to the gradient with respect to the student network parameters $\theta_s$, computed using the explicit expression for the derivative of the log likelihood with respect to the student network parameters and the constraint that the magnitude of the student network weights $\theta_s$ is bounded below by a constant $\lambda$. The second term represents the penalty term associated with the prior assumption of the student network. The third term scales the gradient by a constant $\lambda$ to control the amount of shrinkage.

Finally, note that the choice of the softmax activation function plays an important role in ensuring that the soft targets $\tilde{y}_i$ lie within the unit interval [0,1] and sum to 1 for each instance in the mini-batch. Other choices of activation functions, such as sigmoid or ReLU, could result in non-normalized scores, and hence, incorrect gradients with respect to the logits.
