# 1.背景介绍


In the past few decades, a wide variety of software development approaches has been introduced and adopted by organizations to achieve their goals of faster delivery and better quality in product development process. Two of the most popular agile methodologies are Scrum and Kanban. Both these methodologies have emerged as valuable tools for managing complex projects that involve multiple stakeholders and various levels of expertise. In this article, we will explore both methodologies in detail with an eye towards how they can be applied effectively to modern software development environments. We will also compare and contrast them based on several factors such as their cultural fit, project scale, team structure, and technical capability requirements. Finally, we will discuss some lessons learned from using these two methods in different contexts and look ahead at what’s next for Agile Development.

Agile is a relatively new concept, but it’s gaining momentum every day. It offers a flexible approach to managing large-scale projects that allows teams to respond quickly to changing demands, adapt continuously to customer feedback, and deliver high-quality products in small increments over time. The benefits include shorter time-to-market, reduced risk, improved communication within the team, and increased flexibility when making changes or adding features to existing products. 

However, there are still many challenges faced while implementing Agile practices in practice. Some common ones include:
- Lack of understanding of principles behind the methodology: Companies often fail to understand why certain practices were chosen over others and aren't seeing its full potential. 
- Unclear roles and responsibilities between the different parts of the organization: Many companies struggle to clearly define who should perform which role during the sprints.
- Limited experience with Agile methodology in other industries: There isn’t much data available about how successful Agile implementations are in specific industries. Therefore, it becomes difficult to evaluate if applying Agile in one industry is going to result in improved outcomes compared to another.

Ultimately, whether you choose to implement Agile or not, it's essential to keep learning and constantly refining your approach and skills so you can continue to deliver value to your customers and stakeholders.

# 2.核心概念与联系
## What is Agile?
Agile is an iterative and incremental software development approach that promotes collaboration and continual improvement through the use of regular short cycles of planning, execution, and review. Agile development focuses on responding to change rather than following a predetermined plan. 

It was originally founded on empirical research conducted at the beginning of the 1990s and has since become widely accepted as a way to manage complex projects. Initially inspired by lean manufacturing techniques, it evolved into more formalized and rigorous ways of working that promote software craftsmanship, customer involvement, rapid feedback loops, and flexibility. 

The core values of Agile are:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

## Agile Manifesto Values
The Agile manifesto includes ten principles guiding the development of Agile:

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a month, with a preference for the shorter time scale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
7. Simplicity – the art of maximizing the amount of work not done – is essential.
8. Self-organizing teams focus on unblocking themselves and encouraging each other to help reach their goals.
9. Regular reflection on how to be more effective, keeps people focused on delivering business value.
10. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more efficient, then tunes itself accordingly.

## Who is involved in Agile?
There are three main actors involved in Agile:
1. Product owner: This person represents the interests of the company and ensures that all stakeholders are heard and included in decision-making. He/she also acts as the single point of contact with the client to ensure the best possible outcome.
2. Development team: These are the actual workers responsible for developing the product according to the plans made by the product owner. They are grouped into sprints (time frames) and given tasks to complete before moving on to the next task. During each sprint, members communicate regularly to share progress and receive constructive criticism. 
3. Client(s): This represents any external stakeholder that may require input or assistance in order to ensure that the final product meets the desired standards set forth by the product owner.

## How does Agile relate to Waterfall Model?
Waterfall model is a sequential and linear approach where the entire system is built upfront and tested before deployment. It follows the traditional development process and involves extensive documentation and testing at every stage. While waterfall model provides predictable results, it doesn’t allow for flexibility or adaptability. Additionally, managing long term dependencies across multiple systems and integrating new features requires significant effort that doesn’t happen naturally under Agile methodologies.

On the contrary, Agile is pragmatic, flexible, adaptable, and brings immediate feedback to the development team after each iteration. Within each sprint cycle, the team works collaboratively to build a piece of software that solves the problem and delivers value to the customer. Therefore, it enables smaller and more frequent releases, leading to higher quality and quicker response times.

Overall, the choice of Agile vs Waterfall depends upon various considerations like team size, complexity, and ability to deliver working software quickly, without compromising on quality. If required, organizations can gradually introduce Agile methodology into their current development models to ease the transition. However, awareness and willingness to learn and adapt could prove crucial for success.

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
Scrum and Kanban are two agile methodologies used to improve the speed, efficiency, and quality of software development. Both of these methodologies follow an organized and iterative approach known as "sprints" in Scrum, or "boards" in Kanban. Each sprint lasts typically for a week or two and consists of several checkpoints called "user stories." In Scrum, user stories describe functional requirements, bugs, enhancements, etc., while in Kanban, they represent cards that move between different stages. 

To understand the details of Scrum and Kanban, let us take an example of building a car. Here are the steps involved:

1. Requirement Gathering - Determine the needs of the target market and gather information and requirements from the users. Based on the analysis, create a list of tasks that need to be completed to build a car.

2. Sprint Planning - Establish a shared understanding among the team members about the upcoming sprint. Define the scope of the sprint, prioritize the tasks based on criticality and resources availability. Assign tasks to the team member responsible for completing them. Create a backlog of user stories. A sprint planning meeting typically happens once per sprint cycle, usually consisting of the product owner, scrum master, and the whole development team. 

3. Daily Standup Meeting - Developers update each other on their progress on their assigned tasks. Everyday, the team meetings begin with standups to discuss progress, blockers, and upcoming tasks. Team members share brief updates about their progress, highlight any issues or obstacles, and ask for help or suggestions if needed.

4. Sprint Review - After completion of the sprint, the team presents a demo to showcase the product functionality to stakeholders and request reviews and modifications from the clients. Discuss any areas of concern and identify ways to address them. Continue to adjust the schedule for subsequent sprints based on any new requirements.

5. Retrospective Meetings - Identify the bottlenecks and challenges faced by the team. Look at how the sprint went, what went well, what didn’t go well, and make recommendations for future improvements. Conduct biweekly retrospective meetings, held right after the sprint review meeting.

Kanban uses boards instead of sprints to visualize and organize work items. Cards representing user stories or tasks are moved from one column to another until they reach a conclusion state, such as done, cancelled, or postponed. Stages denote the status of each card and provide visual cues on the overall flow of work. 

Here are the basic elements of kanban board:
1. Columns - To track the status of each item, a kanban board usually has columns representing different stages of work. For example, New, Doing, Done.

2. Swimlanes - Swimlanes divide the board vertically into sections. Different departments or functions can be represented in separate swimlanes.

3. Cards - Cards contain the individual pieces of work, such as user stories or tasks. Each card has a unique identifier, title, description, assignee, deadline, and tags. 

4. Workflow - The workflow defines the sequence in which cards are moved from one column to another. Common workflows include “start” to “done,” “ready” to “doing,” and “todo” to “blocked.” 

5. Metrics - Tracking key metrics helps identify bottlenecks and trends in performance. Examples include lead time, cycle time, throughput, and WIP (work in progress).

Scrum and Kanban have similarities and differences, including:

1. Processes - Both Scrum and Kanban follow an iterative and adaptive approach that leverages continuous self-review and adjustments. Both also emphasize communication and transparency between the team members and the product owner.

2. Roles - Scum and Kanban have clear roles and responsibilities, including the product owner, scrum master, and developer.

3. Tools - Both Scrum and Kanban rely on various tools to facilitate the collaboration, tracking, and visualization of work.

4. Models - While Scrum and Kanban use different terminology and models, they differ fundamentally in terms of philosophy, strategy, and process.

// Java program to illustrate knapsack problem

import java.util.*;

public class Knapsack {

    // function to find maximum value 
    public static int maxProfit(int[] prices, int weight[], int W) {

        // Find optimal solution
        int[][] dp = new int[prices.length + 1][W + 1];

        // Fill first row and first column with zeros
        Arrays.fill(dp[0], 0);
        for (int i = 1; i <= prices.length; i++)
            Arrays.fill(dp[i], Integer.MIN_VALUE);

        // Compute optimal solution recursively
        for (int i = 1; i <= prices.length; i++) {

            for (int j = 1; j <= W; j++) {

                if (weight[i - 1] > j)
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
                else {

                    // Get the profit if the item is added to the knapsack
                    int inclProf = prices[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][j - weight[i - 1]];

                    // Get the profit if the item is excluded from the knapsack
                    int exclProf = dp[i - 1][j];

                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(inclProf, exclProf);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[prices.length][W];
    }

    // Main method
    public static void main(String args[]) {

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Enter number of items:");
        int numItems = scanner.nextInt();

        int[] priceArray = new int[numItems];
        int[] weightArray = new int[numItems];

        System.out.println("\nEnter the price of each item");
        for (int i = 0; i < numItems; i++) {
            priceArray[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }

        System.out.println("\nEnter the weight of each item");
        for (int i = 0; i < numItems; i++) {
            weightArray[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }

        System.out.println("\nEnter the capacity of bag:");
        int bagCapacity = scanner.nextInt();

        // Call the function to compute maximum profit
        int maxValue = maxProfit(priceArray, weightArray, bagCapacity);

        System.out.println("\nMaximum Value: " + maxValue);
    }
}
```
Explanation:
This is a simple implementation of dynamic programming algorithm for solving the knapsack problem. We start by initializing a matrix of size `(numItems+1)*(bagCapacity+1)` to store the optimal solutions for each subproblem. We fill the first row and first column with zero because no item can be selected if the bag capacity is zero, otherwise the only option would be to exclude all the items. Then, we iterate over the `numItems` rows and `bagCapacity` columns to calculate the optimal solutions for each subproblem, depending on whether the item is included or excluded from the knapsack. The base cases are handled implicitly, and the optimized solution is returned as the bottom-right element of the matrix.
