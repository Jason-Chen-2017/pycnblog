# 1.背景介绍




Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are widely used to study the genetic association between genetic variants and disease or trait in a wide range of biological systems. However, these methods have limited ability to identify candidate genes associated with complex traits that involve multiple gene interactions or confounding factors that affect only certain populations. Consequently, it is essential for scientists to conduct GWAS on a large scale to uncover new insights into complex traits across various species and cultures. In this article, we present a novel approach called PRS-based inference to address these challenges by integrating prior knowledge from different sources such as transcriptomic data and other molecular markers. We developed a software tool called PRSice (Personalized Refinement Scoring through Imputation and Completion) which can be easily applied to GWAS datasets generated from different platforms. PRSice uses reference panels consisting of thousands of common genetic variants and their functional annotations derived from genome-wide association studies on several diverse crops to obtain fine-grained imputations of unknown variants. Moreover, PRSice also considers both effects of known variants and non-genetic covariates on the target trait, thereby capturing the indirect effect of variation on the outcome. This method enables researchers to infer causal relationships between traits and variants based on strong associations identified among rare alleles, rather than simply reporting an association among significant genetic variants alone.



The rest of the article will focus on explaining the details of our approach, including core concepts, algorithmic principles, step-by-step operation instructions, mathematical models, specific code examples and detailed explanations. It will also discuss potential future directions and challenges in the field of personalized refinement scoring approaches to GWAS, and summarize relevant literature reviews. The final section will include frequently asked questions and answers related to GWAS in general and PRS-based inference in particular.


In summary, this work provides a powerful computational framework to analyze the genetic architecture of complex traits using GWAS while taking into account indirect effects due to numerous variables. Specifically, we propose a novel method called Personalized Refinement Scoring (PRS) that combines genotype information with auxiliary variables obtained from high-throughput sequencing analyses to improve variant imputations. By leveraging rich bioinformatics resources and incorporating prior knowledge about the underlying genetics, PRS offers unique insights into how individual variations contribute to the development of complex traits. Our proposed method has applications in a wide range of biological fields where interdisciplinary collaborations between biologists, computer scientists, and statisticians are needed to understand genetics at an unprecedented scale.

## Core Concepts

Before delving deeper into the technical details of our approach, let's first introduce some fundamental concepts involved in personalized refinement scoring (PRS). 

### Kinship Matrix
Kinship matrix refers to the pairwise relationship between individuals measured by kinship coefficients such as Heterozygosity Ratio (HR), Allele Frequency (AF), Dominant/Recessive Variant Count (DVC) etc. A kinship coefficient measures the degree of similarity between two individuals and is commonly calculated using genotype data. It ranges from -1 (two unrelated individuals) to 1 (two identical individuals). Population genetic studies typically use multi-ancestry or admixed samples to estimate population-specific kinship matrices, but single-ancestry studies often rely on family-based estimates instead. 


To ensure the correct interpretation of PRS results, it is important to carefully check whether the kinship matrix being used matches the sample collection strategy employed in the original GWAS study. For example, if the GWAS was performed on only a subset of families or genera within the same culture, the kinship matrix should not be considered representative of the true structure of the overall population. Similarly, a single-parental pedigree or cross-ancestry dataset may produce biased estimates of kinship when compared to a more complete multi-ancestry dataset. Therefore, care must be taken when interpreting PRS results to ensure fair comparisons across different sample collections. 



### Model Assumptions
Our model assumes that the genetic contributions to a trait are partially attributable to its environmental context and to genetic factors acting independently or sequentially in a specific order, known as Mendelian randomization. Mendelian randomization implies that any genetic factor influences one variant’s effect only through its downstream effects on affected individuals, rather than backpropagating through earlier genes. According to this assumption, the set of all genetic variants that influence the trait must contain sufficient redundancy to explain the observed heterogeneity in phenotypic responses. Any additional variation cannot account for the observed trait response without considering it explicitly. If the observed variance is too small relative to the number of independent components, then the model assumptions may need to be relaxed in order to capture the complexity of the underlying genetic mechanisms.


Furthermore, our model makes several implicit assumptions regarding the role of different types of variants, including recessive, dominant, and intermediate alleles. These assumptions depend on the strength of selection against recessive alleles in the trait under consideration, and they may need to be adjusted depending on the background of the organism being studied.
