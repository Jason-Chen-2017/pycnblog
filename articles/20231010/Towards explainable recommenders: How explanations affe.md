# 1.背景介绍


Recommender systems (RS) have become an essential component of modern digital platforms such as social media, e-commerce, and streaming services that provide personalized recommendations to users based on their past behavior or preferences. While these systems are becoming increasingly popular due to the convenience they offer, their impact on user decisions has not been fully explored yet. In this article, we will study how human explanations of RS can influence individual user decisions in two real-world scenarios: recommending movies and predicting stock prices. These examples highlight the importance of understanding the factors influencing user decisions and providing relevant explanation to them in order to improve user experience and satisfaction. 

In general, explaining why a recommendation was made is known as "explanation generation", while using available information for making predictions without explanation is called "black box" prediction. Despite both approaches being widely used, it remains a challenging problem to understand the interplay between these components and the effectiveness of explanation in achieving better outcomes for users. The goal of this research is to address this gap by identifying key factors and mechanisms driving user behavior with respect to rating movies or selecting stocks and designing appropriate explainability techniques. 

 # 2.核心概念与联系
Explanation generation and black box prediction are two main types of RS algorithms used for generating personalized recommendations and forecasting stock prices respectively. 

For explanation generation, the output generated by the system should be human-interpretable and consistent with the underlying data and model. There exist several explainability methods such as feature attribution, LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) etc., which use local models or perturbation analysis techniques to identify important features contributing towards the predicted outcome.

On the other hand, for black box prediction, there is no explicit mechanism for interpreting the contributions of each input variable to the final prediction. However, some surrogate models, such as random forests or neural networks trained on synthetic noise added to inputs, provide approximations of the true model and can be interpreted qualitatively and quantitatively. 

To further enhance the accuracy and relevance of explanations, various optimization techniques are employed such as multi-objective learning, adversarial learning, and federated learning.

In summary, while the former approach provides more detailed insights into the reasons behind predictions, the latter offers less subjective but objective estimates. Combining these two methods could lead to improved accuracy and efficiency of RS systems while also ensuring transparency and accountability for users.

This section details the overall process involved in the ratings movie scenario and the stock price prediction task, along with the mathematical formulas used for implementing these tasks. We will also discuss about the different explainability methods used for rating movies and the optimization techniques applied during stock price prediction.


## Rating Movie Recommendation

 ### Algorithm 
The algorithm for rating movie recommendation uses collaborative filtering technique that considers user’s previous ratings and similarities between movies. It assigns scores to all movies and then selects top K movies based on these scores. The steps involved in rating movie recommendation are as follows:

1. Data Preprocessing – This involves cleaning, normalizing, and preparing the dataset.
2. User Based Collaborative Filtering - Here, we find out what other people like and rate the same things as you, and suggest those items to you. To do so, we calculate the similarity matrix between the users and the movies, and multiply it by the rating vector of the current user to get the predicted score for every item he/she hasn’t rated before. Then, we sort the items according to the predicted score in descending order and select the top k ones. 
3. Item Based Collaborative Filtering - Similarly, we find out what other items liked by others who liked the given item, and use the ratings from those users to make a prediction for the given item. To implement this method, first, we build a similarity matrix between the movies using co-occurrence counts. Then, for each movie i, we sum up the ratings of j from all other users who liked i, and divide by the number of times i appeared in the training set. Finally, we normalize the resulting score vector to obtain the predicted ratings for the unrated items and rank them accordingly.
 
### Optimization Techniques
Several optimization techniques were used to improve the performance of the collaborative filtering algorithm. Some of the common optimization techniques include: 

1. Regularization - Regularization adds penalty terms to the cost function that discourage complex models. Common regularization techniques used in collaborative filtering include L1 and L2 regularization.
2. Normalization - Normalization helps to avoid numerical instabilities when computing dot product values. By subtracting the mean rating value and dividing by the standard deviation, the ratings are normalized across users and items. This reduces the scale of the features and helps to ensure that one user's preference for a particular item doesn't overwhelm another user's preference.
3. Learning to Rank - A supervised learning approach where we train a classifier to rank the recommended movies based on their attributes. This allows us to capture the relationship between the different attributes of movies and their ratings. For example, if a high budget movie receives many positive ratings, it might be likely to receive higher ranks than a low-budget movie with only few ratings.

### Explainability Methods
Various explainability methods have been proposed to generate explanations for movie recommendations. Some of the commonly used methods include:

1. Feature Attribution - A simple approach where we attribute each rating received by a user to specific features associated with that movie. For example, if a user likes action movies, the system would assign more weight to features related to action like genre, theme song, acting performances, etc.
2. Gradient Boosting Machine - GBMs learn to optimize a loss function iteratively through multiple iterations of gradient descent. By observing the gradients produced during backpropagation, GBM computes a weighted contribution of each feature to the final predicted score. This gives rise to global interpretations of the model.
3. LIME - Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) attempts to explain the predictions of a machine learning model locally, by considering a subset of instances around the point of interest. It works by fitting a simpler local model to the instance of interest, and using the learned coefficients to compute a linear approximation of the difference between the original model's prediction and the simplified model's prediction. This produces a local interpretation of the model.

Overall, the rating movie recommendation system generates accurate recommendations but lacks clear and transparent explanations of its reasoning. 


## Stock Price Prediction

### Algorithm

Stock price prediction requires building a model that takes historical financial data as input and outputs a continuous-valued prediction for the future stock prices. One way to accomplish this is to use time series forecasting techniques such as LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) Neural Networks.

LSTM neural network architecture consists of input layers, hidden layers, and output layers. Each layer processes the data sequentially by taking in the previous output(s) as input(s). An LSTM unit contains three gates: forget gate, input gate, and output gate, which control the flow of information into and out of the cell state. The forget gate controls which information to discard from the cell state, the input gate controls which new information to add to the cell state, and the output gate determines what information to output from the cell state.

After processing the input sequence, the last output of the LSTM units is passed through a dense layer to produce the final prediction. Different variants of LSTM architectures such as GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) and Convolutional LSTM (CLSTM) can be used to reduce memory usage and improve computational efficiency.

During training, the LSTM neural network learns to predict future stock prices by minimizing the error between predicted and actual stock prices. During testing, the LSTM neural network makes single-step predictions, which are then fed into an optimizer algorithm to refine the results.

### Optimization Techniques

Other optimization techniques used for improving the performance of stock price prediction include hyperparameter tuning, ensemble methods, early stopping, and batch normalization. Hyperparameters specify the architecture, activation functions, and learning rates of the LSTM neural network. Ensemble methods combine multiple LSTM models to create more robust and stable predictions. Early stopping stops the training process when the validation loss starts to increase, preventing overfitting. Batch normalization aims to stabilize the distribution of the input data to prevent vanishing gradients.

### Explainability Methods

There are several ways to explain the predictions of LSTM neural networks. One common method is to visualize the learned weights of the network, which show the strength of each connection between neurons. Another approach is to generate attributions, which measure the importance of each input feature to the final prediction.
