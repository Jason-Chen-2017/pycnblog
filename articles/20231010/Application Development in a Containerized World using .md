# 1.背景介绍


The rise of microservices architecture has revolutionized the way developers build applications, but it also presents new challenges to application development. Containers provide an efficient way for building and running software applications while abstracting away underlying hardware details. With the advent of container orchestration systems like Kubernetes, developers can now easily manage and scale their services on cloud platforms such as AWS or Google Cloud Platform. In this article, we will see how easy it is to develop containerized applications with Docker and Spring Boot framework. We will explore various concepts related to containers and microservices along with some hands-on examples that demonstrate how these technologies work together. Finally, we will talk about future trends and challenges of developing containerized applications using these two tools.



Let’s get started! 

# 2.核心概念与联系
Before discussing any technical details let’s first define few key terms and understand how they interact with each other. Let’s start by defining three main components of a containerized application - image, container, and registry. 

## Image
An **image** is a read-only template used to create a container. An image contains all the dependencies required to run a piece of software - code, runtime environment, system libraries, etc. Images come in different formats depending upon the type of software being packaged, such as Docker images, OCI (Open Container Initiative) images, RPM files, DEB packages, etc. Each image consists of one or more layers which represent filesystem changes from the base layer. The bottommost layer represents the most basic version of the image, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Images are typically built using a Dockerfile, which is a text file containing instructions for building the image. A sample Dockerfile might look something like this:

```Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY.mvn.mvn
COPY mvnw pom.xml./
RUN chmod +x./mvnw &&./mvnw dependency:go-offline

COPY src src
RUN./mvnw clean package

FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine
VOLUME /tmp
EXPOSE 8080
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/target/*.jar app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom","-jar","/app.jar"]
```

In this example, we use multi-stage builds to compile our application during the `builder` stage and copy only the compiled artifact during the final stage. This helps reduce the size of the resulting container since the intermediate build artifacts are discarded afterward. 

Images are stored either locally or remotely in repositories called registries. Registries enable sharing and collaboration amongst developers around the world, making it easier to reuse pre-built images and reducing development time and costs. There are many public registries available, including Docker Hub, Quay, JFrog Artifactory, and AWS Elastic Container Registry. When deploying a containerized application, the developer specifies the name of the image in addition to the configuration settings necessary to launch the container.  

## Container
A **container** is a lightweight instance of an image that runs on top of the host machine's operating system kernel. It shares the same Linux namespaces, networking stack, and storage stack with the host machine, allowing multiple containers to be run simultaneously without interfering with each other. Containers are created from images using a process known as containerization. Once launched, a container can be managed using commands like `docker run`, `docker stop`, and `docker rm`. Additionally, containers can be deployed onto container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, which allow them to be scaled horizontally across a cluster of machines, dynamically assigned resources, and self-healing capabilities.

Each container has its own isolated set of resources, including CPU, memory, disk space, network interfaces, and PID namespace. These resources are allocated from a pool of shared resources on the physical server or virtual machine hosting the container engine. As a result, containers offer a flexible and resource-efficient way to run applications. Moreover, security features like user permission isolation, seccomp (secure computing mode), AppArmor (application armor), and SELinux (security enhanced linux) ensure that containers are secure even if compromised. 

## Registry
A **registry** is a service that stores and distributes container images. It acts as a central repository for container images where users can push or pull images to share with others. Registries can be public, private, or hybrid, hosted on-premises or in the cloud, and can support multiple image architectures and protocols. Public registries include Docker Hub, GitHub Packages, Azure Container Registry, Quay, and JFrog Artifactory. Private registries, on the other hand, are typically hosted within organizations and accessible only through company firewalls or VPN connections. Hybrid registries combine elements of both public and private clouds to offer best-of-both-worlds solutions.

Now that we have defined the three core components of a containerized application, let’s discuss how they interact with each other.

## Microservices Architecture 
Microservices architecture refers to a design approach in which complex applications are composed of small, independent processes communicating over well-defined APIs. Each process is responsible for implementing one specific business capability, enhancing scalability and resilience, and being owned by a single team or organization. The term was coined by Martin Fowler and his colleagues in 2014. Microservices architecture allows teams to independently develop, test, deploy, and scale their applications, enabling faster time-to-market and better agility. They also address the complexity of building large, complex applications by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts. 

One advantage of microservices architecture is that it enables companies to break down large monolithic applications into smaller modules that can be developed, tested, and released individually. This leads to improved flexibility, agility, and scalability because teams can choose to operate independently on their services. However, there are drawbacks too. Microservices architecture requires greater coordination between teams, requiring more skills and expertise than traditional monolithic applications. Moreover, testing, debugging, and scaling microservices require specialized tooling, infrastructure, and processes. Overall, microservices architecture may not always be the right fit for every application. 

To implement microservices architecture, developers often use several techniques, including service-oriented architecture (SOA), event-driven architecture, API gateways, and service discovery mechanisms. 

### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) defines the principles and patterns for integrating enterprise applications and services. SOA breaks down applications into individual services that communicate via standardized communication protocols and data models. Services exchange data using interfaces rather than relying on direct access to databases, ensuring loose coupling and increased modularity. Developers working on separate services can use different languages and frameworks, improving portability and maintainability. SOA simplifies integration efforts by providing a consistent interface contract and eliminating the need for custom integration code.

### Event-Driven Architecture
Event-driven architecture decouples components by triggering events instead of executing directly. Events can be generated by internal actions or external events, such as user interactions, messages from other services, or errors. Components react to events asynchronously and perform minimal processing until they acknowledge receipt of the event. Events can help improve responsiveness, reliability, and scalability of applications by moving computationally expensive tasks off the critical path of execution.

### API Gateway
API Gateway serves as a front-end gateway for incoming requests. It receives client requests, routes them to appropriate back-end services, aggregates responses, caches responses, and applies additional business logic. It also provides monitoring, logging, authentication, and rate limiting capabilities to protect backend services against attacks and overload. API Gateways help simplify the interaction between clients and services by removing the burden of dealing with the complexity of distributed systems.

### Service Discovery
Service discovery enables applications to locate and communicate with each other over dynamic IP addresses or DNS names. Applications register themselves with a registry when they start up and keep renewing their registration periodically. Clients then query the registry for the location of the requested service and communicate with it. By utilizing service discovery, applications become more robust, fault tolerant, and scalable, especially in dynamic environments where services are rapidly added or removed. 

## Docker
Docker is a technology that enables developers to create, deploy, and run applications inside portable containers. It offers a simple yet powerful method for packaging and shipping applications without having to worry about configuring or managing servers, virtual machines, or cloud providers. Instead, developers can concentrate on writing code and building beautiful, reliable, and cross-platform applications. Docker containers are isolated from the rest of the system and can be run anywhere, including local development environments, cloud platforms, and production environments. 

To create a Docker container, developers write a Dockerfile which specifies the steps needed to assemble the image. The Dockerfile usually begins with a base image, which is the starting point for adding additional files and dependencies. For example, a Dockerfile for a Node.js application could begin with the following line:

```Dockerfile
FROM node:latest
```

This tells Docker to use the latest version of the official Node.js image as the base for the new image. Next, the Dockerfile adds any necessary files to the container and sets up the command to execute once the container starts. Here is an example Dockerfile for a simple Node.js application:

```Dockerfile
FROM node:latest

WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json./
RUN npm install
COPY..

CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

Once the Dockerfile is written, developers can use it to build the Docker image, which creates a layered filesystem that includes everything needed to run the application. Then, they can tag and push the image to a remote repository so that other developers can download and run the application using the `docker run` command. Tools like Docker Compose can automate the creation of multiple containers for larger, more complex applications. 

Lastly, Docker provides security features like user permissions isolation, seccomp (secure computing mode), AppArmor (application armor), and SELinux (security enhanced linux) that make it possible for developers to secure their containers against vulnerabilities and threats. Furthermore, Docker's ability to run containers on Windows and macOS makes it compatible with existing development workflows and provides a seamless experience for developers who don't want to change their existing tools. 

## Spring Boot
Spring Boot is a platform for building stand-alone Java applications that can be executed by the java command or embedded in a web server. Spring Boot takes care of much of the complexity of Java app development, such as setting up the classpath, auto-configuring Spring components, and providing a range of management endpoints. Its conventions and defaults eliminate boilerplate code and make it easier for developers to get started quickly. Spring Boot also simplifies deployment by packaging the application as a single executable jar or war file, along with its dependencies. 

Developers can take advantage of Spring Boot by writing classes annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` that contain annotations that specify the configuration and components to load at startup. Here is an example class annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

This class configures Spring Boot to automatically detect and configure the required components based on its presence in the project's classpath. Developers can then add any necessary XML or property files to customize the behavior of the application. 

Spring Boot simplifies the integration of third-party libraries by automatically downloading and configuring them based on their maven coordinates. Developers can also control which version of the library to use by specifying the version number in the POM file. Lastly, Spring Boot provides convenient ways for injecting configuration properties and values into components using annotations and environment variables.
