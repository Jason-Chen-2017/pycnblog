# 1.背景介绍


BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a state-of-the-art language model that can be fine-tuned and trained on large text corpora to learn domain specific representations of texts. It has been demonstrated to outperform other state-of-the-art models like Word2Vec or GloVe by achieving significant improvements in various natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, machine translation, and question answering. In this article, we will demonstrate how BERT can be used for transfer learning applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Specifically, we will go through the following steps:

1. Fine-tuning pre-trained BERT models with your own data: We first train our own neural network classifier using BERT embeddings for a specific task (e.g., sentiment classification). This approach allows us to adapt BERT's learned representation of words and sentence structures for the new dataset.

2. Preparing your own data set: Once we have obtained the fine tuned BERT model, we need to prepare our own labeled dataset for training the downstream classifier. The best way to do this is to collect a diverse set of examples for each class in your task. 

3. Finetuning BERT with the prepared dataset: Next, we fine tune BERT on our labeled dataset to further improve its performance. Here, we only update the weights of the final layer(s), so all the previously learned features are retained while updating them for our task. 

In summary, by using transfer learning, we can obtain high quality pre-trained models that generalize well across different tasks and datasets. By fine tuning these models with custom labeled datasets, we can achieve better results in a wide range of NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, machine translation, and question answering. Finally, the methodology described above applies to any type of transformer based architecture, not just BERT. 

Let's move ahead to understand the details behind each step involved in applying transfer learning for NLP applications.
# 2.Core Concepts and Relationships
## 2.1 Representation Learning
Representation learning refers to the process of automatically extracting meaningful features from input data. In the case of natural language processing, we extract meaning from the raw textual information present in documents using techniques like word embedding, bag-of-words models, convolutional neural networks etc. These extracted features are then fed into an algorithmic model to make predictions or generate outputs. 

However, in many cases, it would be very expensive and time consuming to manually create feature vectors for every unique document in our corpus. Moreover, there could be millions of possible combinations of words and sentences that could form the basis of our feature space, making it impractical to try and capture all of those features explicitly. Therefore, one solution to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space is to leverage pre-trained models which have already been trained on large amounts of textual data and thus come with rich internal knowledge about language structure and semantics. One example of such a pre-trained model is Google's BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).

## 2.2 Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
BERT is a popular pre-trained deep learning model that was published by researchers at Google AI Language team in May 2019. It stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, and was designed to solve the challenging task of language modeling. Given a sequence of words, BERT generates continuous numerical values that represent the underlying meaning of the sentence. 

The main idea behind BERT is to introduce two types of components called encoders, which encode both context and content of each word in the sentence separately. Each encoder takes a fixed sized segment of the sentence, processes it, and produces a vector representation of size d (d is usually around 768 dimensions). The output of the last encoder in the forward direction also contains some useful metadata that helps in generating the next word in the sentence. In other words, the encoders provide more comprehensive context for each token than simple concatenation of the previous tokens.

After encoding the entire sentence, BERT concatenates the outputs of the two encoders and applies feedforward layers to produce the final output prediction distribution over the vocabulary. During training, BERT simultaneously learns the weights of all the parameters in the network, including the weight matrices of the two encoders, without any supervision from labeled data. To prevent the model from overfitting during training, dropout regularization is applied to randomly drop out some of the neurons during training. Similarly, during inference, dropout is disabled to obtain accurate predictions. Overall, BERT provides good accuracy on several natural language processing benchmarks.


## 2.3 Why Transfer Learning?
Transfer learning is a powerful technique that enables us to train a new model on top of a pre-existing model by leveraging its existing knowledge and improving its ability to perform a particular task. For instance, if we want to classify images of animals vs birds, we don't need to start from scratch because most of the features common to both classes are already captured in a pre-trained CNN. Instead, we can simply add a few layers on top of the pre-trained network and train the whole thing end-to-end.

Similarly, when working with natural language processing problems, we often encounter scenarios where similar inputs (text messages, videos, etc.) share similar characteristics. For instance, reviews about movies sharing similar attributes such as genre, duration, cast members, director, ratings, etc. might exhibit some underlying patterns and relationships. Using transfer learning we can quickly train a model on these shared features and apply it directly to unseen data points belonging to other categories. Additionally, since the pre-trained models are generally less computationally intensive compared to traditional algorithms, they can handle massive amounts of data efficiently.
