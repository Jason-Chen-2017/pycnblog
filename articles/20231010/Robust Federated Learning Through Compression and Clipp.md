## Federated learning: A distributed machine learning technique for training large models on decentralized data
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that enables the training of large-scale deep neural networks by distributing model updates across multiple devices or servers without sharing any sensitive data. FL can leverage the large amounts of unstructured and/or private data available today to train models that are otherwise impractical to train locally using local datasets alone. However, in many cases, there exist concerns over privacy protection as well as accuracy loss due to malicious activities or unintended biases introduced during data collection, processing, and distribution. Therefore, it becomes essential to ensure fairness, transparency, and robustness in federated learning systems.

In this paper, we propose an approach called Robust Federated Learning through compression and clipping (RFLC), which provides a way to regularize the gradients before updating the global model at each round of FL. We compress the gradient vector using floating point number formats with reduced precision such as half-precision float format or integer quantization methods. Moreover, we clip the updated model parameters to prevent them from growing beyond reasonable limits, thus providing additional robustness against adversarial attacks. In addition, we use statistical moments to measure the dispersion of gradients during training, which helps identify outliers and reduce their contribution to update the global model. 

By combining RFLC techniques, we hope to address these issues related to privacy protection, accuracy loss, and robustness in federated learning systems while maintaining high performance and efficiency. This article will provide an overview of RFLC alongside existing solutions like differential privacy and adaptive clipping, discuss its advantages and limitations, and illustrate its practical application scenarios.

# 2.Core Concepts and Connections
To understand how RFLC works, let's first review some key concepts. 

1. Gradient Quantization Techniques: Floating point numbers are used in all modern deep learning architectures, but they require significant memory bandwidth to transmit and store. To mitigate this issue, various techniques have been developed to represent real values as integers or fixed-point representations. One popular method is binary netowork, where weights and activations are represented as binary values. Another technique is quantization, which involves reducing the precision of floating-point values to a lower level of bits to reduce memory footprint.

2. Global Model Parameter Distribution: The purpose of federated learning is to distribute the model parameters to different clients so that each client trains the model on their own data subset. After several rounds of communication between the server and clients, the server aggregates the updates received from the clients and sends them back to the clients.

3. Gradient Compression Techniques: Various techniques have been proposed to compress the gradient vectors obtained after backward propagation before sending them to the server for aggregation. Some common methods include weight clustering, random pruning, and layer-wise parameter quantization. By applying these techniques, we can achieve compressed model updates with improved storage and transmission costs. 

4. Gradient Clipping: Gradients can grow too large if they are not properly scaled up or clipped. This can cause overflow errors or instability in the optimization process. Similarly, certain activation functions like sigmoid can produce very large outputs when inputs become large. As a result, it is important to apply proper scaling or clipping techniques to avoid numerical instability and vanishing gradients. 

5. Statistical Moments Measuring Dispersion: In order to detect and remove outliers from the aggregated gradient updates, we need to measure the spread or dispersion of individual gradients within a batch or epoch. There are two commonly used measures for measuring dispersion - variance and standard deviation. Both of these measures are based on the assumption that the population samples are normally distributed, making them less effective in identifying extreme values compared to other metrics such as quartile range or interquartile distance. Instead, we can use statistical moments, which are more flexible and resistant to outliers than traditional measures. For example, we can calculate skewness and kurtosis of the gradient updates, which capture the shape and the tail behavior of the distribution, respectively.
