# 1.背景介绍


Apache Kafka Streams is a client library for building real-time streaming applications based on the Kafka messaging system. It provides APIs in Java and Scala for creating message streams, transforming messages, and aggregating data as they move through a pipeline of connected processors. In this article, we will discuss how to use Kafka Streams API in practical scenarios such as filtering, enrichment, and aggregation using examples written in Java and Scala. We will also cover some key concepts behind stream processing systems like event time, fault tolerance, state management, etc., which are essential for developing real-time streaming applications with high throughput.

This article assumes that readers have familiarity with basic programming principles, including variables, data types, control flow statements, loops, functions, classes, object-oriented programming, and concurrency concepts. Additionally, it requires knowledge of Apache Kafka basics, including brokers, topics, partitions, producers, consumers, and consumer groups.

Before proceeding further, let’s understand the problem statement: What are real-time streaming applications and why should developers use them?

Real-time streaming applications enable business processes to process incoming events in near real-time. This allows organizations to make fast decisions based on changing customer behavior, product availability, and other critical factors. Examples of real-time streaming applications include inventory tracking, fraud detection, sentiment analysis, location monitoring, clickstream analysis, and many more. The main goal of building real-time streaming applications is to provide users with immediate results and to optimize workflows by reducing latency and errors. However, developing real-time streaming applications can be challenging because of various technical challenges related to scalability, performance, reliability, security, and operational complexity.

With Apache Kafka Streams, developers can build highly reliable, scalable, and resilient real-time streaming applications without worrying about complex distributed systems architecture, managing message storage, and handling failures. With Kafka Streams, developers only need to write code that defines the application logic, without having to deal with complex infrastructure concerns. All these tasks are taken care of under the hood by Apache Kafka Streams, making it easier for developers to focus on writing meaningful code.

In summary, using Apache Kafka Streams makes it easier than ever to develop real-time streaming applications, enabling businesses to make faster, better-informed decisions in real-time. This article will help developers get started quickly and start building production-grade streaming applications within their organization. Let's dive into learning Apache Kafka Streams!

## 2.1 Event Time vs Processing Time
Event time refers to the actual occurrence time of an event, while processing time refers to the time when an event is processed by a processor. Both kinds of times have their own advantages and disadvantages.

### Event Time 
The advantage of event time is its accuracy, especially if the source of events has a well-defined timestamp. For example, if we receive data from a sensor device, we know exactly when each reading was taken, and hence our application can perform calculations based on those timestamps accurately. Moreover, event time enables us to perform windowed computations over large datasets, effectively handling outliers and noise. Therefore, event time is ideal for computing metrics and performing anomaly detection.

However, event time suffers from limitations such as clock skew between different sources, delayed arrival of events due to network delays, and non-determinism caused by parallel processing. To address these issues, Apache Kafka Streams supports automatic watermark generation, which tracks the progress of event time across multiple topics and ensures that all events seen so far have been processed before allowing lagging data to expire.

### Processing Time
On the other hand, processing time does not rely on any specific source of time information, but rather relies solely on the order in which events occur. As long as there is no unusual delay in the input stream, processing time guarantees that every event is processed roughly in the same amount of time. Consequently, processing time is best suited for applications where the input data is completely independent of external time references (e.g., IoT devices). Moreover, processing time can handle non-event data as well, whereas event time cannot.

Finally, both event time and processing time have their strengths and weaknesses depending on the context of the application. For example, most IoT applications involve processing large amounts of continuous data, where the cost of maintaining accurate event time may not be worthwhile. On the other hand, finance and healthcare applications typically require low latency, precise computation, and strict data integrity. Thus, selecting the right timing mechanism is crucial for achieving optimal results.

## 2.2 Key Concepts
Before diving deep into how to use Apache Kafka Streams, let's first go over some important core concepts and terms used in stream processing. These concepts form the foundation of Apache Kafka Streams API, and understanding them will help you navigate the rest of the documentation.

### Topics and Partitions
A topic is a logical concept representing an ordered sequence of records that share a common theme. Each record in a topic belongs to one partition, identified by a unique identifier. A topic is divided into multiple partitions for horizontal scaling and load balancing purposes. Records within a partition are guaranteed to preserve the order of ingestion. Partitioning helps keep data organized and allow for efficient parallelization of processing.


Each partition is replicated across multiple servers within a cluster, ensuring fault tolerance and high availability. Replication increases the overall capacity of the topic, thus improving its scalability and reliability. However, replication comes at a cost of increased bandwidth usage and slower reads and writes to replicas. Thus, it is important to carefully choose the number of partitions and replication factor based on the expected traffic and consistency requirements of your application.

When producing new data to a topic, clients specify a partition ID, which determines which partition the data is placed in. If no explicit partition is specified, then the producer uses a round robin algorithm to distribute data evenly among available partitions. Clients can optionally set a key associated with each record, which can be used for routing or grouping purposes.

Consumers subscribe to one or more topics and specify the starting position in the topic log to consume data from. They can either read from the latest available offset or begin consuming from a particular offset. Consumers can join a consumer group to consume multiple partitions from the same topic concurrently, providing higher throughput and fault tolerance.

### Producers and Consumers
Producers generate data and publish it to Kafka topics. Consumers read data from topics and process it according to their needs. Producers can send data in batches, called records, for efficiency reasons. Each record consists of a key, value, and optional headers. The value field contains the actual data, while the key and headers can be used for metadata or additional attributes about the record.

Producers create one or more threads for sending records asynchronously. The batch size controls the maximum number of records sent in a single request, while buffer memory specifies how much data the producer can hold waiting to be sent. Larger batches reduce overhead and improve throughput, but increase the risk of losing data if the producer crashes prior to transmitting all records in the batch.

Consumers create one or more threads for receiving records. The poll timeout controls how frequently the consumer blocks and waits for records to become available. The max.poll.records setting limits the maximum number of records returned by the server per call to the fetch API, preventing excessively large responses from being buffered internally. Large values of max.poll.records can lead to decreased consumer throughput, but increasing them can increase the potential latency between publishing a record and it being consumed.

### State Store
State stores serve two primary roles in Apache Kafka Streams applications:

1. Fault Tolerance: State stores ensure that stateful operations like aggregates and joins are performed correctly even after recovering from failures.
2. Scalability: Stateful operations benefit greatly from partitioning, which distributes workload across multiple nodes and processors. State stores offer easy ways to scale up or down based on demand.

State stores consist of persistent key-value stores that store materialized views of stream processing operations. Every operator maintains its own local copy of the state, which is periodically flushed to a central store for fault tolerance. To manage state stores, Apache Kafka Streams offers built-in APIs for accessing state directly via operators or via connectors that integrate with external databases, key-value stores, and cache services.

### Windowed Aggregation
Windowed aggregation involves aggregating records into windows of time based on certain criteria, such as the length of time or the content of a specific attribute. Windows can be defined based on event time or processing time, and aggregation functions can be applied over each window to produce output results. Common windowed aggregate functions include count, sum, min, max, average, standard deviation, and others. By default, Apache Kafka Streams performs windowed aggregation based on event time, using a tumbling window size of one second.

Tumbling windows split the data into fixed sized, non-overlapping chunks, which represent a period of time. When a new chunk opens, the current window closes and the next window begins. The size of the window determines the frequency at which windows close and the level of detail captured in the aggregated result. Shorter windows capture larger time spans, while longer windows capture smaller time slices with more frequent updates.

Sliding windows work similarly to tumbling windows, except that the width of the window can be adjusted to track recent activity or patterns. Sliding windows can overlap, meaning that one record can belong to multiple windows simultaneously. Finally, session windows maintain sessions of activity during a specified interval, which can be defined dynamically based on user actions or based on predefined rules.

### Join Operation
Join operation combines data from two input streams based on shared keys, commonly known as equijoins. Different from other windowed operations, joins don't necessarily output a fixed-size window; instead, they emit a record whenever a match is found in both inputs. The nature of joins depends on whether the data is time-ordered or event-driven. Time-ordered joins require synchronization of timestamps between inputs, while event-driven joins can operate independently and can tolerate out-of-orderness. Joins can be implemented using inner joins, left outer joins, and full outer joins.

Inner joins select records that exist in both inputs, matching corresponding records based on shared keys. Left outer joins return all records from the left input, along with matching records from the right input, regardless of whether a match exists. Full outer joins combine all records from both inputs, filling in null values for missing matches. Similarly, join operations can use arbitrary conditions based on key values or fields, such as range filters or pattern matches.
