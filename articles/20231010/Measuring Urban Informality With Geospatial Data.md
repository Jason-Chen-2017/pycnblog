# 1.背景介绍


Urban informality is the consequence of increasing urbanization and a complex city structure that impedes the flow of people’s daily activities into an area characterized by public spaces and common amenities such as schools, libraries, parks, and transit systems. While it has been widely studied in various disciplines, its relationship with geospatial data remains elusive due to several challenges including ambiguity, noise, missing values, and spatial complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for measuring urban informality based on the use of geographic information system (GIS) technologies. Our approach involves identifying informal features, analyzing their spatiotemporal distribution, and predicting the population density at each location. We test our methodology using two case studies: Lima, Peru and Mumbai, India. The results suggest that our algorithm can accurately identify and quantify informal patterns in different cities while reducing bias caused by incomplete or noisy data. These insights will be helpful for understanding and designing new services and infrastructure, improving regional economic development, and supporting city-based decision making.

We start by defining some key concepts related to the problem of measuring urban informality using GIS.

**Spatial Information:** Spatial information refers to the representation of space through points, lines, polygons, and networks. It includes both vector and raster formats and is often used to model urban structures, transportation routes, social interactions, and many other aspects of real-world environments. 

**Geospatial Data:** Geospatial data refers to any type of spatial data that provides information about the position, shape, and attributes of physical phenomena or entities, usually represented on a map or globe. Geospatial data typically consists of three main components: geometries, attributes, and spatial references. Geometries represent the positions and shapes of objects such as buildings, roads, or trees; attributes describe these objects, such as height, material, or age; and spatial references specify where the data was collected, such as coordinates from GPS devices or addresses from street maps. 

**Informal Features:** An informal feature is anything within a given area that reduces traffic flow and promotes social interaction, but does not directly affect residents' quality of life. This could include parks, recreational areas, streets without sidewalks, gardens, playgrounds, and shopping malls. 

**Informality Index:** The informality index is a metric that measures how informal a particular location is. It ranges between zero and one, with higher values indicating more informal conditions. It is computed using a combination of spatial analysis techniques such as clustering, density estimation, and graph theory algorithms applied to the location's point cloud. 

The relationships between these concepts are shown below:

To measure the informality level in a city, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Identifying informal features
2. Analyzing their spatiotemporal distribution
3. Predicting the population density at each location

Let us now proceed to explain each step in detail. 

1. Identifying informal features 
The first step is to identify informal features within the city. To do so, we can leverage GIS tools like QGIS and ArcMap to manually inspect the landuse layers, road networks, building footprints, and other relevant datasets. Once we have identified candidate locations for informal features, we can extract them as polygon boundaries and generate a heat map showing their frequency over time. Alternatively, we can use machine learning algorithms like DBSCAN to automatically detect clusters of similarly labeled pixels in satellite images. However, keep in mind that accurate identification of informal features requires careful examination of multiple factors, such as scale, aspect ratio, elevation, and orientation, which may not always be apparent from surface data alone. Nevertheless, manual inspection and visualizations provide a quick way to get started.

2. Analyzing their spatiotemporal distribution
Once we have identified potential informal locations, we need to analyze their spatiotemporal distributions. One popular method for this is to compute descriptive statistics, such as mean center location, variance, range, and interquartile range, for every point or pixel in the dataset. Descriptive statistics allow us to understand the basic geometry and distribution of informal features across space and time. We can then visualize these statistics in order to uncover patterns and trends that might help identify groups of informal features. For example, if there are dense clusters of informal features centered around specific times of day, we might hypothesize that those areas are experiencing seasonal changes in informality levels. If there are large variations in density or distance to nearby major roads, we might hypothesize that these areas are suffering from congestion issues. Finally, we should also consider the possibility of missing or erroneous data, such as due to sparse coverage or limited accuracy of sensors.

3. Predicting the population density at each location
Finally, once we have analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of informal features, we can predict the population density at each location based on historical demographics and socioeconomic factors. We can train regression models or neural networks to estimate the logarithm of the estimated population density per square kilometer using features extracted from the census or other sources. Since population densities vary strongly depending on contextual factors such as income, education levels, race, gender, and age, it is important to carefully select and interpret the most appropriate predictor variables. Additionally, we must account for the spatial heterogeneity of the demographics and environmental factors in different parts of the city, and ensure that we balance the importance of local and global effects when modeling informality.
