# 1.背景介绍


对于企业级应用开发来说，跨平台特性一直是一个亟待解决的问题。虽然早期硬件厂商针对不同的操作系统发布了同一个软件，但随着移动互联网的兴起、云计算的崛起、大数据时代的到来，不同的操作系统和设备平台之间的差异越来越小，软件的兼容性将越来越弱，更不能满足不同终端客户的需求。因此，企业应用开发需要考虑不同终端设备及平台的兼容性，并提升用户体验。一般而言，企业应用需要具有以下五个特征：

1. 快速响应：即时反应能力强、响应速度快的应用能够提升用户的体验。在移动互联网时代，应用的反应速度必然成为用户的一大挑战。

2. 轻量化：内存占用低、耗电低的应用能够减少系统资源开销。在资源有限的嵌入式系统中尤其适用。

3. 可定制：用户可以根据自身的需求进行定制，从而实现个性化服务。

4. 安全：应用提供的功能要经过严格的审计和测试保证其安全性。

5. 免费：应用应当可以让用户无需付费即可获得。由于收费应用带来的巨额投入成本，许多企业会选择向第三方开发者出售其核心业务功能的软件许可证，以降低企业内部的成本支出。

为了应对上述 challenges ， 目前市面上有一些很优秀的跨平台框架和工具。例如，Cordova（PhoneGap 的前身）就是一个基于 HTML、CSS 和 JavaScript 的移动开发框架，它允许开发人员使用 JavaScript、CSS、XML 来构建移动应用程序，并通过 Apache Cordova 框架运行于多个平台（iOS、Android、Windows Phone、Firefox OS）。它的优点是支持插件机制，可方便地集成第三方库和模块，同时支持本地存储、网络请求等高级功能。另外，React Native （Facebook 推出的移动跨平台 UI 框架）则支持跨平台开发 iOS、Android、Web 三大主流平台，拥有很大的社区支持。

除此之外，还有很多其他优秀的跨平台框架或工具。如 Xamarin、React-Native、Apache Cordova 等等。这些框架或工具都拥有广泛的第三方库生态系统，可以简化开发复杂度并提升效率。并且，它们还可以在运行时调整平台的特性，使得应用具有针对性和定制性。

综上所述，基于跨平台开发的各类框架和工具的出现，使得企业应用开发具备了更高的灵活性、易用性、扩展性、性能和安全性。通过广泛的第三方库生态系统，可以帮助开发者快速开发出精美且功能丰富的应用。

# 2. Core concepts and relationships
Cross-platform frameworks have come up with various approaches in terms of how they deal with platform specific features or behaviors. Some common core concepts and relationships among them are:

## 1. Capabilities
The primary capability of most cross-platform framework is the ability to provide access to underlying platform's native functionality through its APIs. This includes device information, location services, storage management, networking capabilities, etc. Platform specific modules can be accessed using these APIs which enables developers to write platform independent code. For example, when building an application for both Android and iOS platforms, we can use their respective SDKs to take advantage of their unique functionalities such as push notifications, camera, microphone, accelerometer, etc. Cross-platform frameworks also enable developers to reuse code across multiple platforms by creating platform specific implementations. These implementation files typically reside within the source tree under each target platform directory. However, note that not all platforms may support every feature provided by the underlying platform API so there will always be some limitations. In cases where required functionality is missing, developers can fall back on lower level system calls or custom implementations to achieve similar results.

## 2. Ecosystem of Third Party Libraries
Many cross-platform frameworks include an extensive ecosystem of third party libraries or modules which can be used to add additional functionality beyond those provided by the underlying platform APIs. These libraries can range from simple utility functions like date formatting utilities to complex business logic libraries such as database connectivity, web service integration, machine learning algorithms, geolocation tools, payment gateways, social media integrations, etc. The size and quality of this library ecosystem is significant and continues to expand at an increasing rate. Developers often choose these libraries based on their familiarity and relevance to their project. Some popular choices include jQuery Mobile (for mobile web development), BackboneJS (for client side MVC apps), Google Maps API (for maps and location related functionality) etc. These libraries help developers build faster, more efficient and better performing applications than developing everything from scratch.

## 3. Module Bundlers/Compilers
Some cross-platform frameworks bundle multiple platform specific modules together into a single package. This process is known as module bundling or compiling. The output of this compilation process is typically a native executable file or an APK for Android devices, an IPA for iOS devices, etc. The resulting packages can be distributed to app stores or installed directly onto end user devices. The bundling step allows developers to easily combine multiple platform specific modules without having to worry about platform specific details. There are many different module bundler/compilers available depending on the platform being targeted. Popular ones include Browserify (for front-end JavaScript projects) and Titanium (for mobile app development).

## 4. Plugins
Cross-platform frameworks allow developers to extend or modify the behavior of existing built-in modules using plugins. Plugins are standalone components that can be loaded dynamically during runtime and executed on top of the standard platform functionality. They can expose new methods or override existing methods of the original module providing enhanced or customized functionality. Plugins can be written using any language supported by the framework but must conform to a specific interface definition defined by the framework itself. Examples of commonly used plugins include barcode scanner, photo gallery picker, camera preview customization, etc. Depending on the platform, plugins can either be precompiled and included in the final package or downloaded and activated on demand.

## 5. Debugging Tools and Techniques
Debugging issues with cross-platform applications requires special attention due to differences between platforms. Even though tools and techniques vary widely, some general principles remain constant. Here are few tips:

* Use proper logging mechanisms to capture error messages, exceptions, and other relevant information. Different platforms may log errors differently so debugging becomes more challenging even if you understand the logs correctly. Look out for unusual patterns or abnormal behaviors while testing your application.

* Enable remote debug mode on the devices you are testing. With this enabled, you can remotely debug your application running on actual hardware. You would need appropriate debugging tools and setup instructions from the manufacturer of the device.

* Try turning off ad blockers, browser extensions or firewalls while testing your application. Ad blocking software sometimes blocks connections made by certain domains which could interfere with network requests or cause unexpected failures. Other types of interferences can also occur because of shared resources or environmental factors. It is important to isolate the issue to determine if it is caused by the platform or the framework.

* Test on real devices rather than emulators. Emulator performance is limited and may produce inconsistent results compared to physical devices. Additionally, emulated devices may exhibit different behaviors compared to real devices hence causing issues that only manifest themselves on real devices.

Overall, cross-platform frameworks offer several powerful features and options that should help developers quickly create high quality applications that work seamlessly on multiple platforms.
