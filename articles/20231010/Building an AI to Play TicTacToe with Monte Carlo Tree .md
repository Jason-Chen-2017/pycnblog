# 1.背景介绍


## What is the game of tic-tac-toe?
The game of tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a two player strategy board game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a three by three grid. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all squares are filled and neither player has won, then it's called a tie. 

There are many variations on this theme but the most common one is played by two opponents against each other. Each player starts with their symbol placed in one corner of the grid and alternates between moving and filling empty squares until they win or tie. Here is how to play:

1. Players choose symbols (X or O). 

2. Player 1 (X) goes first and chooses a free square on the board. It can either mark the space directly or place it in a pattern where there already exists three marks from that player's previous move. 

3. After Player 1 makes their turn, Player 2 moves and takes the same free square or plays a pattern if possible. This continues until someone wins or the game ends in a draw.


## Monte Carlo Tree Search
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a type of Reinforcement Learning algorithm used for playing games such as chess, Go, and tic-tac-toe. MCTS works by building a tree of possible game states, evaluating these states based on the outcome, selecting the best state(s), expanding those nodes into new child nodes, repeating the process, and eventually finding the optimal policy. 

In tic-tac-toe, we start at the root node and explore the different options available to us by taking actions at each leaf node. At each step, we keep track of which cells have been taken and which haven't. We continue until we reach a terminal state (win, lose, tie), keeping track of the number of times each cell was visited during our search. Once we've completed several simulations, we use this information to calculate the probability distribution over the next action, weighted by how often each option was selected. Then we select the highest scoring option as our move. 

Here is a high level overview of the steps involved in MCTS when playing tic-tac-toe:

1. Start at the root node and randomly select a starting position. 
2. Expand the current node by adding all legal successor positions to the tree.
3. Simulate each position by performing random actions until reaching a terminal state. Keep track of the total reward gained for each player in each simulation.
4. Update the statistics of each node using the results of the simulation.
5. Select a move according to the simulated probabilities.

Let's now dive deeper into the details of implementing MCTS to play tic-tac-toe. I will assume you're familiar with Python programming language and some basic concepts like lists, dictionaries, classes, objects, methods etc., but not necessarily reinforcement learning. 

# 2. Core Concepts and Relationship
## Node Selection
Firstly, we need to define what constitutes a 'node' in the MCTS tree. In this case, a node represents a single position on the tic-tac-toe board. A valid position must satisfy certain conditions before it becomes a node in the tree - it cannot be a terminal state (i.e. someone has won or it's a tie), it must still have blank cells left to fill, and its value should be computed using minimax or another evaluation function (we'll get back to this later).

After we create our initial set of nodes, we perform exploration by choosing nodes randomly and exploring them to find out more about their potential outcomes. Specifically, we simulate the game by making moves randomly and counting the rewards achieved by both players. During this simulation, we also update the visit count and scores for each node accordingly.

When we want to make a decision based on the values calculated so far, we look for the node with the highest score among the unexplored children of the current node. This node becomes the parent of a new node created for the chosen action, and we repeat the above steps recursively to explore the new subtree further. When we reach a terminal state, we propagate the result up the tree towards the root, updating the counts of visits and scores along the way. Finally, we return the final value estimate for the current position.

This recursive process repeats itself until we reach a sufficient depth limit, determined based on computational resources available, or until we decide to stop exploring. Once stopped, we choose the path leading to the node with the highest expected value, corresponding to the move we should make at that point in time.


## Evaluation Function
The second concept we need to understand is the evaluation function. Unlike regular minimax algorithms, MCTS does not evaluate every position completely randomly. Instead, it evaluates only the "interesting" positions encountered while exploring the tree. To achieve this effect, we introduce an evaluation function that assigns a numerical rating to each position based on the likelihood of achieving a winning or losing ending. Common evaluations include:

1. Minimax: Assigns a score to a position based on whether the maximum possible utility is obtained for either player in that position, assuming perfect play by both players.

2. Alpha-Beta pruning: This technique reduces the size of the search tree by ignoring subtrees whose potential benefits exceed a given threshold. This helps prune away branches that cannot improve the overall outcome, reducing computation time and preventing the tree from becoming too deep.

3. Progressive widening: Also referred to as "iterative deepening", this technique extends the search depth gradually, attempting to find better move choices at each step. By doing this, it explores more deeply into areas that seem promising initially, without missing any good options early on.

Once we know the likelihood of victory for each position, we can assign higher weights to positions that have a lower risk of being a bad choice than ones that appear to offer significant advantage. For example, we may assign a higher weight to positions that have a larger number of legal moves remaining, since it would be better to avoid getting stuck in local maxima than to repeatedly choose poor moves due to the uncertainty around the current position. Similarly, we might prefer positions near the middle of the board, as it provides a stronger chance of containing a large portion of the required pieces ahead of time.

Ultimately, we want to balance exploration (looking for new paths through the tree) with exploitation (choosing existing paths that seem likely to lead to a better outcome), depending on the degree of knowledge we have of the environment and the current status of the tree. One approach to do this is to use a combination of the UCB1 formula and progressive widening.

For our purposes, we'll stick to a simple heuristic-based evaluation function that simply checks if there are any immediate winners or losers available in each position, accounting for symmetries. However, we'll leave room for experimentation with more sophisticated approaches in future projects.

## Move Ordering
The third core concept is move ordering. As we build the tree of possible game states, we must ensure that we always choose moves that seem to be highly valuable first. Since tic-tac-toe is a zero-sum game, we don't care if we end up winning or losing the game; we just want to maximise the utility of each individual player. Therefore, the order in which we consider moves doesn't matter very much.

However, we could potentially optimize the tree generation by prioritizing specific moves earlier in the sequence. For instance, we might try to arrange patterns that result in a quick win, instead of waiting for the computer to come up with the optimal set of moves in the beginning. These strategies can sometimes work well, especially for human vs. machine games or games with a small number of distinct patterns.

# 3. Algorithm Details and Math Model 
## Overview
Now let's discuss the actual implementation details and math behind the MCTS algorithm used to play tic-tac-toe. Our aim is to implement an agent that learns to play tic-tac-toe autonomously and automatically, similar to how humans learn and improve over time.

We begin by defining our class structure for representing the game board, nodes in the MCTS tree, and our agent. We represent the game board as a list of strings, with X and O represented by 'x' and 'o', respectively. Nodes are instances of the `TreeNode` class, which contains information about a particular board position, including its state (whether it's occupied, empty, or open for expansion), its parent node, its children, and various statistical metrics collected during the course of the search. We represent our agent as an instance of the `MCTSAgent` class, which inherits from `object`, has a method `make_move()` that returns a recommended move given a game state, and a method `_search()` that performs the MCTS search and returns the best move found.

Next, we will go over the main functions in our `MCTSAgent` class, namely `__init__()`, `reset()`, `set_start_state()`, `expand_tree()`, `select_leaf_node()`, `simulate()`, `backpropagation()`, and `best_child()`. We will also explain the mathematical model behind the MCTS algorithm and show how we apply it to tic-tac-toe.  

Finally, we will demonstrate the working of our agent by creating a simple training loop that generates self-play games and updates the parameters of the neural network periodically based on the performance of the agent.
