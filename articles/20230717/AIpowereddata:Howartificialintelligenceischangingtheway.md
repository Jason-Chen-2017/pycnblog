## 2.基本概念术语说明
Before diving into the main content of this article, let's first understand some basic concepts and terminologies used in data analysis. This would enable us to better grasp the main ideas discussed below. Here are some key terms: 

1. Data: A set of facts about something, people, places, etc., usually in tabular format. Eg: Contact list of customers from a company.

2. Labeling System: An automated system that assigns appropriate labels or tags to data based on predefined criteria. This helps identify patterns, trends, relationships among different datasets. Eg: Email spam filter, sentiment analysis tool.

3. Recommendation Engine: An AI powered application that suggests products or services based on customer preferences and history. It recommends relevant items to users without being asked directly by them. Eg: Amazon Prime, Netflix recommendations.

4. Chatbot: A conversational agent programmed to simulate an actual human conversation, often using natural language processing techniques. These bots provide instant responses to user queries while also handling complex conversations. Eg: Siri, Google Assistant.

5. Algorithm: A step-by-step procedure or mathematical formula used to solve a problem or perform a task. Almost all data analysis algorithms involve numerical computations. Eg: K-means clustering algorithm, decision trees algorithm.

6. Cloud Computing: A type of computing service provided over the internet by third parties. It allows organizations to store, manage, and process large volumes of data remotely, making it easier to access, share, and analyze data. Eg: Microsoft Azure, AWS.

7. Big Data Analytics: The use of advanced data mining and machine learning algorithms to analyze enormous amounts of data stored in distributed databases. Eg: Apache Hadoop, MapReduce framework.

Now that we've got a clear understanding of some important concepts, let's move on to talk about how AI powerd data analysis has transformed the way we analyze data.

# 3.为什么要用人工智能(AI)驱动的数据分析？
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to machines that mimic human intelligence and learn from experience to make predictions, decisions, or behaviors. With the development of new technologies, such as deep learning models, self-learning algorithms, and big data analytics, artificial intelligence is transforming many areas of our lives, including healthcare, finance, transportation, e-commerce, and education. One of the most significant applications of artificial intelligence in data analysis is using its capabilities to automate business processes and improve accuracy.

Traditionally, businesses rely heavily on manual processes for collecting and analyzing data. However, the volume of data generated today requires expertise in multi-faceted fields such as statistics, mathematics, programming languages, database management, and visualization. Moreover, gathering accurate, comprehensive, and timely data poses additional challenges, particularly when dealing with high-velocity data streams such as those coming from IoT devices. Thus, the demand for automated solutions emerges.

Using AI-powered data analysis, companies can achieve much faster and better results. For instance, they can reduce costs, increase profits, and boost competitiveness by identifying patterns and correlations within their data sources. Furthermore, these tools can offer guidance on how to act effectively to maximize profitability, such as prioritizing resources or optimizing inventory levels.

In summary, using AI-powered data analysis empowers businesses to collect, clean, organize, analyze, and interpret data more quickly and accurately. By leveraging AI algorithms, businesses can obtain valuable insights and make smarter business decisions that affect the bottom line.
