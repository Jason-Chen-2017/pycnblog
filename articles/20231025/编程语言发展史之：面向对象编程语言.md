# 1.背景介绍


在上个世纪90年代，程序设计领域的一项重要革命即从过程化到面向对象的编程思想演变而来。面向对象编程(Object-Oriented Programming，简称OOP)把程序分成一个个对象并通过类和继承关系来组织这些对象。OOP赋予程序开发者更高的灵活性、可重用性、可维护性等优点。它极大的促进了计算机程序的可扩展性和健壮性，而且可以使程序编写变得更加简单、易读。1995年，美国计算机科学教授吉姆·范伟克首次提出OOP理论，形成“类、对象、消息”三个基本概念。后来许多计算机相关的行业领导者接受了这一理念，并试图推广这种编程方法。到20世纪中叶，OOP已经成为影响深远的编程方法论，已经成为主流的程序设计思维模式。
面向对象编程语言也经历了多个阶段，如 Smalltalk、C++、Java、Python等。他们都有自己的特点和优点，但总体来说，它们的共同特征是支持抽象、封装、继承、多态等概念，使用类作为程序的基本单位。由于各个编程语言之间存在一定差异，所以理解不同编程语言之间的区别及联系是非常关键的。以下内容主要涉及几种常用的面向对象编程语言，包括Smalltalk、C++、Java、Python。
# 2.Core Concepts and Relationships
## 2.1 Smalltalk
### 2.1.1 Introduction to Smalltalk
Smalltalk是一种纯粹的面向对象编程语言，其采用动态类型系统。Smalltalk源于1976年发明的一个基于消息传递机制的动态面向对象编程环境，由丹尼斯·卡尔斯基（Dennis Carli）、迈克尔·艾伦（Michael Ehrlich）、罗伊德·伍德沃特金（Roy Woodward Jones）创立。它的目标就是创建一个全新的编程环境，可以很好地实现面向对象编程的方法论。然而，实际上Smalltalk是在一个高度可移植的系统上运行的解释型语言。因此，它的程序不能像编译型语言那样直接运行在机器上。但由于Smalltalk的解释器可以在任何平台上运行，并且提供了一个高效的虚拟机来执行程序，使得它的应用十分广泛。
### 2.1.2 Object-oriented programming terminology
#### Class
In Smalltalk, a class is an abstraction that defines the behavior of objects. A class can have instance variables (data members), methods (operations), and superclasses (other classes from which it inherits). A class is defined using the keyword `class` followed by its name and its superclass:

```smalltalk
Class {
  #name : 'MyClass',
  #superclass : 'Object',
  #instVars : [ ],
  #category : 'MyCategory' }
```

#### Instance variable
An instance variable is a named slot within an object that stores some data specific to each object created from the same class. They are declared in the `#instVars` list of a class definition. For example:

```smalltalk
Class {
  #name : 'Person',
  #superclass : 'Object',
  #instVars : [
    #firstName,
    #lastName ] }
```

This declares two instance variables (`#firstName` and `#lastName`) for objects of the `Person` class. Each person object will have its own values stored here.

#### Method
A method is an operation performed on an object or a message sent to an object. It has a selector and zero or more parameters. The body of a method contains statements that perform operations on the receiver (the object on which the method was called) and any other objects passed as arguments. Methods are defined inside a class definition, like so:

```smalltalk
method1
  "Method comment"
  <docstring>
  | localVar1 localVar2 |
  statement1.
  statement2.
  ^ resultValue
```

Here's what these parts do:

1. `method1`: The selector for this method.
2. `"Method comment"`: An optional comment describing the purpose of this method.
3. `<docstring>`: Optional documentation string containing information about how the method works.
4. `| localVar1 localVar2 |`: Declares one or more local variables for use within the scope of this method.
5. `statement1; statement2`: Zero or more statements executed when the method is invoked.
6. `^ resultValue`: The value returned by this method when it is finished executing. If not specified, the method returns `nil`.

#### Message sending
Message sending refers to sending a message with a particular selector to an object. In Smalltalk, messages are composed of a selector (a symbol representing the name of the method to be invoked) and any number of arguments (values to pass to the method). When a message is sent to an object, the Smalltalk runtime searches for a matching method in the object's class hierarchy and executes it if found. Here's an example of sending a message to a Person object:

```smalltalk
person := Person new.
person firstName: 'John'.
person lastName: 'Doe'.
result := person fullName.  "Executes the #fullName method on the person object."
```

#### Inheritance
Inheritance allows a subclass (i.e., a class that extends another class) to inherit all the properties (instance variables, methods) of its superclass. This makes code reuse easier because a change made to the superclass automatically applies to all subclasses. Subclasses define their superclass using the `#superclass:` directive in their class definition:

```smalltalk
Class {
  #name : 'Employee',
  #superclass : 'Person',
  #instVars : [
    #salary ] }
```

#### Polymorphism
Polymorphism means different objects can respond to the same message differently depending on their type. In Smalltalk, polymorphic behavior occurs whenever multiple methods with the same selector are present in different classes in the inheritance hierarchy. When a message is sent to an object, Smalltalk chooses the most appropriate method based on the dynamic type of the object at run time.

### 2.1.3 Syntax and Semantics
#### Syntax
The syntax of Smalltalk is similar to languages such as Java, C++, Python, and Ruby. One difference is that Smalltalk uses colons (:) instead of equal signs (=) for assignment. Another significant deviation from common practice is the absence of semicolons at the end of statements. Instead, Smalltalk relies heavily on line breaks to indicate where a statement ends. The following is an example of a simple program written in Smalltalk:

```smalltalk
[ :x :y |
  x + y
] valueWithArguments: #(2 3).  "Output: 5"
```

This program creates a block literal using the colon notation (`[... |...]`), takes two arguments (`x` and `y`), adds them together using the addition operator (`+`), then evaluates the block using `valueWithArguments:`, passing in the argument array `(2 3)`. Note that we need to explicitly create blocks using `[... |...]` rather than `{... }` due to the way Smalltalk handles block literals. Also note that we don't include the return value of the block since Smalltalk always returns the last expression evaluated in a method.

#### Evaluation Strategy
Smalltalk uses a just-in-time compilation strategy for evaluation of expressions. This means that expressions are first parsed into a parse tree before they're executed. During parsing, Smalltalk performs various transformations to simplify the code, such as removing redundant parentheses and simplifying arithmetic expressions. After parsing completes, the compiler generates machine code for each expression, which is then interpreted by the virtual machine during execution. Because there are no intermediate steps between parsing and interpretation, debugging programs in Smalltalk becomes much simpler compared to other OOP languages like Java.

#### Dynamic Typing
Smalltalk is dynamically typed, meaning that types are determined at runtime rather than being predefined. This feature allows for greater flexibility in developing software, especially when dealing with complex systems that rely on heterogeneous data structures and interactions. However, it also requires developers to pay close attention to the types of data they work with and may lead to subtle bugs that are difficult to diagnose. Overall, dynamic typing offers many benefits, but it does require careful consideration when working with external code.
