## 2.1 Music Generation Definition

> Music generation refers to the task of generating music based on given input text or other types of data. The generated music should be unique and expressive with different styles and melodies. To provide diverse musical choices and enhance user experience, the system can also apply multiple styles during generation. 

We use generative adversarial networks (GANs) for this purpose. GAN is a type of deep learning architecture that consists of two neural networks: A generator network and a discriminator network. The goal of the generator network is to generate novel examples of desired output. On the other hand, the discriminator network tries to distinguish between real and fake samples, i.e., whether the sample comes from the original training set or not. By repeatedly updating these two networks in a collaborative way, we hope to improve both the quality and diversity of our generated music.


## 2.2 Deep Learning Techniques Used

In order to implement the above concept, several techniques are used. Firstly, we need a dataset containing thousands of songs to train our model. Secondly, we can use recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), or transformers as our primary models. Thirdly, we can apply attention mechanisms like beam search, top-k sampling, or weighted transformer layers to guide the RNN outputs. Finally, we can use transfer learning or domain adaptation methods to further improve performance.

Overall, it's important to note that there still remains many challenges in automatic music generation. For example, we have to ensure the consistency between the generator and discriminator parts of the GAN architecture, which may require careful hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, even though recent advances in machine learning have made significant progress towards more complex tasks like speech recognition and natural language processing, music generation still faces fundamental problems such as how to represent structured and unstructured information while generating music? How do we extract meaningful features that contribute to the overall audio quality of our music compositions? We still need researchers to continue their exploration in these areas.

## 3.1 Music Data Preparation

To start with, we will download a large dataset of MIDI files representing various styles of music. These MIDI files contain standardized score representation of musical content, so we don't need to preprocess them manually before feeding into our models. However, we will need to split each song into individual notes using a MIDI parser library like mido. Here are some steps to prepare the dataset:

1. Download a large dataset of MIDI files representing various styles of music.
2. Parse the MIDI files to obtain a list of extracted pitches, velocities, time stamps, and control signals corresponding to each note played. 
3. Convert the list of notes into an array format where each row represents a note and its attributes, and each column corresponds to one feature value. This step requires preprocessing the raw data by filtering out irrelevant events and normalizing values accordingly.
4. Split the preprocessed dataset into training and validation sets. Use a 90/10 split for the training set and validate against the remaining 10%.
5. Normalize the pitch range to be within a certain octave range to avoid overfitting and increase computational efficiency. Also, center and scale all numerical variables to have zero mean and unit variance.
6. Convert the preprocessed dataset into PyTorch tensors and store them on disk.

## 3.2 Model Architecture

The basic structure of our model involves two main components - the generator and discriminator networks. The generator takes in random noise vectors sampled from a prior distribution, and generates a sequence of musical events conditioned on those inputs. The discriminator takes in sequences of musical events generated by the generator and attempts to discriminate between them and real music coming from the training dataset. During training, we update the weights of the generator network to maximize the log likelihood of fooling the discriminator, and update the weights of the discriminator network to reduce the error rate between its predictions and true labels.

Here are some details about the different components of our model:

### Generator Network

Our generator network consists of three subnetworks: 

1. An initial linear projection layer that maps the latent space vector to a high-dimensional feature space. 
2. A series of RNN cells that produce a sequence of musical events at each time step. In particular, we use LSTM cells here since they can capture long-term dependencies in music and handle sequential data better than vanilla RNNs.
3. Another fully connected layer that produces the final sequence of musical events. Since we want our output to be a continuous representation of sound rather than just a sequence of discrete notes, we pass the output through a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with nonlinear activations before converting it back to MIDI format.

### Discriminator Network

Similar to the generator network, the discriminator network also consists of three subnetworks:

1. An initial linear projection layer that maps the input sequence of musical events to a high-dimensional feature space.
2. A series of CNN layers that analyze the temporal dynamics of the musical events to learn invariant representations.
3. A final binary classification layer that predicts whether the input belongs to the real or fake class.

### Training Procedure

During training, we alternate between updating the parameters of the generator and discriminator networks using mini-batch gradient descent updates. During each iteration of the loop, we randomly sample a batch of music sequences from the preprocessed dataset and perform the following operations:

1. Compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the generator and discriminator networks' weights.
2. Update the weights of the generator and discriminator networks using the calculated gradients.
3. Log the loss values and intermediate results to tensorboard for visualization purposes.

After each epoch of training, we evaluate the performance of our model on a held-out validation set and save the best performing model according to some metric like accuracy or loss.

At inference time, we only need to forward new input noise vectors through the generator network to get new sequences of musical events. We then postprocess the output to convert it back to MIDI format and play it using an appropriate software package like FluidSynth.
