Data quality management (DQM) is a critical process for any organization dealing with sensitive or valuable data. It ensures that the accuracy, completeness, consistency and timeliness of the data are maintained, so that they can be used in various decision-making processes and achieve optimal business results. DQM has been recognized as an essential component to effectively manage organizations' information assets across multiple industries, including retail, finance, healthcare, manufacturing, telecommunications, etc. 

However, many organizations fail to establish DQM processes due to lack of proper planning, budgeting, governance and oversight. In such cases, it becomes challenging to ensure that data quality meets its requirements at scale and drives efficient decision making throughout the enterprise. The challenge further adds to the complexity when implementing DQM strategies within multi-tiered organizations. 

To address these challenges, this article provides a strategic perspective on how DQMs can be established at different levels of an organization's hierarchy. We will also highlight key considerations for effective data quality management, including data profiling, data validation, and testing methods. Finally, we'll explore advanced concepts like automated data quality monitoring systems and self-healing data lakes.

This article serves as a blueprint for organizations who want to implement a comprehensive and holistic approach towards managing their data quality. It outlines best practices for assessing the importance of each dataset, developing a well-defined data catalog, creating data models, and ensuring data traceability. Within these components, we've provided practical steps and examples alongside critical concepts to help you successfully deliver high-quality data products and services.

# 2. Basic Concepts & Terminology
## What is Data Quality Management?
Data quality management is a set of activities designed to maintain the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and timeliness of data. It involves defining policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines for managing data quality within an organization. Its primary goal is to identify and correct inaccuracies, errors, or omissions in the data that could adversely affect downstream processes or consumers. DQM considers the overall integrity and validity of data and strives to ensure that it remains consistent, accurate, complete, and up-to-date over time.

DQM encompasses several key areas, such as data profiling, data validation, data cleaning, and data integration. Each area addresses specific aspects of maintaining data quality, and together they form a holistic view of data quality. Below are some key terms and definitions related to DQM:

1. **Data:** Refers to any collection of facts, figures, or observations that are collected from a source system for analysis. These include structured data such as relational databases, unstructured data such as text files, semi-structured data such as XML documents, and open-ended data such as social media content.

2. **Dataset:** A subset of data generated by a single data source that contains data captured under similar circumstances and represents a meaningful unit of observation. For example, a dataset may contain all customer orders placed during a given month. 

3. **Attribute:** A characteristic or property of an object or entity. Attributes describe what makes an object unique and distinguish it from other objects of the same type. Examples of attributes include name, age, date of birth, gender, and occupation.

4. **Record:** A unit of data consisting of one or more values assigned to one or more attributes. Records define individual entities and relationships between them. An order record might have attributes such as customer ID, product ID, quantity ordered, and total price. 

5. **Primary Key:** A field or set of fields that uniquely identifies a record in a database table. Primary keys typically consist of a combination of one or more attributes and usually represent a natural identifier of records.

6. **Foreign Key:** A field or set of fields in a database table that references the value of a primary key in another table. Foreign keys are used to establish links between tables and enable queries to join data from multiple sources.

7. **Quality Dimension:** An aspect of data quality that measures the degree of deviations observed in a particular attribute, record, or dataset. Common dimensions include accuracy, completeness, consistency, uniformity, and temporal conformance.

8. **Data Model:** A model created to capture and organize knowledge about the domain of interest. It consists of a logical representation of the subject matter being modeled and includes entity types, their attributes, and relationships among them. Entity types define categories of things, while attributes specify properties of those things, and relationships define how entities relate to each other. Data models provide a conceptual framework for structuring data and enabling communication between stakeholders, analysts, and developers alike.

9. **Data Catalog:** A repository of metadata describing datasets, data sources, attributes, quality dimensions, and data owners. This document acts as a centralized location where users can find relevant documentation regarding datasets stored within an organization.

10. **Data Owner:** An individual responsible for the management, maintenance, and development of a certain dataset, which can include individuals, teams, departments, or even entire subdivisions within an organization. They control access to the data, authorize changes, and determine the use restrictions.

11. **Compliance Policy:** A policy that establishes the controls and responsibilities required for meeting compliance goals. Compliance policies often include regulations, guidelines, and standards covering ethical principles, privacy laws, security protocols, and data handling expectations.

# 3. Algorithmic Principles & Techniques
In this section, we'll discuss fundamental algorithms and techniques used in DQM, such as profiling, validation, and cleansing. Profiling involves analyzing existing data to gain insights into its structure, size, and content. Validation involves verifying whether the data matches the expected format and content. Cleansing involves removing invalid or incomplete data from the dataset to improve its quality. Additionally, we'll discuss techniques for identifying duplicates and anomaly detection.

### Data Profiling
Profiling refers to inspecting data to understand its structure, size, and content, without relying solely on technical tools. Profiles typically involve exploratory analysis of raw data using statistical techniques such as descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and visualization. To create a profile, a data scientist should first decide what questions to ask, then select appropriate statistical tests based on those questions, clean and transform the data accordingly, and finally generate visualizations to summarize the results. Here are some common profiling tasks:

1. Understanding the Structure of the Dataset
   - Identify the number of columns, rows, and attributes in the dataset.
   - Check if there are missing or extra values in the data. 
   - Check if there are duplicate or irrelevant rows in the dataset.

2. Quantifying Data Content
   - Determine the frequency distribution of categorical variables.
   - Calculate summary statistics such as mean, median, variance, standard deviation, min/max values, skewness, kurtosis, etc., for continuous variables.
   
3. Correlating Variables
   - Use scatter plots, heat maps, or boxplots to visualize relationships between variables.
   - Identify co-linearities and multicollinearity between variables.
   
4. Detecting Outliers
   - Detect outliers in the data using rules-based approaches or clustering algorithms.
   - Remove outlier points to reduce noise and improve data quality.
   
### Data Validation
Validation involves checking whether the data complies with predefined criteria or constraints before being ingested into a database or analyzed by analytics tools. Validating data ensures that it follows defined rules, conventions, and formats, and reduces risks associated with incorrect data ingestion or processing. Here are some common validation tasks:

1. Formatting Checks
   - Check if the data types match the expected ones.
   - Check if the length and precision of numerical values meet specified limits.
   - Check if date values are properly formatted and conform to ISO 8601 standard.
   
2. Consistency Checks
   - Verify that all data elements within a dataset belong to the same category.
   - Ensure that foreign keys reference valid primary keys.
   
3. Cross-Field Checks
   - Evaluate data consistency across related fields to prevent data entry errors.
   - Implement business logic checks to enforce data quality rules.
   
4. Dependent Variable Checks
   - Test machine learning algorithms on historical data to check for bias, variance, and error rate.
   - Conduct sensitivity analysis to analyze potential impact of input parameters on output variable.
   
### Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is the process of removing erroneous or inconsistent data from a dataset. Cleansed data helps to improve the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and reliability of the underlying data. There are several ways to perform data cleaning, including data warehousing, filtering, imputation, and transformation. The following are commonly performed cleaning operations:

1. Data Warehousing
   - Store cleansed copies of dirty data in separate tables or views, depending on the needs of the application.
   - Enable incremental updates to the cleansed data, rather than updating the original dirty data.
   
2. Filtering
   - Remove irrelevant or incomplete data points using filters such as regular expressions or simple rules.
   - Apply heuristics to automatically detect and remove outliers or rare values.
   
3. Imputing Missing Values
   - Replace missing values with estimates derived from other available data points.
   - Generate synthetic values based on patterns or correlations in the data.
   
4. Transformation
   - Convert data types or structures to match target schemas, reducing storage space and improving efficiency.
   - Normalize data by converting relationships among tables to eliminate redundancy and enforce referential integrity.

### Identifying Duplicates and Anomaly Detection
Duplication occurs when two or more identical or very similar records exist in a dataset. Anomaly detection involves identifying and flagging suspicious or unexpected events or behaviors in the data. Some common techniques for anomaly detection include cluster analysis, autoencoder networks, and principal component analysis. Cluster analysis groups similar records into clusters based on their similarity scores, whereas autoencoders learn to extract features from the data and reconstruct the input signal. Principal component analysis identifies linear combinations of variables that explain most of the variation in the data and projects the data onto a lower-dimensional space.
