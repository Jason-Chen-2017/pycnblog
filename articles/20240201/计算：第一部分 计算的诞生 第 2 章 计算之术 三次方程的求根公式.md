Computation: The Emergence of Calculation - Part I: The Art of Computation - Chapter 2: Cubic Equation Root-Finding Formulas
=======================================================================================================================

Introduction
------------

In this chapter, we will delve into the history and mathematics behind finding the roots of a cubic equation. We will explore the origins of these formulas and their significance in the development of modern computation. Additionally, we will provide practical examples and code snippets to help readers understand how to apply these formulas in real-world scenarios.

Background
----------

The study of algebraic equations has been an essential part of mathematical research for centuries. In particular, the quest to find the roots of polynomial equations has led to significant advancements in the field. One such class of equations is the cubic equation, which can be written as:

$$ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0$$

where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are constants. The challenge lies in finding the roots of this equation, i.e., the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation.

### Historical Context

The first systematic treatment of cubic equations was developed by the Italian mathematician Scipione del Ferro (1465–1526). His work laid the foundation for subsequent discoveries by other mathematicians, including Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia (1499/1500–1557) and Gerolamo Cardano (1501–1576), who published their findings in the influential book Ars Magna.

Core Concepts and Connections
-----------------------------

Cubic equations have three roots, which can be real or complex numbers. There are several methods for finding these roots, but in this chapter, we will focus on two classic formulas:

1. **Cardano's Formula**: This formula expresses the roots of a cubic equation using radical expressions involving the coefficients of the equation. It works for any cubic equation, regardless of whether it has rational or irrational roots. However, it may yield complex solutions even when all roots are real.
2. **Naso's Method**: This method is based on the factorization of the cubic polynomial. It requires that the cubic equation satisfies certain conditions, but when applicable, it provides a more straightforward way to obtain real roots.

Cardano's Formula
----------------

To derive Cardano's Formula, we start by transforming the cubic equation into a depressed form:

$$y^3 + py = q$$

where $p = \frac{3ac - b^2}{3a^2}$ and $q = \frac{2b^3 - 9abc + 27a^2d}{27a^3}$.

Now, we can express the roots of the cubic equation using Cardano's Formula:

$$y\_k = -\frac{1}{3}p + 2\sqrt{-\frac{p^3}{27}}\cos\left(\theta\_k + \frac{4k\pi}{3}\right) \quad k = 0, 1, 2$$

with $\theta\_k = \arccos\left(-\frac{q}{2}\sqrt{-\frac{27}{p^3}}\right)$.

Note that we need to convert back to the original variable $x$:

$$x\_k = y\_k - \frac{b}{3a}$$

Naso's Method
-------------

Naso's method applies to cubic equations that can be factored as follows:

$$ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = a(x - r\_1)(x - r\_2)(x - r\_3)$$

where $r\_1$, $r\_2$, and $r\_3$ are the roots of the cubic equation.

If we can identify a value for $t$ such that:

$$at(t^2 + pt + q) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$$

then we can use the following relationships to determine the roots:

$$r\_1 + r\_2 + r\_3 = -b/a$$
$$r\_1r\_2 + r\_1r\_3 + r\_2r\_3 = c/a$$
$$r\_1r\_2r\_3 = -d/a$$

Best Practices and Code Examples
---------------------------------

Let us consider a concrete example of a cubic equation:

$$2x^3 - 8x^2 + 8x - 2 = 0$$

Using Python, we can implement Cardano's and Naso's methods as follows:

```python
import math

def cardano(a, b, c, d):
   p = (3 * a * c - b**2) / (3 * a**2)
   q = (2 * b**3 - 9 * a * b * c + 27 * a**2 * d) / (27 * a**3)
   theta = math.acos(-q / (2 * math.sqrt(-p**3 / 27)))
   return [
       -p / 3 + 2 * (-p**3 / 27)**0.5 * math.cos(theta + 2 * k * math.pi / 3) - b / (3 * a)
       for k in range(3)
   ]

def naso(a, b, c, d):
   t = (b**2 - 3 * a * c) / (9 * a) + (b * (2 * b**2 - 9 * a * c) + 27 * a**2 * d) ** 0.5 / (
       27 * a**2
   )
   if t == 0:
       raise ValueError("Cannot apply Naso's method")
   s = (3 * a * d - b * c**2) / (a * t**3)
   t = -c / (3 * a * t)
   return [t + s / x for x in [1, (-3 + math.sqrt(12)) / 2, (-3 - math.sqrt(12)) / 2]]

print("Cardano's method: ", cardano(2, -8, 8, -2))
print("Naso's method:    ", naso(2, -8, 8, -2))
```

Real-World Applications
-----------------------

These cubic root-finding techniques have applications in various fields, including physics, engineering, computer graphics, and finance. For instance, they can be used to solve problems involving celestial mechanics, fluid dynamics, or financial modeling.

Conclusion
----------

Understanding the historical development of algebraic equation solving has provided valuable insights into modern computation. By studying classic formulas like Cardano's and Naso's methods for finding the roots of cubic equations, we gain a deeper appreciation for the mathematical foundations upon which modern computer algorithms are built. As technology continues to advance, it is essential to maintain this connection between the past and future of our field.

Appendix: Common Questions and Answers
-------------------------------------

**Q:** Why do some methods yield complex solutions even when all roots are real?

**A:** This phenomenon arises because certain mathematical expressions can represent both real and complex numbers, depending on the values of their variables. In these cases, complex solutions may emerge during the calculation process, only to cancel out later, resulting in real roots.

**Q:** Are there more efficient methods than those presented here for solving cubic equations with specific properties?

**A:** Yes, there are alternative methods tailored to particular types of cubic equations. However, the two methods discussed in this chapter are general enough to cover most cases.

**Q:** How do these techniques compare to numerical methods for solving polynomial equations?

**A:** Numerical methods, such as the Newton-Raphson method, can often provide faster and more accurate results for finding the roots of polynomial equations. However, they lack the elegance and historical significance of the classic formulas presented here.
