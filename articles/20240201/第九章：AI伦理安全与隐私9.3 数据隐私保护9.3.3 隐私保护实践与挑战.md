AI Ethics, Security and Privacy - AI Privacy Protection: Practices and Challenges (9.3.3)
=============================================================================

*Background Introduction*
------------------------

In the era of big data and artificial intelligence (AI), data privacy has become a critical concern for individuals, organizations, and governments. With the rapid development of AI technologies, personal data is being collected, processed, and analyzed at an unprecedented scale. While AI can bring tremendous benefits to society, it also poses significant risks to individual privacy and autonomy. Therefore, protecting data privacy in AI systems has become an essential task for AI researchers, developers, and practitioners.

*Core Concepts and Relationships*
----------------------------------

Data privacy refers to the rights and interests of individuals in controlling the collection, use, and dissemination of their personal information. In AI systems, data privacy involves various technical, legal, ethical, and social issues related to the design, deployment, and operation of AI algorithms, models, and applications. Specifically, data privacy protection aims to ensure that AI systems respect individuals' privacy preferences, avoid unauthorized access, disclosure, or usage of personal data, and provide transparency, accountability, and fairness in AI decision-making processes.

To achieve these goals, AI privacy protection relies on several core concepts and techniques, such as:

* Data minimization: collecting and processing only the necessary data for achieving specific AI tasks.
* Differential privacy: adding controlled noise to statistical queries to protect the privacy of individual records while preserving the utility of aggregate data.
* Secure multi-party computation: enabling multiple parties to perform joint computations on their private data without revealing their inputs.
* Federated learning: training AI models on decentralized data distributed across multiple devices or servers while keeping the raw data local.
* Homomorphic encryption: performing computations on encrypted data without decrypting it.

These concepts and techniques are interrelated and often combined to provide more robust and flexible privacy protection solutions for AI systems.

*Algorithm Principles, Operations, and Mathematical Models*
----------------------------------------------------------

In this section, we will introduce the principles, operations, and mathematical models of the core AI privacy protection techniques mentioned above.

### Data Minimization

Data minimization is a principle that advocates collecting and processing only the necessary data for achieving specific AI tasks. It aims to reduce the risk of privacy breaches and violations by limiting the amount and scope of personal data used in AI systems. The main steps of data minimization include:

1. Identifying the minimum dataset required for achieving the AI task.
2. Collecting and processing only the identified data items.
3. Avoiding unnecessary data sharing or storage.
4. Applying data retention policies to delete or anonymize the data when it is no longer needed.

The data minimization principle can be formalized as follows:

$$
\text{Minimize}(D) = \text{argmin}_{D'} |D'|, \text{subject to } f(D') = f(D)
$$

where $D$ represents the original dataset, $D'$ denotes the reduced dataset, and $f$ is the AI function that maps the dataset to the output.

### Differential Privacy

Differential privacy is a technique that adds controlled noise to statistical queries to protect the privacy of individual records while preserving the utility of aggregate data. It ensures that the presence or absence of any individual record does not significantly affect the query results. The main steps of differential privacy include:

1. Defining the query function $q$ that maps the dataset to the query result.
2. Adding controlled noise $\epsilon$ to the query function to obtain the differentially private query function $q_\epsilon$.
3. Evaluating the query function $q_\epsilon(D)$ on the dataset $D$.

The differential privacy guarantee can be formalized as follows:

$$
\Pr[q_\epsilon(D) \in S] \leq e^\epsilon \Pr[q_\epsilon(D') \in S], \forall S \subseteq \text{Range}(q), \forall D, D' \text{ differing on one element}
$$

where $S$ represents the set of possible query results, $\text{Range}(q)$ denotes the range of the query function, and $D, D'$ are two neighboring datasets that differ by one element.

### Secure Multi-Party Computation

Secure multi-party computation (SMPC) is a technique that enables multiple parties to perform joint computations on their private data without revealing their inputs. It uses cryptographic protocols to securely exchange and process the private data while ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The main steps of SMPC include:

1. Defining the joint function $f$ that maps the private inputs of multiple parties to the output.
2. Designing the SMPC protocol that securely computes the function $f$ using cryptographic techniques such as homomorphic encryption, secret sharing, and oblivious transfer.
3. Executing the SMPC protocol among the participating parties.

The SMPC guarantee can be formalized as follows:

$$
\text{Output}(f(\text{PrivateInput}_1, \text{PrivateInput}_2, ..., \text{PrivateInput}_n)) = f(\text{PublicInput}_1, \text{PublicInput}_2, ..., \text{PublicInput}_n)
$$

where $\text{PrivateInput}_i$ represents the private input of party $i$, $\text{PublicInput}_i$ denotes the public input of party $i$, and $\text{Output}$ refers to the final output of the joint function $f$.

### Federated Learning

Federated learning is a technique that trains AI models on decentralized data distributed across multiple devices or servers while keeping the raw data local. It enables collaborative learning and knowledge sharing among multiple parties without compromising data privacy and security. The main steps of federated learning include:

1. Defining the AI model architecture and the loss function.
2. Distributing the AI model to multiple devices or servers.
3. Training the AI model on local data and sending the gradients or updates to a central server.
4. Aggregating the gradients or updates from multiple devices or servers to update the global AI model.
5. Repeating the training and aggregation process until convergence.

The federated learning guarantee can be formalized as follows:

$$
\text{GlobalModel} = \text{Aggregate}(\text{LocalModel}_1, \text{LocalModel}_2, ..., \text{LocalModel}_n)
$$

where $\text{LocalModel}_i$ represents the local AI model trained on device or server $i$, and $\text{GlobalModel}$ denotes the final aggregated AI model.

### Homomorphic Encryption

Homomorphic encryption is a technique that performs computations on encrypted data without decrypting it. It enables privacy-preserving data processing and analysis in various applications, such as cloud computing, blockchain, and IoT. The main steps of homomorphic encryption include:

1. Encoding the plaintext data into ciphertext using a homomorphic encryption scheme.
2. Performing the desired computations on the ciphertext.
3. Decoding the ciphertext back into plaintext using the same homomorphic encryption scheme.

The homomorphic encryption guarantee can be formalized as follows:

$$
\text{Decrypt}(E(\text{Plaintext})) = f(\text{Plaintext})
$$

where $E$ represents the homomorphic encryption function, $\text{Plaintext}$ denotes the original data, and $f$ is the desired computation function.

*Best Practices: Codes and Explanations*
----------------------------------------

In this section, we will provide some best practices for implementing AI privacy protection techniques with code examples and explanations.

### Data Minimization

To implement data minimization in Python, you can use the following steps:

1. Identify the minimum dataset required for achieving the AI task. For example, if you want to predict house prices based on location, size, and age, you only need these three features.
```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv('house_prices.csv')
minimal_data = data[['location', 'size', 'age']]
```
2. Collect and process only the identified data items. You can drop or ignore the unnecessary columns or rows.
```python
minimal_data.dropna(inplace=True)  # drop missing values
```
3. Avoid unnecessary data sharing or storage. You can use access control, encryption, or anonymization techniques to protect the sensitive data.
```python
minimal_data.to_csv('minimal_data.csv', index=False)  # save minimal data
```

### Differential Privacy

To implement differential privacy in Python, you can use the Google's differential privacy library `google-dp`. Here is an example of adding Laplace noise to a histogram query:

```python
!pip install google-dp

from dp import laplace_mechanism

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # original data
epsilon = 1.0  # privacy budget
delta = 0.1  # failure probability
query_function = lambda d: sum(d) / len(d)  # mean query
privacy_protection = laplace_mechanism(query_function, epsilon, delta)
result = privacy_protection(data)
print(result)
```

### Secure Multi-Party Computation

To implement secure multi-party computation in Python, you can use the `diffie-hellman-group1-sha1` module from the `cryptography` library to perform key exchange and symmetric encryption using AES algorithm. Here is an example of securely computing the sum of two integers:

```python
!pip install cryptography

from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import diffie_hellman
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import Cipher, algorithms, modes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization

# Generate keys for Alice and Bob
alice_private_key = diffie_hellman.generate_private_key(hashes.SHA256())
bob_private_key = diffie_hellman.generate_private_key(hashes.SHA256())

# Exchange public keys and compute shared secret
alice_public_key = alice_private_key.public_key()
bob_public_key = bob_private_key.public_key()
shared_secret_alice = alice_private_key.exchange(bob_public_key)
shared_secret_bob = bob_private_key.exchange(alice_public_key)
assert shared_secret_alice == shared_secret_bob

# Encrypt and decrypt messages
message = b'hello world'.ljust(32)  # pad message to multiple of 16 bytes
nonce = secrets.token_bytes(16)
algorithm = algorithms.AES(shared_secret_alice[:16])
mode = modes.CTR()
encryptor = Cipher(algorithm, mode, nonce).encryptor()
ciphertext = encryptor.update(message) + encryptor.finalize()
decryptor = Cipher(algorithm, mode, nonce).decryptor()
plaintext = decryptor.update(ciphertext) + decryptor.finalize()
assert plaintext == message

# Compute the sum securely
a = int.from_bytes(alice_private_key.public_key().public_numbers().n, 'big')
b = int.from_bytes(bob_private_key.public_key().public_numbers().n, 'big')
sum = (a + b) % ((1 << 128) - 1)  # assume 128-bit security level
print(sum)
```

### Federated Learning

To implement federated learning in Python, you can use the `tensorflow_federated` library from TensorFlow. Here is an example of training a logistic regression model on decentralized data distributed across two devices:

```python
!pip install tensorflow-federated

import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_federated as tff

# Define the model architecture and loss function
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
   tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(1,))
])
def loss_fn(y_true, y_pred):
   return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))
model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss=loss_fn)

# Create synthetic datasets for two devices
dataset1 = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensors(([1], [1]))
dataset2 = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensors(([2], [0]))
datasets = [dataset1, dataset2]

# Define the federated learning algorithm
def federated_averaging(local_models, local_data):
   def map_fn(x):
       loss, _ = model.evaluate(x, steps=1)
       return {'loss': loss}
   aggregated_metrics = tff.federated_computation(map_fn)(local_models, local_data)
   federated_model = tff.learning.build_federated_averaging_process(
       model,
       client_optimizer_fn=lambda: tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.02),
       server_optimizer_fn=lambda: tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=1.0)
   )
   return federated_model.next(aggregated_metrics)

# Train the model on local datasets
for round_num in range(10):
   local_models, local_metrics = [], []
   for i, dataset in enumerate(datasets):
       model.set_weights(federated_averaging.initialize().run(iter(dataset)))
       for batch in dataset:
           model.train_on_batch(*batch)
       local_models.append(model.get_weights())
       local_metrics.append(model.test_on_batch(*batch)[0])
   federated_averaging.next(local_models, local_metrics)

# Evaluate the final model on centralized test data
test_data = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensors(((0, 1), [0]), ((3, 4), [1]))
model.evaluate(test_data)
```

### Homomorphic Encryption

To implement homomorphic encryption in Python, you can use the `pyfhel` library from Microsoft Research. Here is an example of adding two encrypted integers:

```python
!pip install pyfhel

import pyfhel as paillier

# Generate keys for Alice and Bob
alice_keypair = paillier.new_pubkey(512)
bob_keypair = paillier.new_pubkey(512)

# Encrypt two integers using Alice's public key
encrypted_a = alice_keypair.encrypt(1)
encrypted_b = alice_keypair.encrypt(2)

# Perform homomorphic addition using Bob's private key
result = bob_keypair.add(encrypted_a, encrypted_b)

# Decrypt the result using Alice's private key
decrypted_result = alice_keypair.decrypt(result)
print(decrypted_result)
```

*Appendix: Frequently Asked Questions*
------------------------------------

**Q: What is the difference between data privacy and data security?**

A: Data privacy refers to the rights and interests of individuals in controlling the collection, use, and dissemination of their personal information. Data security refers to the measures and technologies for protecting data from unauthorized access, modification, destruction, or disclosure. While data privacy and data security are related, they are not identical. Data privacy focuses on individual control and autonomy, while data security focuses on technical and organizational safeguards.

**Q: Can AI models learn anything useful from noisy or perturbed data?**

A: Yes, AI models can still learn useful patterns and relationships from noisy or perturbed data, especially if the noise or perturbation is controlled and calibrated. For example, differential privacy adds controlled noise to statistical queries to protect individual privacy while preserving aggregate information. Federated learning trains AI models on decentralized data without sharing raw data, which can reduce the risk of privacy breaches and violations.

**Q: How can we measure the privacy loss or gain of AI models?**

A: There are several metrics for measuring the privacy loss or gain of AI models, such as entropy, mutual information, and divergence. These metrics quantify the amount of uncertainty or leakage of private information in AI models. However, these metrics may not capture all aspects of privacy, such as fairness, accountability, and transparency. Therefore, it is important to develop more holistic and comprehensive privacy evaluation frameworks for AI models.

**Q: Are there any legal or regulatory frameworks for AI privacy protection?**

A: Yes, there are various legal and regulatory frameworks for AI privacy protection, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States, and the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) in China. These frameworks impose obligations and responsibilities on AI developers, providers, and users to protect individuals' privacy rights and interests. However, these frameworks may vary across jurisdictions and sectors, which can create legal and compliance challenges for AI systems.
