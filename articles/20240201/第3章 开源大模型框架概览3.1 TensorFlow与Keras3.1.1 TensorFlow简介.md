3.1 TensorFlow与Keras
=================

TensorFlow是Google开源的一个流行的开源机器学习库。它支持 numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computations to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API.

Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.

We will first introduce TensorFlow and then describe how Keras can be used as a high level API on top of TensorFlow.

### 背景介绍

TensorFlow was originally developed by the Google Brain team for internal use. In November 2
