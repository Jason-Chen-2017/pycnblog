**Explanation:** A responsive design ensures that the product looks and functions well on any device, providing a consistent user experience.

#### 9. User Testing and Feedback

**Question:** What are the key considerations when conducting user testing?

**Answer:** Key considerations include selecting the right participants, defining clear test objectives, preparing test scenarios, and gathering actionable feedback.

**Explanation:** User testing helps designers identify usability issues and validate their assumptions, leading to better design decisions.

#### 10. A/B Testing and Conversion Rate Optimization

**Question:** What is A/B testing, and how can it be used to improve user experience?

**Answer:** A/B testing is a method of comparing two versions of a design or feature to determine which performs better. It helps designers make informed decisions based on real user behavior.

**Explanation:** By testing different design variations, designers can identify the most effective approach and optimize the user experience.
