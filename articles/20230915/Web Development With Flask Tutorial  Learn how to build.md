## What is Flask?
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python and based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions. It was first released on December 17th, 2010 and has become one of the most popular Python frameworks for developing web applications due to its simplicity, flexibility and ease-of-use.

In recent years, Flask has been emerging as the de facto standard for building web applications with Python. Its simplicity, modularity, and object-oriented approach have made it an excellent choice for small-to-medium sized projects that require fast development cycles and can scale up easily later on if needed.

Flask's powerful features include:
- Easy URL routing
- Dynamic request handling
- Integrated template engine (Jinja 2)
- Flexible configuration system
- Good documentation

It also offers a wide range of extensions that provide support for things like database integration, user authentication, caching, etc., making it a robust platform for modern web application development.

Overall, Flask provides everything you need to get started quickly while still giving you enough flexibility to grow your project as your needs change over time. We'll now take a look at what exactly Flask is and how we can use it to create a simple web application.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you should have some knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and basic Python programming concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals, functions, classes, modules and objects. You should also be comfortable working with command line interfaces and text editors such as Notepad or Sublime Text. Finally, you will need to install Python and pip before starting this tutorial. If you don't already have these tools installed, please refer to the official installation instructions available online.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

1. Understand the basics of Flask and the purpose of using it to develop web applications
2. Install Flask on your computer and create a new project
3. Create a simple Flask app that displays "Hello, World!" when visited in a web browser
4. Use Flask routes to handle different URLs and display dynamic content accordingly
5. Define templates within your Flask app to enable reusability across multiple pages
6. Configure Flask settings and integrate common web development libraries like Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-WTF, and Flask-Login
7. Test your Flask app locally using a development server and deploy it to a production environment such as Heroku

This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If not, we recommend checking out tutorials from sites like Codecademy or Mozilla Developer Network.

Before we begin, let's go through a brief overview of Flask terminology.

# 2.Flask Terminology
## Application Factory Pattern
The main pattern used by Flask to organize the code and configure our application is known as the **Application Factory** pattern. This involves creating a factory function which returns our instance of `Flask`. Here's how it works:

1. Import the Flask class from the flask module.
2. Define a factory function which takes optional arguments for configuring our Flask instance.
3. Inside the factory function, initialize all required components such as the debugging mode, secret key, config file path, etc. These configurations may come from environment variables or other sources depending on the requirements of your application.
4. Register blueprints to the Flask instance created inside the factory function. Blueprints are miniature apps that help us modularize our application into smaller pieces. A blueprint can contain any number of views, models, templates, static files, and other resources necessary for that specific functionality. 
5. Return the Flask instance created in the factory function. 

Here's an example implementation of the above pattern:<|im_sep|>
