# 2. Background Introduction
## 2.1 Theory and Concepts in Quantum Mechanics
Quantum mechanics is a subfield of physics that studies the behavior of quantum systems, including atoms and molecules, at the microscopic level by treating them as waves or fields in space and time. The basic unit of quantum mechanics are qubits (quantum bits), which can exist either in superposition or states of pure energy levels. 

In practice, when we perform experiments with nuclear reactors, we usually measure probabilities instead of wave functions directly. Probability distributions are obtained from measurements through random sampling methods such as quantum measurement, statistical analysis, and quasi-Monte Carlo simulations. Here's an outline of some commonly used concepts and quantities related to quantum mechanics:

1. Wave function: The wavefunction $\psi$ is the mathematical representation of the quantum state of a system, and it encodes all possible configurations of its particles. It has two key properties:
    * normalization condition: $\left\langle \psi | \psi \right\rangle = 1$, where $| \psi \rangle$ means the vector representation of the wavefunction. This ensures that the wavefunction always sums up to one for any input configuration. In other words, the probability distribution over all possible outcomes of the experiment must be normalized.
    * positivity constraint: $|\psi|^2\geq 0$. This ensures that the amplitude of each component of the wavefunction is non-negative.
2. Observables: An observable $A$ is a mathematical object that describes how a physical system changes when measured. Examples include position, momentum, spin, angular momentum, charge, and magnetic field. We can calculate the expectation value $\left\langle A \right\rangle$ of an observable using Schroedinger's equation, which relates the wavefunction and its corresponding Hamiltonian operator:

    $$
    \hat{H}\psi(\boldsymbol{x}, t)=i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\psi(\boldsymbol{x},t)\rangle.$$

    For example, the kinetic energy density operator $\hat{T}$ represents the average energy content of the system along the x-direction. The expectation value of $\hat{T}$ is calculated numerically using numerical integration techniques on the wavefunction grid.

3. Sampling: Random sampling refers to obtaining samples from a probability distribution by randomly choosing events according to their probability. There are several ways to sample probabilistic models like quantum mechanics, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and importance sampling. MCMC involves constructing a Markov chain model based on the joint distribution of multiple variables, then simulating the evolution of this chain using stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Importance sampling involves approximating the target distribution with simpler ones, allowing us to draw more accurate samples. 

4. Thermalization: When a system is initially exposed to thermal fluctuations due to temperature variations, the probability distribution of particle positions will exhibit long-range correlations and behave poorly under standard sampling methods. To address this issue, various adaptive sampling algorithms have been proposed, such as metropolis algorithm, simulated tempering, and collective variable Monte Carlo (CVMC). Collective variable theory provides a theoretical foundation for understanding particle dynamics and characterizing coupling between different degrees of freedom.  

5. Quantum computing: Quantum computers rely on the principles of quantum mechanics and information theory to manipulate classical data into quantum states. They use superconducting circuits, phase gadgets, and quantum dots to operate on and store quantum bits. They can process large amounts of data and carry out complex computational tasks using fewer resources than traditional digital computers.

## 2.2 Neutron Transport Calculation Methods
The study of neutron transport in nuclear reactor calculations requires a combination of advanced mathematical methods and simulation tools, particularly in the context of spatial discretization. Some common methods used in the industry include deterministic diffusion, stochastic volatility, path integral, and branching ratio method. Each of these methods addresses specific challenges in calculating neutron fluxes and transmutations in a reactor core. Here's an overview of the fundamental concepts and approaches underlying these calculation methods:

1. Spatial Discretization: Spatial discretization refers to dividing the entire domain of interest into smaller and less-accurate regions, represented by finite elements. These discrete regions are combined together to form a mesh of points or cells within the problem domain. Different discretizations may require varying numbers of dimensions, resolution, and element shapes. 

2. Particle Transport Models: The transport coefficients are determined by solving partial differential equations (PDEs) representing the transport processes occurring during neutron interactions. Popular models include first order approximation (FOAM), Macroscopic Cross Sections (MXS), and full spectral approach (FSA). FOAM assumes linear response coefficients and does not account for heterogeneous cross sections or detailed scattering mechanisms. MXS assumes macroscopic cross section dependence but neglects nuances of real materials and processes. Full Spectral Approach accounts for both macroscopic and microscopic details of material and energy spread, but is computationally expensive and prone to errors caused by truncation effects.

3. Reactor Core Simulation Tools: There are several software packages available for performing neutron transport simulations in a reactor core. Some popular tools include CYCLE, MTCC, ORIGEN, and TRACE. CYCLE uses the Finite Element Method (FEM) to solve fluid flow problems, while ORIGEN uses full spectral approach and specialized radiation damage models to simulate neutron spectra and reactivity decay. Trace uses both continuous-energy and multigroup approach to simulate neutron fluxes. Multigroup approach allows us to handle both fast and thermal neutron precursors simultaneously, whereas the continuous-energy solution handles only fast neutron precursor emission. Other open source codes such as OpenMC and MOOSE provide support for arbitrary geometries and different transport laws.

# 3. WWR Model Overview
## 3.1 What Is WWR Model?
Within neutronics, the weak-width approximation (WWA) or weak-width reference (WWREF) model is often used to describe the neutron spectrum and the effective multiplication factor for activation of spontaneous fission chain reactions. This technique was proposed by Jackson et al. [Jac1998] and explored extensively since then by many authors who applied it to a variety of problems in the field.

The idea behind the WWR model is simple. One sees that most fissile nuclides have small atomic masses compared to their atomic number ($m_A >> Z$). Accordingly, neutrons do not travel very far before interacting with the fission products produced by these nuclides. Consequently, the prompt neutron emission rate should be much higher than what would otherwise be predicted by the ordinary capture-reaction mechanism. Therefore, the dominant contribution to the neutron absorption rate must come from intrinsic scattering rather than from capture and loss of the electron. Intrinsic scattering depends on the shape of the free gas surrounding the reaction site, which can be accurately modeled by a wide range of continuum expressions. By comparing the actual experimental results to the predictions of the WWR model, researchers can gain insights into the mechanism responsible for accelerated neutron emission rates and identify potential advantages and limitations of different neutron transport models.

It is important to note that the WWR model is purely descriptive and cannot predict the actual fission power generated by a given reactor design. However, it can help determine if there exists any structural features of the fuel assembly or coolant channel that contribute significantly to the observed fission yield differences. By visualizing the predicted neutron fluxes in comparison to those measured experimentally, analysts can analyze the cause of observed differences and assess whether they are statistically significant or consistent with known interferences.
