# 2.Background Introduction

If you’ve been following artificial intelligence (AI) news lately, chances are that you’ve heard of companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft embracing A.I. in various industries including finance, healthcare, transportation, and e-commerce. It seems likely that your career has taken a big leap forward as a result. 

When deciding which sector you would like to enter, it helps to ask yourself if AI is applicable to your specific industry. Are you looking for a breakthrough opportunity in finance or healthcare? Do you need to automate complex regulatory workflows in transportation or simplify shipping logistics through machine learning algorithms?

Based on your industry interests, here is some background information you should know before getting started:

1. Finance: The AI market in finance is relatively nascent but booming. Companies like JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, and Home Depot are already using AI techniques to automate complex loan approvals, reduce risk, and increase accuracy. However, their investment strategies still rely heavily on human judgment and are often subject to biases due to human error and non-optimal decision-making processes.

2. Healthcare: The rise of digital medical records has created unprecedented opportunities for companies to apply AI techniques to diagnose diseases faster and accurately. For instance, providers like Johnson & Johnson, Cigna, Rochester Institute of Technology, and Allianz have developed computer systems that can analyze clinical data and identify symptoms based on patterns, without needing experts to review each individual case. But even small improvements made by these companies have a significant impact on patient outcomes and cost savings across the board.

3. Transportation: Artificial intelligence is increasingly transforming mobility and logistics, leading to improved safety, reduced costs, and increased flexibility. For example, banks like Chase and Boeing have partnered with researchers to develop self-driving cars that can navigate environments autonomously and safely navigate around obstacles. Additionally, startups like Uber and Lyft have built software that predicts traffic conditions and routes passengers accordingly, enabling them to optimize vehicle scheduling and minimize congestion. Overall, advances in AI are leading to substantial benefits for transportation companies.

4. E-Commerce: Today's online shopping platforms have been transformed by the application of A.I. technology. By analyzing users' behavior and preferences, businesses can provide personalized recommendations, personalized search results, and automated order fulfillment. This leads to increased conversion rates and reduced transaction fees. Startups like Ocado, Amazon, and AliExpress are implementing advanced technologies like recommendation engines, natural language processing (NLP), and deep neural networks (DNNs). These advancements enable businesses to reach customers far beyond traditional retail channels, creating entirely new forms of engagement for consumers.

In summary, the potential benefit of becoming a technical co-founder in any of these industries lies in gaining access to a vast array of cutting-edge technology solutions to automate repetitive tasks, streamline business processes, and enhance customer experiences. There is no shortage of talented individuals who are ready to step up and take the lead in this field. So, why wait longer and consider joining a strong team to achieve your goals?
