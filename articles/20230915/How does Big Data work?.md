Big data is a term that has become increasingly popular in recent years due to the explosive growth of internet-connected devices and systems, as well as their ability to collect massive amounts of data at high velocity. In this article we will discuss how big data works and what are its key characteristics such as volume, variety, velocity, veracity, etc., which help us understand its importance for businesses today. We will also look into different types of big data technologies and analyze how they can be applied to real-world problems using examples from social media analysis, fraud detection, IoT (Internet of Things), traffic monitoring, weather prediction, mining big financial data, etc., which will enable users to get insights from large datasets generated by various sources, enabling them to make better business decisions.
## 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology

Before discussing about how big data works, it is essential to define some basic concepts and terminology related to it. 

### Volume

Volume refers to the amount of data produced or collected by an organization over a specific time period. It could refer to number of transactions processed, records stored on disk, tweets posted online, bytes transmitted through a network, videos uploaded by customers, etc., all these activities generate big data. The amount of data generated per unit time varies depending upon factors like type of data being collected, size of dataset, frequency of data generation, etc.

For instance, if an e-commerce website generates around 1 million orders every day, then each order contains information such as customer details, billing address, product information, shipping details, payment details, etc., resulting in significant volumes of data generated daily. On the other hand, if only one user logs in every week and makes three purchases within a month, there may not be much value in storing those transactional details individually, but rather group them together based on common features such as customer ID, date/time stamp, location, device used, etc., leading to small volumes of aggregated data.

In summary, the volume of data depends on many factors including domain, purpose, nature of source data, quality of collection methods, storage capacity available, etc. Moreover, the rate at which new data is generated in organizations is always growing and so must the ability of traditional databases to handle the volume of data generated. 

### Variety

Variety refers to the diverse set of data captured in big data. It includes multiple forms of structured, semi-structured, unstructured, and mixed data, ranging from textual data such as web pages, email messages, documents, audio files, video clips, etc., to numerical data such as sales figures, stock prices, sensor readings, etc. Each form of data possesses its own unique attributes, patterns, trends, relationships with other pieces of data. Therefore, big data involves analyzing and understanding the intrinsic properties of vast quantities of diverse data.

For example, when analysing web search queries on Google, we might encounter several variations of keywords being searched for, such as "running shoes" vs "nike running shoes", "run fast" vs "run faster", "workout plan" vs "exercise routine". This diversity in terms of keywords reflects both the breadth and depth of interest of people searching for products and services on the Internet. Similarly, while working with IoT (Internet of Things) devices generating millions of data points in real-time, we often come across different sensors and actuators, each producing its own streams of data with different formats, sample rates, encodings, etc.

In summary, the variety of data captured in big data increases significantly because of the sheer scale of data generated by modern digital environments. Various sources produce a wide range of data with varying structures, contexts, and usage scenarios. These data need to be analyzed and understood in detail to provide meaningful insights for decision making and problem solving.

### Velocity

Velocity refers to the speed at which data is generated, transferred, and processed. It represents the pace at which new data is being produced in organizations and enables businesses to respond swiftly to changes in conditions or events occurring in real-time. As the size of raw data grows exponentially, the rate of processing becomes limited by computational resources and algorithms capable of handling large volumes of data quickly. With the advent of cloud computing and big data analytics platforms, businesses have started leveraging machine learning algorithms to extract valuable insights from the ever-growing volumes of data being generated by sensors, mobile apps, social media feeds, and other sources. However, the same cannot be said for historical data where a company needs to find patterns, trends, and correlations that were once hidden in tens of thousands of rows of flat file databases.

With the development of scalable distributed processing frameworks, businesses can now process large volumes of data at petabyte scales, achieving near-real-time results. Although rapid advances in big data technologies have made significant progress towards meeting the challenges of dealing with big data, we still face numerous challenges to overcome before big data fully revolutionizes businesses’ operations and strategies. For instance, most companies struggle with managing massive amounts of data without proper techniques such as data warehousing and database indexing, which requires careful planning, expertise, and investment. Additionally, businesses require continuous training and upkeep to stay competitive in the age of big data and technological innovation. Despite these challenges, big data continues to play a crucial role in driving transformational change across industries and sectors.
