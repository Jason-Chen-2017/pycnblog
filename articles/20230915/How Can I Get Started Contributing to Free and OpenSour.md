# 2.Introduction
In recent years, technology has revolutionized our lives from simple video games to social media platforms to advanced artificial intelligence systems. Almost every aspect of our daily life relies on these technologies; yet most people rarely think about how they could even partake in the creative process or contribute something back to improve them. It’s not surprising then that a significant portion of technologists consider contributing to FOSS projects to benefit the community beyond their individual interests. But what does it actually mean to contribute to FOSS projects? Should anyone invest time and effort into contributing to FOSS projects regardless of their skill set, education level, or financial means? 

To answer these questions, let us take a closer look at the meaning and purpose of FOSS contribution and explore its unique characteristics alongside its unique benefits. 

Firstly, FOSS contribution refers to voluntary participation in the creation and maintenance of FOSS projects. It is important to emphasize that while everyone can contribute to FOSS projects, only certain individuals earn recognition and accrue rewards for doing so. This is true both economically and morally; FOSS developers must demonstrate sustained commitment to the mission of creating high quality, reliable software packages that enable the widespread distribution of knowledge. Despite this ethical imperative, it is crucial for contributors to ensure their efforts are aligned with the long term goals of the project. In other words, contributors should avoid becoming “the good guy” or driving away potentially capable colleagues by engaging in activities that hinder the project’s growth or disrupt its users.  

Secondly, while FOSS projects typically allow for direct contributions, it is crucial to note that many projects also employ a collaborative coding style where multiple contributors work together to resolve issues and implement new features. This creates a positive feedback loop where improvements made by one contributor are received and discussed by others, resulting in greater efficiency and better overall quality. Additionally, working on large projects requires strong communication skills which can only be developed over time through experience and practice. Finally, FOSS projects often host a public discussion forum where experienced users and developers can provide support and feedback to fellow contributors. This helps to prevent duplication of effort, promotes learning opportunities, and builds trust between participants.

Thirdly, FOSS projects generally adopt a transparent decision-making culture where the source code of a project is freely accessible to the general public. Understanding the rationale behind the decisions made during the development process is critical when evaluating alternative design choices or making informed suggestions for improvement. Furthermore, FOSS projects aim to maintain a high level of software reliability and availability, but sometimes this goal conflicts with the needs of the user base. A prudent approach to addressing potential concerns would be to communicate expectations clearly throughout the contribution process and establish transparent standards of conduct for the project itself. 

Lastly, FOSS projects are relatively easy to join due to their transparency, low barrier to entry, and broad range of expertise across a diverse spectrum of topics. Anyone can submit bug reports, request feature implementations, suggest documentation updates, report and fix bugs, review proposed changes, and offer feedback on other contributions. As such, the amount of work involved in getting involved in FOSS projects can vary significantly depending on personal skills, familiarity with the codebase, and dedication to the cause. Nevertheless, it is worth taking a moment to evaluate the specifics of your involvement and plan accordingly, focusing on areas where you feel ready to give back and demonstrating a genuine interest in improving the community. 


Before we move forward with explaining FOSS contribution in detail, let us clarify the terminology and key concepts necessary for a thorough understanding of FOSS contribution. These include: 

1. Source Code - This is the actual code written in the programming language of choice. Developers usually refer to the source code of a project as "the stuff that matters" and spend a lot of time developing it.

2. Bug Fixing - When an error occurs or incorrect functionality is present in a program, developers attempt to identify the root cause of the problem and patch it using appropriate code fixes. Bug fixing involves locating and correcting errors in code by modifying it.

3. Enhancement Request - Sometimes, instead of reporting a bug, someone might come up with an idea for adding a new feature to a program. They propose the enhancement by describing what the new feature should do and why it would add value to the program. An enhancement proposal usually goes through several rounds of testing and refinement until it is approved and implemented. 

4. Pull Request - After submitting an enhancement request, developers fork the repository of the project and push their modified code to their remote branch. Then, they create a pull request that asks the project owner to merge their modifications into the master branch of the repository. A pull request serves two main purposes: to showcase the developer's capabilities and increase project visibility.

5. Version Control System (VCS) - VCS allows developers to track the changes made to the source code over time. It enables developers to revert to previous versions if needed, compare differences between files, and share their progress with other team members. Popular VCS services include GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and SourceForge.

6. Issue Tracking System (ITS) - Similar to a to-do list, ITS keeps track of tasks assigned to developers and shows the status of each task. It enables developers to prioritize and manage their workload effectively. Issues can be reported using a variety of formats, including text messages, emails, and online forms. Common ITS platforms include Jira, YouTrack, Trello, and Redmine.

7. Git Workflow - This is a particular method of branching and merging code in a distributed manner. It includes the process of cloning a repository, branching off a new feature branch, making changes to the code, and finally merging the changes back into the original repository. There are several common git workflows, including Fork-and-Pull Model, Feature Branch Model, Continuous Integration / Delivery Pipeline, etc.

8. Collaboration Tools - Although not strictly required for contribution, collaborative coding environments and chat applications can greatly enhance the productivity of FOSS contributors. For example, developers can use chat rooms, mailing lists, and issue trackers to discuss ideas, troubleshoot problems, and collaborate on larger tasks. Popular collaboration tool options include Slack, Discord, Gitter, Mattermost, and Teams.

9. Licenses - Each FOSS project uses a license that specifies under what conditions the source code can be copied, modified, and distributed. Most popular licenses include Apache, BSD, GPL, LGPL, MPL, and EPL.


# 3.Key Concepts: Contribution Guidelines, Commit Messages, and Code Reviews

When considering contributing to FOSS projects, it is vital to adhere to proper contribution guidelines and procedures. The purpose of contribution guidelines is to define the expectations for how developers can interact with the project and work together. Proper guidelines help to ensure consistency amongst contributors, encourage high-quality submissions, and maximize the chance of success in the project's long term governance. The exact wording of the guidelines can vary based on the project's policies and philosophy, but here are some common elements to consider:

1. Getting Started Guide: Provide a step-by-step guide on how to get started with the project, including installation instructions, configuration details, and links to tutorials or examples. This guide can save developers hours of frustration and confusion if they need to learn how to use the project's infrastructure or environment.

2. Code Style Guides: Consistent code style improves the legibility and comprehension of the source code, making it easier for newcomers to navigate and understand the codebase. Providing consistent formatting rules, naming conventions, and commenting conventions can go a long way in achieving this goal.

3. Community Guidelines: Many FOSS projects come with a built-in community of developers who constantly share their thoughts, experiences, and struggles with the project. It is important to provide clear rules on how to interact with and engage with other contributors, from answers to frequently asked questions to discussions on preferred styles and techniques.

4. Contributor Roles and Responsibilities: Depending on the size and complexity of the project, different roles and responsibilities can be defined. For smaller projects with limited resources, a single role, responsible for reviewing and approving pull requests, may suffice. However, larger projects with dedicated teams of developers may need to assign more specialized roles, such as maintainers, committers, reviewers, and moderators. 

5. Roadmap: Most FOSS projects document their future plans or roadmaps in a file called ROADMAP.md or similar. Keeping this document up-to-date and communicating it regularly to interested parties ensures that contributors know what the project aims to achieve, what the next big milestone is, and how to contribute towards it.

6. Release Notes: Every major release of a project should be accompanied by release notes that highlight the new features added, fixed bugs, and known issues. This document acts as a quick reference for end users and developers alike, allowing them to quickly assess the impact of upgrading.

7. Security Policy: Some FOSS projects enforce security measures to protect against malicious attacks or intrusions. Publicizing these measures is crucial since attackers may exploit vulnerabilities found in the source code. Including a security policy in the CONTRIBUTING.md file makes it clear how to report security vulnerabilities and responsibly disclose them to project owners.


Once developers agree to abide by the project's contribution guidelines, it becomes essential to properly format their commits and write descriptive commit messages. Good commit messages capture the essence of the change introduced by the commit, making it easier for other developers to understand what was done and why. Here are some common elements to include in a commit message:

1. Summary Line: The first line of a commit message should briefly describe the change(s) included in the commit. This line should begin with a verb in the infinitive form (-ing), followed by a noun phrase describing what was changed. Examples of summaries include "Add feature X", "Fix bug Y", "Update API endpoint Z".

2. Details Section: If the summary alone is not sufficient to fully explain the change(s) being committed, additional lines of context should be added below the summary. These lines should provide background information related to the change(s), such as related issues or bugs, tests performed, and performance benchmarks.

3. Footer: The footer section contains metadata about the commit, such as the username and email address of the author. It is often used to link to relevant issues or pull requests, if applicable. Other common footers include Signed-off-by, Co-authored-by, Closes #XXXX, and Fixes #YYYY.


Finally, it is essential to perform code reviews to detect and fix bugs, identify redundant code, optimize performance, and improve overall code quality. The goal of code reviews is to catch mistakes early, ensure accurate implementation, and promote consistency across the codebase. During a code review, developers should focus on logical organization, naming conventions, comments, and test coverage. They should also make sure to check for security vulnerabilities and sensitive information leaks. To perform a code review, developers should make comments directly on the relevant code lines or leave general suggestions in the form of inline comments. In addition to submitting comments, developers can approve or reject a PR after finishing their review.


Overall, following established contribution guidelines and using standard workflows for issue tracking, versioning, and code review can significantly reduce the burden and uncertainty associated with contributing to FOSS projects. By sharing clear and precise instructions, creating welcoming communities, and proactively identifying and tackling obstacles to contribution, FOSS projects can thrive and grow exponentially.
