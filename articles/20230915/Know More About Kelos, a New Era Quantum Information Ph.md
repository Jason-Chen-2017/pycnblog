# 1.简介
  

Kelos is a quantum information physicist and senior consultant to R&D team at VMware Inc. He was appointed as one of the founders in 2019 after his graduation from National University of Singapore (NUS) with a Bachelor degree in Physics and Computer Science. The mission of VMware R&D is to create next generation technologies that help people solve problems through more powerful means than traditional methods such as computers and data processing. One area where he has had significant contributions are quantum computing and its applications for next-gen communications. 

With multiple years of experience working in the field of quantum technology and leading the development of new technologies in this space including IBM Q, IonQ, Rigetti Computing Platforms, Microsoft Quantum Development Kit, etc., Kelos currently leads the development of advanced algorithms and tools for quantum systems based on machine learning and artificial intelligence principles, alongside creating educational materials on how quantum computation can be used effectively for communication and control systems.

In this blog article, I will provide an overview of Kelos' work and talk about some specific topics related to quantum computing and communication. In particular, we will focus on the recent advances in quantifying uncertainty, channel capacity, and quantum error correction. We will discuss what role these concepts have played in shaping the future of communications, particularly when it comes to low power and high speed wireless networks. We will also give insights into the unique challenges associated with quantum key distribution protocols and practical techniques for developing them. Finally, I will summarize our overall takeaways and leave room for questions or follow up comments. 

# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before getting into the details of Kelos' research and technical contributions, let's first go over some basic definitions and terminology:

1. Quantum Mechanics - A mathematical theory of matter that describes how atoms behave and interact within macroscopic environments. It uses mathematical concepts such as quantum states, quantum logic gates, and laws of physics to describe the behavior of electrons and nuclei in atoms and molecules. 

2. Quantum Computation - An experimental technique that involves using quantum mechanical effects to manipulate quantum states and encode classical information in quantum states, making it possible to perform calculations without the need for actual quantum hardware. This enables quantum computers to simulate and process complex problems much faster than conventional supercomputers or even digital analog computers. Quantum algorithms are typically written in a language called quantum assembly language, which consists of instructions encoded using qubits and quantum gates.

3. Quantum Error Correction - A fault-tolerant protocol for correcting errors introduced during the transmission of quantum information. The most common form of quantum error correction is quantum codes, which map the input message into an output codeword that can later be decoded back into the original message. Coded messages suffer less damage due to errors than their original uncoded version.

4. Channel Capacity - The maximum rate of information transfer per unit time that a quantum channel can support. It represents the upper bound of the number of bits that can be transmitted reliably over the channel in a given amount of time.

5. Uncertainty Principle - Understanding the uncertainty principle helps us understand the limitations of current communications technologies. It says that no two pieces of information can be simultaneously communicated without distortion or loss of information. The uncertainty principle tells us that the physical properties of light and matter cannot be completely controlled by any single source of energy alone; instead, there must always be some degree of randomness present to prevent correlations between independent sources of energy. The uncertainty principle offers insight into why efficient quantum error correction mechanisms like Shor's algorithm fail to meet the requirements of secure communications. 

6. Linear Programming - Optimization technique for finding the optimal solution among many possible choices. In linear programming, we want to find the values of decision variables (such as stock levels or production capacities) that maximize or minimize some objective function (such as profit). Linear programming solves this problem by converting it into a set of equations and solving them efficiently using matrix multiplication.
