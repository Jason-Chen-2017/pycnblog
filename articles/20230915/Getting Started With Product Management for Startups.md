# 1.简介
  

As the world’s largest technology company grows and expands, it is crucial to become a product-focused organization capable of delivering high quality products in an efficient manner. 

Product management is the process by which businesses develop strategic plans that focus on product development. It involves identifying what customers want, developing new products or improving existing ones, and ultimately providing those products to end users. Successful product managers must be able to communicate effectively with stakeholders, marketers, and other executives to ensure their visions are translated into reality. The right product manager can turn ideas into actionable strategies and execute them across multiple touchpoints—from idea to customer acquisition, marketing, sales, service delivery, and beyond. This article will cover how you can get started as a product manager for your startup using practical examples from real companies such as Google and Facebook.

# 2.产品管理定义及职责
Product management is responsible for creating and maintaining a roadmap for your company's strategy towards producing high-quality products. At its core, product management focuses on maximizing profitability through effective use of resources and eliminating wastage while achieving user satisfaction. In addition, product management ensures that the company delivers products that satisfy target markets and expectations. To achieve this, product management requires a well-structured approach to planning, execution, and communication with key stakeholders throughout the lifecycle of the product. 


To define product management specifically for startups, we should emphasize that they have very limited financial resources and need to make sure that they produce valuable products while still being affordable. Accordingly, product management roles within startups often involve more hands-on activities than traditional corporate organizations, as many aspects of managing products do not require large investments. Moreover, there may also be less formalized structure around decision making or project management processes. However, the overall goal should still be to provide value and improve customer experience.

## 3.1 一般职责
A product manager at any stage of the lifecycle of a product needs to manage several different tasks:

### 3.1.1 Ideation and exploration
The first step in product development is to identify potential customers and explore different options. A product manager may work closely with the CEO or VP of research and development to gain insights about desired features and audience segments. They might also collaborate with design teams to create concepts and prototypes for testing out various ideas before committing fully to one direction.

### 3.1.2 Requirement gathering and analysis
Once the problem is well-defined and an initial concept has been developed, the next step is to gather requirements and analyze business metrics. Depending on the complexity of the product and the nature of the company, this may include interviews with stakeholders, surveys of current customers, and analyzing data reports. The product manager then uses these insights to prioritize upcoming features based on criticality and risk.

### 3.1.3 Design and development
After defining priorities, the product manager takes over responsibility for planning and executing development tasks. They might consult with engineers, designers, and others in the company to determine the best way to build the product from scratch, or hire third-party developers if necessary. Once ready, the product manager makes final decisions regarding implementation details, including tools, technologies, and platforms to use.

### 3.1.4 Testing and deployment
With a working prototype in hand, the product manager tests it thoroughly to ensure functionality and performance meet standards set by the product owner. If issues are found, the product manager works with engineering to address them and retest until everything passes muster. After all bugs have been squashed, the product manager deploys the product to production so that customers can begin enjoying it.

### 3.1.5 Maintenance and support
Over time, the product may encounter bugs or problems that require maintenance or updates. As part of ongoing product management responsibilities, the product manager maintains up-to-date documentation to ensure everyone understands how to operate the product after it has been deployed. Furthermore, if needed, the product manager coordinates with internal or external support staff to troubleshoot and resolve issues when they arise.

## 3.2 技能要求
In order to successfully run a product management function at a startup, someone needs to possess strong technical skills related to software development, business understanding, marketing, and communications. Here are some general skill sets to consider:

1. Strong problem-solving abilities: Startups face unique challenges compared to established companies because they typically don't have access to massive amounts of capital or expensive infrastructure. Therefore, product management functions usually rely heavily on creativity and innovation. This requires a deep understanding of the product itself and the competitive landscape in order to come up with novel solutions.

2. Excellent communication skills: Startups quickly move between departments, locations, and cultures. Therefore, product management functions frequently need to translate complex information into simple language that non-technical people can understand. The ability to explain complex topics clearly and concisely is essential to building trust and credibility with stakeholders.

3. Experience in agile methods: Although startups may initially favor waterfall models for project management, it's becoming increasingly popular to try out iterative or Agile approaches like Scrum. While feature-driven development cycles are becoming more commonplace, continuous improvement is important for long-term success.

4. Knowledge of industry trends: Products are constantly evolving and changing, so startups need to stay abreast of the latest technologies and advancements to stay ahead of the competition. Product management roles require an eye for market trends and can help influence future directions by influencing product strategy.
