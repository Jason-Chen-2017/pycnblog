## Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the use of computational techniques to understand and manipulate human languages, whether spoken or written. NLP includes tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, topic modeling, machine translation, speech-to-text conversion, text classification, information retrieval, and question answering. In this article, we will focus on advanced topics in natural language processing using the popular Python library called Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). These advanced topics include syntactic parsing, semantic analysis, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, coreference resolution, and sentiment analysis using lexicons and classifiers. We also discuss applications of these algorithms in real-world scenarios including chatbots, web crawling, search engines, sentiment analysis for social media data, natural language generation, medical informatics, bioinformatics, and more.

## Why NLTK?
NLTK stands for Natural Language Toolkit and is one of the most widely used libraries for natural language processing in Python. It provides efficient access to various resources like corpora, models, tools, and documentation. Furthermore, it is easy to learn and has many active developers who contribute new features, bug fixes, and enhancements over time.
