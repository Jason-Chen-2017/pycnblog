# 1.简介
  

Computational scientific discovery refers to a process of solving complex problems by applying mathematical models or algorithms using computing resources such as computers, supercomputers, cloud platforms etc. It has become increasingly important in recent years due to the growing volume and complexity of data generated in various fields such as science, engineering, medicine, biology etc. However, current computational sciences have been struggling with the massive amount of data, which poses new challenges including scalability, efficiency, and reproducibility. In this perspective article, we will focus on how machine learning and big data can contribute to computational scientific discovery and provide opportunities for future research directions. We will discuss some key issues related to these developments, their benefits, potential limitations, and future trends.

# 2.背景介绍
The National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), located at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, is one of the largest and most advanced supercomputer centers globally. NCSA hosts several high performance clusters, each consisting of up to 5,000 compute nodes. These clusters are connected via a global interconnection network that provides high bandwidth connectivity between different parts of the world. The IT infrastructure provided by NCSA enables users to run large scale applications in parallel across all clusters simultaneously, thereby achieving significant speedup over conventional serial applications. 

Innovations in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized modern computer science. Researchers in the field have developed many advanced algorithms that enable machines to learn patterns and make predictions based on data inputs. Today, AI/ML techniques have been applied extensively in various fields, including natural language processing, image recognition, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis. One major challenge faced by computational scientists today is scaling up existing computationally heavy applications to handle larger volumes of data. This requires innovative methods for data management, storage, processing, and analysis.

To address these challenges, NCSA leverages its high performance cluster architecture, available computing power, and interconnected network to host an extensive collection of machine learning and big data tools and technologies. The core components of the technology platform include Hadoop, Apache Spark, and TensorFlow. These tools and technologies were designed to solve specific problems such as distributed file systems, distributed computing, machine learning, and deep neural networks, but they also offer novel approaches for addressing other scientific challenges, such as graph analytics, social network mining, time series analysis, and anomaly detection. The use of these technologies allows researchers to tackle large-scale problems in a more efficient way than traditional single-machine solutions, while still ensuring reproducible results and allowing for easy integration into existing workflows and processes.

## 3.1. Data Science
Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that integrates programming, statistics, domain knowledge, and applied mathematics. Its goal is to extract valuable insights from raw data collected from multiple sources to support decision making and achieve better outcomes. There are three main subfields within data science - 

1. Data Analysis - This involves exploring, cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data to find meaningful insights and uncover patterns hidden within it.

2. Data Mining - This involves identifying relationships among data points by clustering them together into groups or categories, often without any prior knowledge about what those categories represent.

3. Data Visualization - This involves creating visual representations of data to help understand and communicate the information contained within it. 

Data science encompasses these areas alongside applied statistical modeling, predictive analytics, and business intelligence.

## 3.2. Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML)
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the study and design of intelligent machines that mimic human behavior. It is currently defined as a subset of machine intelligence that includes the ability to perceive, reason, and act. Traditionally, AI was associated with building hardware and software programs that exhibited human-level intelligence. With advances in machine learning and deep learning, the concept of AI is evolving towards enabling machines to perform tasks similar to humans with near-human level accuracy. Together, both disciplines form the foundation of the field called machine learning. Here's a brief overview of ML:

1. Supervised Learning - This involves training a model using labeled input data where the desired output is known. Examples of supervised learning include classification and regression problems.

2. Unsupervised Learning - This involves training a model using unlabeled input data where no prior knowledge exists about the desired output. Examples of unsupervised learning include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

3. Reinforcement Learning - This involves training a model using feedback from its actions to improve its performance. Examples of reinforcement learning include autonomous vehicles and robotics.

4. Deep Learning - This involves training complex models by stacking layers of neurons, starting with simpler ones, until the final layer learns higher-level features from the input. Examples of deep learning include convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks.

## 3.3. Big Data
Big data refers to a wide range of digital information that is being produced at an unprecedented rate. The explosion in data volume coupled with sophisticated algorithms and tools has enabled companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon to collect and analyze vast amounts of data, providing real-time insights that enable them to make smart decisions. The importance of big data lies not just in its size, but also in its variety, velocity, and variability, which makes it difficult to store, manage, and analyze. By leveraging big data analytics capabilities, organizations can identify emerging patterns, correlations, and trends, inform customer behaviors, and optimize operations. Additionally, businesses can make effective use of data to increase profits, improve customer satisfaction, reduce costs, and boost productivity.

## 3.4. HPC
HPC stands for high-performance computing, which refers to the practice of running large computations on diverse processors, memory architectures, and networks. It offers faster performance than traditional centralized computing models and is critical in various domains such as financial services, healthcare, and defense. HPC environments typically consist of thousands of processors working concurrently, each having their own local memory and cache, and sharing access to shared memory locations. While individual processors may be fast, the system as a whole may take hours or even days to complete a task. The best HPC environments rely on special purpose hardware, optimized software libraries, and dedicated administrators who are well versed in optimizing application performance and minimizing communication bottlenecks. Some of the key elements of HPC include:

1. Cluster Architectures - Clusters generally consist of numerous servers organized into interconnected networks, each housing tens or hundreds of processors. Each processor consists of specialized processing units, memory modules, and I/O devices, which work together to execute jobs efficiently.

2. Distributed Computing Platforms - Distributed computing platforms allow programmers to write applications that span multiple nodes, reducing overall latency and improving throughput. Popular distributed computing frameworks include Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and OpenMPI.

3. Job Schedulers - Job schedulers determine the allocation of resources to user jobs, based on priority, resource availability, and constraints such as job dependencies. They operate continuously monitoring the status of submitted jobs and adjusting the allocated resources accordingly to maintain optimal utilization of the cluster.

4. Programming Models - High-performance computing presents unique challenges compared to general-purpose programming languages. Programmers must carefully consider low-level details such as memory access patterns and synchronization mechanisms, leading to significant overhead when writing code for modern clusters. Many programming models are emerging to simplify development and optimization of HPC applications. Some popular programming models include CUDA, MPI, and OpenMP.
