# 1.简介
  

Data is the most important resource in our digital world. It helps us discover patterns, make predictions, and solve problems that we face every day. However, with the rapid growth of big data, a lot of factors such as noise, bias, errors, and diversity have been brought into play. To maintain the quality and consistency of data, it becomes essential to use appropriate techniques, tools, and methods for cleaning, enriching, analyzing, and integrating data. In this article, I will introduce several basic concepts of Data Quality Management (DQM) and explain their significance in maintaining high-quality data. Moreover, I will illustrate different DQM approaches by giving examples on how to clean and process datasets using various methods such as deduplication, data augmentation, clustering, etc., which can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of data analysis. Finally, I will discuss some challenges in DQM and suggest future research directions for advancing DQM technologies. 

# 2.Basic concepts and terms
## 2.1 Data Quality Management (DQM)
Data Quality Management (DQM), also known as Data Governance or Business Intelligence DQM, refers to a set of processes, methodologies, tools, and frameworks that aim at ensuring the reliability, completeness, validity, and usefulness of data before they are used for decision making. DQM involves managing three main aspects: data quality, data integrity, and data governance. The first two aspects focus on ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of the raw data collected from multiple sources. On the other hand, data governance ensures that stakeholders have access to reliable and accurate data throughout the business process. Overall, DQM aims to achieve better decisions based on sound data that is trustworthy, consistent, and relevant to the needs of the organization.

## 2.2 Dataset
A dataset consists of all available information related to an entity or subject, typically represented as a table, matrix, graph, or database. A dataset may include attributes or dimensions, facts or measures, and descriptive metadata about its content. For example, a dataset could contain sales figures for a specific product over a period of time, including geographic location, date sold, price, quantity sold, and revenue. Each attribute or dimension represents a distinct feature of the subject being measured, while each fact or measure captures the value obtained for those features on a particular instance in time. Descriptive metadata includes author, source, copyright information, version number, update frequency, last updated timestamp, and any other relevant details.

## 2.3 Attribute
An attribute is a measurable property or characteristic of something. It describes qualities that can be observed or experienced. Attributes define what makes up a dataset and identify the entities involved in the measurement process. Examples of commonly used attributes in datasets include customer name, age, income, address, city, state, zip code, date, time, duration, amount spent, product category, type of service provided, brand of clothing, stock level, website URL, email address, phone number, rating, review text, occupation, education level, and so on.

## 2.4 Facts
Facts represent measurements taken on individual instances in time or space of one or more attributes. They provide quantitative information about the real-world phenomena being analyzed and help to establish causality between them. Commonly used facts in datasets include transaction amounts, cost per unit, profit margin, number of visitors, employee turnover rate, credit score, loan status, flight arrival delay, and so on.

## 2.5 Quality Dimensions
Quality dimensions refer to the degree to which a given attribute or fact meets certain criteria, standards, or expectations. These characteristics indicate whether the data is complete, valid, accurate, consistent, timely, and relevant to a specific purpose. Some common quality dimensions include completeness, accuracy, consistency, veracity, freshness, authority, uniqueness, and provenance. Completeness refers to the extent to which the dataset contains observations of all possible cases of interest. Accuracy indicates the degree to which the actual values in the dataset match the intended meaning or interpretation. Consistency refers to the logical relationship amongst the values within the dataset. Veracity refers to the credibility and legitimacy of the data source, especially if it has come from experts or third parties. Freshness refers to the timeliness and recency of data collection. Authority refers to the expertise, knowledge, experience, and judgment of the data steward or analyst who created the dataset. Uniqueness refers to the absence of duplicates, irregularities, or outliers within the dataset. Provenance refers to the origin, source, ownership, control, and integrity of the data.
