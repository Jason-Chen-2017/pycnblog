Cell size is one of the most crucial features in many biological systems such as developmental processes or cancer cell growth. It controls the shape and dimensionality of a cell’s morphology and affects various aspects like tissue architecture, migration patterns, protein expression levels, and signal transmission properties. Therefore, it has been an important research topic for years with several techniques developed to control cell size, including electrical stimulation (epigenetics), genetic modification (CRISPR-Cas9), flow cytometry based approaches, and imaging methods. 

The conventional means of controlling cell size using extracellular matrix probes relies on small unregulated chemical signals generated by molecules such as DNA polymerase, histones, and acetyl groups. However, these means cannot efficiently generate large single-cell fluorescence traces that are required for precise control of cell size. Moreover, manual manipulation of cell size via physical forces can be hazardous and time-consuming during experiments.

Recent advances in digital image processing have enabled us to use engineered vectors or signals to directly manipulate cell size without relying on chemically generated extracellular signals. One popular method of manipulating cell size through engineered vector-based approaches is through ECM-induced gene silencing and staining. Here, we will discuss how this technique works and present its potential applications in different biological contexts.

Extracellular matrix probes have been used extensively to control cell size since their discovery in the late 1970s. They provide indirect control over cell size by indirectly affecting the amount and location of bound proteins, which regulate transcription rates. Many cell lines have been used as model organisms in studying the effects of ECM control of cell size, such as human breast cells, mouse embryonic stem cells, or zebrafish hepatocyte lineage cells.

Staining protocols have also been used to control cell size in vitro. These include microfluidic bacteriophages or the mitochondrial coatings called dynamic nuclear photomicrographs (DNC). In vivo studies have shown that targeting specific chromatin loci (such as nucleosomes) produces long-lasting changes in cell size within seconds or minutes, enabling high-precision cell size control.

However, these traditional methods require complex equipment and expertise and may not be suitable for all types of biological systems. For instance, the need for specialized hardware and highly skilled laboratories makes experimentation challenging even for experienced researchers who understand the principles behind the technology but lack the technical skills necessary to perform real-world experiments. Furthermore, only limited number of cells can be studied simultaneously due to the difficulty of preparing and maintaining experimental conditions while using animal models.

Digital image processing techniques, particularly those involved in analyzing images captured under wide field-of-view (WFOV) light-sheet microscopes, offer powerful tools for manipulating cell size at sub-micron resolution. By capturing and processing images from multiple angles, single cells can be targeted and manipulated through their entire surface area rather than just a few pixels. This opens up new possibilities for applying advanced technologies to explore the interplay between structure and function of the cell.

One promising application of ECM-based cell size manipulation lies in investigating neurodegeneration. The ability of natural killer cells (NKCs) to target and suppress neural crest cells (NCCs) has been proposed as a mechanism underlying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Meniere’s disease. While NKCs can activate NCCs by binding to their receptors, they can also directly damage them by introducing toxins into their cytoplasm. To address this issue, scientists are currently looking for novel therapeutics that can treat neurons by inhibiting NKC-mediated interactions.

Here, we focus on developing an efficient computational framework to analyze and quantify the chromatin structures responsible for determining cell size in response to external signals, and develop optimized algorithms to accurately measure cell sizes in living cells. We propose a novel approach, called Enhanced Chromatin Modeling (ECM)-assisted Tracking (ACT), that uses engineered vectors produced by ECMs to track individual cells across the cell cycle and derive their sizes at multiple time points. ACT can optimize sampling strategies to capture the largest possible range of fluorescent signals, and can accurately estimate both cell size dynamics and genome-wide scaling relationships between cell size and other factors such as age, sex, drug dosage, and temperature.
