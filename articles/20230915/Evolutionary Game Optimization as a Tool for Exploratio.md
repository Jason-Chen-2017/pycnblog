Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning that enables agents to learn from experience through trial-and-error interactions with the environment. It has been widely applied to numerous applications such as robotics, gaming, finance, healthcare, etc., but it faces several challenges. One challenge lies in exploiting both knowledge learned from experiences and novelty generated by new environments. The key to solve this problem is to balance exploration and exploitation during training. However, existing exploration strategies such as random sampling are often suboptimal due to their high variance and slow convergence speeds. In contrast, game theory offers a promising alternative: use evolutionary algorithms (EAs), which can dynamically select actions based on fitness functions based on past experience without being biased by prior assumptions about rewards or transitions. In this paper, we propose a method called Evolutionary Game Optimization (EGPO) using a coevolutionary approach between two RL agents to explore efficiently while exploiting opportunities created by novel environments. Specifically, we formulate the task of exploration as a multi-agent cooparative game where each agent tries to maximize its own payoff function subject to constraints defined by the other agents' behaviors. We then design an optimization algorithm called EGPO-EA to find optimal policies jointly over multiple games. Experiments show that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for tasks involving complex interactions among multiple agents. Moreover, we evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm in real-world environments and demonstrate how it can be used in domains ranging from robotics to video game AI.

In recent years, deep reinforcement learning techniques have shown tremendous progress in solving challenging control problems in various domains. Most notably, AlphaGo, Google DeepMind's artificial intelligence system that defeated the top human go player, demonstrates the power of combining multiple neural networks and heuristics to play at a human level. Another famous example is OpenAI's GPT-3, which generates natural language text using just one prompt, demonstrating the ability of large models to learn complex underlying patterns and structures. Despite these breakthroughs, there are still many challenges remaining to be addressed, including long training times and limited sample efficiency. One possible solution is to leverage meta-learning techniques like transfer learning and self-play to improve sample efficiency and reduce the amount of required data. Similarly, Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) offer an alternative approach to explore complex non-stationary spaces such as reinforcement learning environments. However, they typically rely on static fitness functions instead of considering the changing dynamics of the environment. In addition, EAs suffer from the curse of dimensionality, i.e., increasing the number of dimensions leads to exponential increase in computational complexity. 

We hope that our proposed approach will benefit both fields of research, leading towards more efficient exploration and exploitation of complex environments in reinforcement learning. Meanwhile, we also believe that applying EAs into a cooperative coevolutionary framework brings valuable insights into game-based optimization, providing a generalizable approach to address both exploration and exploitation simultaneously.

## 3.1 Multi-Agent Systems
A multi-agent system consists of multiple independent autonomous agents that interact with each other to accomplish common goals. Each agent may have different capabilities or roles, depending on its decision making strategy. Some commonly used examples include transportation systems, social networks, and air traffic control. A multi-agent system usually involves communication among its members, which makes it fundamentally different from a single-agent system. It requires careful consideration of the interaction between agents, since any action taken by one agent could influence others. For instance, if an agent sends a message to another agent indicating that it needs help, it would likely need to wait until the recipient acknowledges the message before taking further actions. Therefore, developing effective communication protocols and mechanisms across all agents becomes crucial to achieve coordinated behavior.

## 3.2 Cooperative Coevolutionary Approach
Coevolutionary approaches involve examining the effects of genetic drift, mutation, and selection on individual and collective performance of a population. It was originally proposed by Kennedy et al. (1984) to optimize the performance of ant colonies and led to much subsequent research. Population-level information sharing and competition provide powerful means for coevolution, allowing individuals to exploit resources and avoid collisions. At the same time, competition encourages diversity and enhances robustness, leading to faster adaptation and better overall performance.

Our coevolutionary framework uses a dynamic mechanism whereby two populations of agents compete against each other and exchange information to modify their strategies. Each agent plays an individual game, whose rules depend on its role in the context of the whole group. Over time, individuals converge toward a common set of solutions and develop collectively coherent policies. This process serves as a way to explore diverse regimes while exploiting unexplored opportunities within a given context. Our approach does not require extensive simulations of entire populations of agents, enabling rapid updates to emergent properties of interest. Additionally, our approach allows us to apply EAs directly to the problem of optimizing policies under cooperative conditions, rather than treating them as special cases of individual learning.

## 3.3 Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning (RL) refers to a family of algorithms designed to enable agents to learn from experience through trial-and-error interactions with the environment. Agents act in response to feedback received from the environment and seek to maximize their future reward. There are three basic components of RL: policy, value function, and environment model. Policy refers to a mapping from states to actions, and Value Function measures the expected return from following a certain policy. Environment Model represents the true dynamics of the environment and helps estimate the next state and reward.

To make good decisions, agents must consider not only immediate rewards, but also the consequences of their actions on the rest of the world. This means that an agent’s choices affect not only its immediate outcome, but also those of other actors in the environment. To maintain cooperation and coordinate effectively with other agents, it is essential to establish shared understanding of the environment and communicate clearly what actions will lead to successful outcomes. These issues are critical when working with uncertain environments, such as those arising from stochastic dynamics and interactive agents. RL provides a powerful tool for building cognitively plausible intelligent agents capable of adapting quickly to new situations and achieving near-perfect performance in challenging tasks.

The core algorithm used in EGPO is Evolutionary Game Optimization (EGPO). The algorithm takes inspiration from the coevolutionary approach and applies EAs to optimize policies jointly over multiple games in order to explore efficiently while exploiting opportunities created by novel environments. The basic idea behind EGPO is to first formulate the task of exploration as a multi-agent cooparative game where each agent tries to maximize its own payoff function subject to constraints defined by the other agents' behaviors. An example payoff function might be:

$$U(a_i) = \sum_{j\neq i} p_{ij}(x)\sum_{\tau=t}^{T}\gamma^{\tau - t}r(\tau)\\$$

where $U$ is the total utility function of agent $i$, $a_i$ is its action, $\{p_{ij}, x\}$ denotes the probability distribution of agent j's action given agent i's action and observation at timestep t, respectively, $T$ is the final timestep, $\gamma$ is the discount factor, and $r(\tau)$ is the reward obtained after timestep $\tau$. The objective of the game is to choose the best action $a^*$ that maximizes the global utility U($a^*$) while ensuring that no agent violates the mutual trust constraint.

The second step is to define the fitness function that maps a particular pair of policies (one per agent) to a scalar score reflecting its performance in terms of the game outcome. We assume that each agent follows the best policy selected by the opposing agent so far and evaluates its own policy accordingly. This fitness function is closely related to the well-known ranking-based fitness evaluation scheme employed in neuroevolution and reproductive biology. We use the ranking-based fitness evaluation scheme combined with a softmax layer to assign positive scores to dominant policies and negative scores to subordinate policies, giving some room for exploratory moves. We further normalize the scores to ensure that all policies receive equal opportunity to become the leader.

Next, we optimize the policies by performing a simple EA search over the parameter space of the policies. In practice, we use a standard gradient descent optimizer and implement crossover and mutation operations using genetic programming libraries such as DEAP. We train the network parameters iteratively to minimize the difference between the expected payoffs calculated according to the current policies and the actual payoffs experienced during the training phase. Once the optimization procedure converges, we extract the resulting policies and combine them to form the joint solution. Finally, we perform simulation experiments to measure the performance of the optimized policies compared to competitive baselines.

Overall, the algorithm combines several important concepts in cooperative coevolutionary reinforcement learning, including the concept of cooperative game playing and shared understanding of the environment. By searching for policies that result in higher utilities together, the algorithm aims to identify regions of the policy space that are potentially beneficial, even in contexts with incomplete or ambiguous information. The combination of EAs and explicit representation of policies as neural networks ensures scalability, reducing the risk of local minima and improving the rate of convergence. Finally, the algorithm enables fine-grained exploration of the policy space by leveraging the implicit nature of neural networks and explicit trade-offs made by the agents.
