# 1.简介
  

很多企业都面临着如何提高工作效率、降低成本、提升盈利能力等方面的综合性挑战。比如说，作为一名企业管理者，需要根据业务需求、竞争对手和竞争态势等因素，将工作的优先级分配到不同的团队成员和任务上。同时，还要考虑到雇佣、物质、人力资源等各种各样的约束条件，确保工作顺利进行。因此，如何制定业务计划、确定关键项目、管理资源，成为企业管理者工作的一项重要职责。

为了更好地管理企业，需要将各种资源、任务按优先级分组，并制定相应的时间表来安排工作进度。而Prioritization方法就是一种常用的工作安排方式，它能够帮助企业有效地处理复杂多变的工作情况，协调不同团队成员的工作量、分配时间和工作重点。Prioritization是指通过对工作进行分级、排序和评估，从而给出一个优先级列表，以此帮助团队取得必要的进展，确保业务目标得到有效实现。

# 2.术语定义
## 2.1 Terminology
### Priority Levels（优先级级别）
Prioritization is based on assigning a priority level to different tasks or projects depending upon the importance of those tasks and the urgency required for their completion. The priority levels are typically divided into three main categories:

1. High Priority (H) - Tasks that must be completed immediately but with low impact on business operations
2. Medium Priority (M) - Tasks that require moderate timeframe before being started, but do not have significant impact on business operations
3. Low Priority (L) - Tasks that can wait until resources are available if necessary

The key advantage of using prioritization methods is that it allows teams to focus on critical tasks that are essential to achieving goals within specific timeframes, while ignoring less important tasks or those that may take longer than anticipated. This approach helps reduce waste in both time and effort as well as improve overall efficiency and effectiveness. 

### Business Case （业务价值）
Business cases provide a crucial input into any prioritization process. They define the context, requirements, objectives, and strategy of an organization's mission, as well as its future strategies. In general, they outline what the organization intends to achieve, why this particular initiative/program has been chosen, and what benefits will result from implementing it successfully. Once identified, these case studies should be used by management to help determine which projects or activities most closely align with the strategic plans of the enterprise. 

### Criticality Analysis （关键性分析）
Criticality analysis involves identifying the relative criticality of various activities or functions within an organization. These analyses are designed to identify areas where potential bottlenecks or congestions could occur, thus requiring more targeted attention and action. By analyzing the likelihood of delays or failures, organizations can make better-informed decisions regarding how to allocate limited resources to meet critical needs first, rather than waiting for additional resources to become available. 

### Risk Management （风险管理）
Risk management refers to a structured approach to assessing, managing, and mitigating risk throughout an organization. It includes analyzing existing risks, developing mitigation strategies, and communicating clear expectations about potential threats and vulnerabilities. Risk management plays an integral role in prioritizing projects because it provides a framework for decision making related to budgetary, human resource, and other constraints that limit the ability of an organization to execute on all projects simultaneously.

### Competitive Intelligence （竞争优势）
Competitive Intelligence describes the collective view of an industry that represents the views and practices of many stakeholders within a company. It enables organizations to understand the strengths and weaknesses of competitors, monitor trends in technology, and gauge market share and competition. Competitive Intelligence plays a crucial role in determining which projects are likely to succeed and which ones will fail.

### Project Dependencies （项目依赖关系）
Project dependencies describe the interrelationships between different projects, allowing organizations to gain a deeper understanding of the relationships among various components of a project. By analyzing these relationships, organizations can better manage resources, avoid duplication of efforts, and prevent unexpected consequences when changes are made to one part of a system.

# 3.Algorithm Overview & Steps 
## Step 1: Understand the Problem Statement
To develop a good prioritization plan, we need to understand our business problem clearly. We also need to explore possible solutions to the problem. Identifying the target audience, customer segments, product or service needs, and user experience is another crucial aspect of understanding the problem statement.

## Step 2: Develop Business Case
We then gather data from various sources such as surveys, interviews, and user feedback to develop a detailed business case. Our objective is to understand who we are trying to serve, what they want, and why. To create a strong business case, we start by answering these questions:

1. Who are your customers? What are their pain points? How do you address them today? 

2. Why does your current business model fall short in terms of revenue growth, profitability, or profit margins? How can you increase your chances of success?

3. What new product or service features would enhance your brand position, sales, and profitability?

4. How can you deliver value to users quickly and efficiently without compromising on quality or security?

Based on the answers obtained from the survey, we formulate a hypothesis that explains why certain actions or initiatives should be focused on over others. For example, “Adding a feature X increases conversion rates by Y%”. By working together with relevant stakeholders, we refine the hypotheses and come up with a thorough business case that defines the problems and benefits of each proposal.

## Step 3: Determine Key Projects
Next, we need to select the key projects or initiatives that are needed to solve the given problem. These projects will represent the most critical elements of our business and will directly affect our bottom line. A solid prioritization plan requires us to evaluate several factors, including scope, time frame, budget, cost, and priority. Therefore, we need to carefully consider the criteria and choose the right metric(s) to measure these factors.

Once selected, we proceed to analyze the criticality of the project and assign it a rating out of five (from highly critical to very non-critical). Each rating corresponds to an appropriate priority level, which we apply to each project accordingly. 

## Step 4: Conduct Risk Analyses
Risk management is a vital component of any prioritization process. It ensures that there are no unnecessary risks involved during execution and serves as a catalyst for actionable insights for improving outcomes. We begin by conducting a risk assessment to identify risks associated with the key projects.

A risk assessment consists of two steps: identifying the possible risks and evaluating the probability and severity of each risk. Here’s a sample questionnaire for conducting a risk assessment:

*What type of risks exist in your business?*

This question identifies the nature of the risk. Common types include loss of revenue due to product failure; data breaches leading to identity fraud; unauthorized access to sensitive information; customer complaints resulting in negative ratings; employee turnover and attrition due to poor performance; legal liability related to intellectual property rights violation; technical challenges in adapting to new technologies; etc.

*How likely are these risks to occur?*

Probability indicates the likelihood that the risk will materialize. The higher the probability, the greater the risk. Common probabilities range from extremely unlikely (almost impossible) to extremely probable (an everyday occurrence).

*What is the severity of these risks?*

Severity indicates the potential damage caused by the risk. Common severities include minor (e.g., data breaches); medium (e.g., financial losses or legal penalties); major (e.g., loss of profits or customer dissatisfaction).

By analyzing the risks and considering the probability and severity, we establish a baseline against which we can compare the realistic possibility of a project’s completion. If a project seems too risky compared to its feasibility, we can temporarily drop its priority level or discard it altogether. Alternatively, we can seek alternative approaches or partner with external entities to ensure adequate insurance coverage.

## Step 5: Gather Competitive Intelligence
Competitive Intelligence plays a pivotal role in helping organizations prioritize projects effectively. We use various metrics such as market share, earnings per share, market size, brand recognition, consumer sentiment, and customer loyalty to obtain valuable insights into the competitive landscape of the industry. Based on this information, we categorize companies into four distinct sectors:

1. Tech Sector – Organizations building technology-based businesses such as big data analytics, cloud computing, machine learning, and blockchain applications.

2. Finance Sector – Organizations providing financial services such as banking, credit card, mortgage lending, and securities trading.

3. Healthcare Sector – Organizations providing health care services such as medical devices, diagnosis software, and personal health assistants.

4. Manufacturing Sector – Organizations manufacturing goods, services, and energy such as automobiles, electronics, mining equipment, and industrial products.

We use this knowledge to allocate resources towards the sector(s) that offer the highest ROI to our clients. Additionally, we observe patterns across various sectors and apply similar ranking mechanisms to identify the dominant players.

## Step 6: Analyze Project Dependencies
Another factor that influences prioritization is the relationship between multiple projects. When two or more projects depend on each other, it becomes increasingly difficult to complete them independently. A common method to deal with this issue is called Waterfall Model. It assumes that all phases of development happen in a linear sequence, with no overlapping or branching paths. However, this approach often fails to capture complex interactions among projects and forces developers to delay tasks until previous stages are complete.

In contrast, Agile Model promotes iterative cycles of development, allowing teams to adjust course according to changing priorities and customer feedback. Teams break down large projects into smaller, more manageable chunks and regularly communicate progress and blockers through sprints. Despite its simplicity, Agile Model is widely adopted by top tech companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Netflix.

Using Agile Model, we can analyze the dependency structure among projects and rank them accordingly. Specifically, we can review the complexity and difficulty of each task, along with the dependencies on other tasks, to estimate their relative difficulty and duration. With this information, we can assign a priority level to each task that reflects its significance, relative deadline, and importance to the client’s business.
