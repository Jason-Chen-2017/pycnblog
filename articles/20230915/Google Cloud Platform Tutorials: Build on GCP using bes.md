# 1.简介
  

The tutorial series is designed to provide an overview of how developers can build on top of the powerful Google Cloud platform and take advantage of its many features such as machine learning capabilities, scalability, high availability, and security built-in. It starts by introducing you to some basic concepts related to cloud computing like virtual machines, storage options, networking, and more importantly, provides a step-by-step guide on building applications on GCP. By the end of this article, you will have gained an understanding of different services available in GCP, their use cases, pricing plans, and deployment models that help you get started quickly with your projects. The next part of the tutorials will cover advanced topics such as application monitoring, performance optimization techniques, design patterns, and scaling strategies to help you scale up or down your project as per your needs. Finally, we will dive into the core components of GCP like BigQuery, Datastore, PubSub, Compute Engine, Kubernetes Engine, and Cloud Functions. 

This tutorial series aims to provide essential information for those who want to learn about GCP and build solutions leveraging its powerful features. It covers various aspects ranging from fundamental cloud computing principles to advanced machine learning techniques. We hope this article series will be useful to everyone interested in exploring GCP as a potential tool for development and beyond. Let’s begin... 


# 2. 核心技术术语及简单介绍
Before we move ahead with the actual content of our articles, let's first clarify some key terms used throughout these tutorials. Here are some commonly used terms that may not be familiar to all readers:

1. **Cloud**: A cloud computing service provided by a third party provider, where users pay a subscription fee based on the resources they consume. There are several types of clouds including public, private, hybrid, and multi-cloud. In this tutorial series, we focus solely on Public Cloud offerings because it is easier to access than traditional data centers. 

2. **VM**: Virtual Machine (VM), also known as Instance, is a software program that operates like a physical computer but runs on a shared resource pool rather than dedicated hardware. VMs run on top of physical servers within a data center. They usually consist of an operating system, processor(CPU), memory, network interface cards (NICs), hard disk drives (HDDs), and video cards. Virtually any software can be installed on a VM, allowing developers to create custom environments suited to specific workloads. 

3. **Container**: Containers are lightweight and portable encapsulations of an app or environment that contain everything needed to execute it. Unlike VMs which require entire OS images, containers share only necessary libraries and binaries, making them much smaller and more efficient. Docker is the most popular containerization technology and tools like Docker Compose can automate the process of deploying multiple containers on a single host. 

4. **Storage**: Storage refers to both long term storage such as disks, SSDs, or persistent volumes, as well as short term temporary storage such as memory cache or ephemeral disks. Cloud providers often charge different rates for each type of storage, so it is important to choose the right option depending on the expected usage pattern. 

5. **Networking**: Networking refers to connecting devices over a communication channel such as internet, LAN, WAN, etc., enabling interaction between them. There are two main ways to connect cloud resources - IaaS or PaaS, Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service respectively. Regardless of whether you opt for IaaS or PaaS, there are different networking technologies at play such as VPCs, firewall rules, load balancers, DNS, and VPN tunnels.  

6. **Load Balancing**: Load balancing involves distributing incoming traffic across multiple instances of a service or server, ensuring that the workload is evenly distributed amongst all the available resources. This helps prevent overload and ensure consistent response times for clients. Different load balancing technologies such as Application/Network Load Balancer, Internal Load Balancer, and Global Load Balancer can be used depending on your requirements.  

7. **Compute Engine**: Compute engine provides a managed instance group that allows developers to launch virtual machines rapidly and easily. Users specify CPU cores, amount of RAM, and other specifications like GPU or preemptible instances to optimize cost and improve availability. Compute engine offers automatic scaling capabilities, allowing users to adjust capacity according to demand without interruption. 

8. **Kubernetes Engine**: Kubernetes Engine is a fully managed container orchestration solution that automates the management and operations of containerized applications across a cluster of nodes. It offers easy clustering, auto-scaling, self-healing, and rollout management. Developers can deploy containerized applications directly through Kubernetes Engine, integrate with external systems, and manage infrastructure with ease.

9. **Big Query**: Big Query is a petabyte-scale data warehouse hosted on GCP that enables SQL-based querying and analysis of massive datasets stored in large tables. Big query supports integration with external sources like Hadoop clusters, Apache Hive, HBase, and Cloud Storage, providing a complete analytics and BI solution. 

 
10. **Datastore**: Datastore is a NoSQL database offered by GCP. It supports structured and unstructured data, replication and horizontal scaling, and offers eventual consistency for read queries. Developers can store data efficiently and retrieve it quickly, making it ideal for applications requiring fast and reliable access to big sets of data. 

11. **Pubsub**: Pubsub is a messaging service that allows publishers to push messages to subscribers for asynchronous processing. Subscribers receive messages as soon as they are published, minimizing delays and achieving higher throughput compared to queue-based approaches. Pubsub has been widely adopted by GCP for real-time messaging scenarios like IoT events, logging, and streaming data.  

With the above introduction, let us now look at the overall structure of each tutorial. Each tutorial will start with a brief explanation followed by hands-on exercises to help readers understand and apply the material learned in each section.
