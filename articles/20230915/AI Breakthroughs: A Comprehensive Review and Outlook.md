Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as one of the most significant innovations over the last decade or so, having revolutionized various fields from medicine to finance. With rapid advancement in machine learning technologies and computational power, artificial intelligence is now being used across a wide range of industries such as healthcare, finance, retail, transportation, etc., with applications ranging from self-driving cars to speech recognition systems. 

As we all know that any technology can only be successful if it is adopted by people as widely as possible. Therefore, public awareness, education, training, and access to resources are critical factors for society's future development towards the goal of human-level intelligent machines. This review article aims at providing an overview of the latest advances in Artificial Intelligence technologies and highlight their significance for achieving this goal. The focus will be on understanding how these technologies have transformed our lives and changed the world around us.

# 2.定义、术语及解释
## 2.1 Artificial Intelligence Definition
Artificial Intelligence (AI), also known as Machine Learning (ML), is the field of computer science concerned with constructing machines that exhibit some degree of human intelligence. It involves designing algorithms and models that learn through experience, and then apply learned knowledge to make predictions or decisions. In simpler terms, AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that mimic their behavior and actions using software rather than natural language processing techniques. This includes tasks like image recognition, voice recognition, chatbots, and decision-making processes based on data analysis.

In the early days of AI research, many machine learning algorithms were developed without considering issues related to ethical aspects such as bias and fairness. Today, however, there exists numerous social and legal issues associated with the use of AI technology. These include privacy concerns, security threats, and risks of bias and discrimination. To address these challenges, governments and organizations need to establish clear guidelines and policies before introducing advanced technologies into daily life.

## 2.2 Types of AI Technology
There are several types of AI technologies available today, which differ in terms of their level of complexity and approach.

1. Supervised Learning: In supervised learning, the algorithm learns by example, i.e., it trains itself to recognize patterns in labeled input data. The algorithm uses feedback received after making a prediction to improve its performance over time, eventually leading to increased accuracy and robustness. One type of supervised learning technique is classification, where the output variable is categorical. For instance, spam detection is a common application of supervised learning in email filtering. 

2. Unsupervised Learning: In unsupervised learning, the algorithm identifies hidden patterns within unlabeled input data. Unlike supervised learning, no labels are provided during the training process, instead relying solely on the features extracted from the data. One popular application of unsupervised learning is clustering, where the algorithm groups similar inputs together into clusters. Clustering can help organize large amounts of unstructured data into meaningful subsets.

3. Reinforcement Learning: In reinforcement learning, the algorithm interacts with an environment and receives rewards or penalties depending on its actions. The objective of the algorithm is to maximize cumulative reward in an uncertain environment. Reinforcement learning can be applied in domains such as game playing, robotics, and autonomous driving.

4. Deep Learning: Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that utilizes neural networks to perform complex tasks. Neural networks consist of interconnected layers of nodes, each representing an activation function computed on weighted inputs. Traditional deep learning algorithms typically require massive datasets to train and often take long periods of time to converge due to vanishing gradients. However, recent developments in deep learning algorithms such as transfer learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and attention mechanisms have led to breakthroughs in a wide variety of applications.

## 2.3 Common Terms and Concepts
### Terminology
1. Data: Data is a collection of facts and figures that provide information about past, present, or future events. Collectively, it forms the basis of artificial intelligence systems.

2. Algorithm: An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or performing a task. Almost every modern day computing system relies heavily on algorithms to carry out operations efficiently.

3. Computer Vision: Computer vision involves enabling computers to perceive, understand, and manipulate digital images, videos, and other visual content. The key challenge here lies in developing effective methods of analyzing and manipulating such content.

4. Natural Language Processing: Natural language processing (NLP) involves the ability of computers to understand, analyze, and generate human language. NLP enables computers to understand and communicate with humans in natural languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, and Chinese.

5. Speech Recognition: Speech recognition involves translating spoken words into text format. It is commonly used in speech-based interfaces, mobile phone apps, and virtual assistants. There are several approaches to speech recognition, including Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Bayesian Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

6. Knowledge Graphs: Knowledge graphs are semantic networks consisting of entities and relationships between them. They enable the creation of powerful search engines and recommendation systems. Examples of knowledge graph applications include Google Search, Facebook, Netflix, and Amazon.

7. Robotics: Robotics is the branch of engineering that deals with building and programming machines that can move independently and work collaboratively to accomplish challenging tasks. Robotics covers a wide range of areas, including mechanical design, control theory, computer architecture, motion planning, path planning, navigation, perception, cognition, and electronics.

8. Artificial General Intelligence: Artificial general intelligence (AGI) involves creating machines that can think, feel, reason, plan, learn, and act like humans. While not yet achieved, traditional AI researchers believe that artificial general intelligence will transform the way we live, work, and play. Currently, the primary challenge is to create machines capable of understanding and generating human-like thoughts and behaviors.

### Core Concepts
1. Agent: Agents are autonomous entities that interact with the outside world. They may behave according to rules they receive from their owners, receive instructions from other agents, or interact with the physical environment. Some examples of agent-based modeling include traffic management systems, supply chain logistics, and grid computing platforms.

2. Reasoning: Reasoning involves extracting meaningful information from data. When two parties want to negotiate a contract, the reasons behind those choices can be analyzed using logic. Similarly, when a machine must decide what to do given new observations, it makes sense to encode these concepts using logical inference.

3. Formalization: Formalization is a process of structuring ideas in mathematical formulas. It allows expertise to be captured in formal representations that can be easily understood by others. Logic and mathematics provide foundational principles of formalization in AI, allowing systems to represent knowledge as sets of equations and constraints, and reason about relationships among variables.

4. Optimization: Optimization is the process of finding the best solution to a problem under certain conditions. In AI, optimization plays a crucial role in selecting the optimal set of actions or hyperparameters for different tasks. In contrast to traditional optimization problems, which involve minimizing or maximizing a single scalar value, AI optimization requires optimizing complex functions that depend on multiple parameters simultaneously.

5. Planning: Planning involves specifying goals, predicting outcomes, anticipating risks, and allocating limited resources to achieve desired objectives. In AI, planning helps to identify feasible paths to reach goals while avoiding risk.

6. Learning: Learning involves teaching machines to extract useful insights from data by gradually improving performance. In supervised learning, the algorithm learns to map input data to expected outputs. Similarly, unsupervised learning explores input data to find patterns and group similar instances together.

7. Conversational Systems: Conversational systems are automated tools that allow users to interact with services via voice, text, and visual interfaces. They respond to user queries by producing relevant responses in real-time, making conversational AI important for businesses and industry 4.0.

8. Causality: Causality represents the relationship between cause and effect. It describes the flow of influence and dependencies amongst variables in a complex network. It is essential in AI because it enables systems to make confident predictions, explore alternative scenarios, and anticipate impacts of changes.
