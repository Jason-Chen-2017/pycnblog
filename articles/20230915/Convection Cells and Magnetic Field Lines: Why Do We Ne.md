# 1.简介
  

Fluid flow is the basic phenomenon that brings different materials together in a unified fluid environment. It has become one of the most important issues in engineering practice because it affects many industries such as water treatment, geology, mining, energy production, transportation, chemical industry, food processing, etc. In this article, we will briefly introduce some fundamental concepts related to fluid flow, including velocity, pressure, temperature, density, viscosity, heat transfer, vapour diffusion, condensation, mass transfer, and turbulence. Then, we will discuss the history of convection cells and magnetic field lines, which are two key components of fluid flows. Finally, we will summarize what we have learned from these two historical events and identify future challenges and directions for research.

### 2.1.1 概念
Fluid flow refers to the movement or distribution of matter through space and time. In order to understand fluid flow, we need to know its basic principles, including velocity (v), pressure (p), temperature (T), density (ρ), viscosity (μ), heat transfer (q), vapour diffusion (ν), condensation (K), mass transfer (m), and turbulence (τ). These characteristics determine how and where the fluid flows through a medium and influence various physical properties such as shape, structure, behavior, etc., thereby affecting overall system performance and efficiency. Overall, fluid flow plays an essential role in shaping our world around us and providing opportunities for numerous applications ranging from chemistry to medicine. 

Fluid flow is mainly divided into two main types: laminar and turbulent flows. Laminar flows involve uniform motion with constant speed throughout the domain while turbulent flows exhibit strong variations in speed, direction, and range along the flow path. Turbulent flows can be categorized into three sub-types: kinetic energy cascade (KEC), wave boundary layer (WBL) and eddy current layers (ECL). The main difference between each type is their reconnection rate, the rate at which they switch back to the mean flow and unstabilize, respectively. A more detailed explanation about fluid flow is beyond the scope of this article. However, based on our understanding of laminar and turbulent flows, we can classify them into two categories: convection flows and diffusion flows. Convection flows typically involve a high degree of buoyancy and result from the presence of convective forces acting on objects. Diffusion flows, on the other hand, are characterized by low Reynolds numbers and small differences in shapes, making them ideal for large-scale transportation of solid particles. For now, let's focus on convection flows.

In general, convection cells refer to the region near the surface of a fluid where wind velocities produce heat fluxes and generate moving air masses. Convection cells exist both in open and closed regions of the fluid, but they usually consist of a restricted area within which a balance of heat generation and advection takes place. Convections take place due to multiple factors such as buoyancy, frictional effects, radiation, and pressure gradients. When the air around the convection cell experiences considerable pressures and generates a steady state of fluid temperature, the surrounding material becomes bubbly or conductive. This process of expansion and contraction of fluid inside a convection cell is called convection. There are several kinds of convection cells, including shock waves, rotating buoys, or cumuliform clouds. As mentioned earlier, convection cells play a crucial role in shaping the overall structure and geometry of fluid flows. Therefore, it is necessary to understand how they work and how they interact with other structures and processes in order to develop new designs and improve existing ones.

Magnetic field lines, also known as streamlines or electric field lines, are curves in fluid flow that propagate outward from a source point until they reach a sink point. They represent the magnetic fields generated by fluid flow and provide information regarding the orientation and magnitude of the flow. Magnetic field lines can help scientists gain insights into fluid flows and the interactions between fluids and surfaces, particularly when combined with imaging techniques like X-ray tomography. With their ability to monitor complex fluid systems over large distances, magnetic field lines make up another critical component of fluid flow science.

Based on the above concepts, we can create an abstract model of fluid flow by introducing the following key points: 

1. Fluid flow consists of convection and diffusion;

2. Convection cells form in narrow regions of the fluid with high pressures and stable temperatures;

3. Convection occurs due to a wide range of reasons such as buoyancy, friction, pressure gradient, and thermal fluctuations;

4. Magnetic field lines propagate away from a source point and indicate the direction and strength of fluid flow;

5. The intersection of magnetic field lines and convection cells creates filamentary structures.

These concepts and ideas are only scratching the surface of fluid flow and require further investigation and development in order to fully understand and control it. Here are some interesting links for further reading:
