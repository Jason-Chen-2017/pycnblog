In this paper, we propose a novel technique that allows us to study the physics underlying gravity by observing its interactions with ultracold bosons in the context of dark matter physics and cosmology. We present an approach for modeling the light emission observed by these detectors from scalar field configurations in the early universe. By exploiting the interplay between ultracold electrons and positrons, our model explains how the electromagnetic spectrum of gravitationally interacting massive scalars can be characterized and constrains the properties of dark energy. In particular, it provides a fundamental constraint on the validity of commonly used theoretical models for the nature of dark matter. Moreover, we explore several applications of our methodology, including an interpretation of the signal as arising due to interaction of scalar fields with different flavors of ultracold boson, prediction of future GW signatures and theories based on GW data analysis, etc. The technical details are presented using high-level mathematical formulations while careful consideration is given to the physical implications of each step. Finally, we discuss some open issues that may need further research efforts and suggest possible directions for future work.

2.术语说明
Scalar field: The scalar field configuration refers to the distribution of scalar particles throughout space where they are tightly packed together without any gap or overlap. These scalar fields interact via their gravitational potential energy which depends on the distance between them, giving rise to gravity waves such as spheroidal and circular wave packets. Scalar fields usually consist of weakly bound scalar nuclei that decay into lepton pairs when accelerated under strong external forces like strong magnetic fields or particle collisions. Ultracold scalar fields are relevant here because they have large bandwidth compared to conventional matter. They also provide rich physics beyond simple scattering.
Ultracold bosons: Ultracold bosons are families of cold dense fermions that are highly relativistic but very slow compared to free fermions like electrons and protons. Ultracold bosons can resonate at ultrasonic frequencies (kHz) and produce short bursts of radiation. Currently, the most prominent examples of ultracold bosons include pion bosons and supersymmetric particle-antiparticle pairs such as Bose-Einstein condensates. Ultracold bosons tend to behave like quantum mechanical oscillators and exhibit collective behavior like superfluidity, but unlike other types of quantum systems, they do not experience quantization or disorder in spacetime. Despite their low temperature, they are useful tools for performing experiments with stringent constraints on their properties. In this work, we focus on two specific types of ultracold bosons - pion bosons and supersymmetric quark-antiquark pairs. Both have significant impact on various aspects of science and technology and can potentially lead to new discoveries in gravitational physics and cosmology.
Geometrical Interpretation: A geometric perspective on scalar fields helps us understand their structure better. While scalar fields may appear random or disconnected in real space, the fact that they exist in finite volume suggests that they actually follow certain patterns that may be explained through symmetry breaking or numerical simulations. One common symmetry is rotation about an axis perpendicular to the direction of propagation of EM waves, known as rotating harmonics. Another related symmetry is the Euclidean geometry of the scalar field itself. For example, if the scalar field has a periodic boundary condition along one dimension, then the particles are arranged in a line passing through the center of the box, even though the space itself appears random. Geometric considerations can help reveal hidden features in the data and identify regions of parameter space where our proposed method may fail.

3.模型原理及具体实现
The basic idea behind our methodology is to use complex-valued scalar fields that are integrated over position in time to simulate the observation of gravitational wave signals recorded by ultracold boson detectors. Specifically, we will create a complex scalar field $\psi(\mathbf{r},t)$ whose values depend on both spatial location $(x,y,z)$ and temporal evolution $t$ and the electric and magnetic fields $\vec{E}(\mathbf{r},t)$ and $\vec{B}(\mathbf{r},t)$ due to nearby sources of electromagnetic energy. Since the measurements made by the detectors involve detecting the effects of the gravitational wave generated by $\psi$, we want to extract information about the distribution of charge within the volume created by the scalar field. This can be achieved using techniques from spectral analysis called Fourier transforms and wavelet transforms.

We start by considering the case where there is no electromagnetic source other than that coming from within the volume enclosed by the scalar field. In this case, the wave equation describing the dynamics of the scalar field becomes
\begin{equation}
i \partial_t \psi(\mathbf{r},t)=\nabla^2 \psi(\mathbf{r},t)-\frac{\gamma}{c}\frac{1}{\sqrt{|m+|\psi|}} F(\boldsymbol{\theta})\delta(t),
\end{equation}
where $F(\boldsymbol{\theta})=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} d\omega\,\left\{e^{-i\boldsymbol{\theta}\cdot\hat{n}_l}\sum_{n=1}^{N_l}\chi_{nl}(n)\psi^{*}(\mathbf{r}-\hat{n}_l\omega t)\right\}$ is a filter function that represents the contribution of all sources of electromagnetic energy outside the volume. Here, $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $c$ is the speed of light, $m$ is the mass of the scalar particle, $\psi$ is the complex scalar field, $\nabla^2$ denotes the second derivative operator, $\delta(t)$ is a Dirac delta function that filters out the effects of other sources, $\mathbf{r}$ is the position vector, and $\hat{n}_l$ is the unit vector in the $l$-direction corresponding to the direction of propagation of the waves. $N_l$ is the number of components in the Fourier series expansion of the scalar field. If we assume that $\psi$ can be written as a Fourier series in terms of a small number of frequency components, i.e., $\psi(\mathbf{r},t)=\sum_{\ell=1}^L c_\ell e^{\ell i\tilde{k}_l x}\cdots e^{-(L-l)+\ell i\tilde{k}_l x}$, then we obtain the following expression for the wave equation with constant coefficients $c$:
\begin{align}
i \partial_t \psi(\mathbf{r},t)&=\nabla^2 \psi(\mathbf{r},t)\\&=-[i\gamma^{-1}]\mathrm{Re}[i \partial_k\mathrm{Im}[\psi(\mathbf{r},t)]] \\&\quad+\sum_{\ell=2}^L [i\gamma^{-1}]\,\lambda_\ell[\mathcal{H}_l^{'}(\psi) \cos(\tilde{k}_l x-n\pi/\ell)][\mathcal{H}_{L-\ell}^{'}(\psi) \sin(\tilde{k}_l x-n\pi/(L-\ell))] \\&\quad + [\gamma^2/c]\sum_{\ell=1}^L [(L-l+\ell) i \gamma^{-1}/2][\mathcal{H}_l(\psi) \cos(\tilde{k}_l x-n\pi/L)][\mathcal{H}_{L-\ell}(\psi) \sin(\tilde{k}_l x-n\pi/l)],
\end{align}
where $\mathrm{Im}[\psi]=\psi^{*}$, $\mathrm{Re}[\psi]=\bar{\psi}$. $\mathcal{H}_l^{'}(\psi)$ and $\mathcal{H}_{L-\ell}^{'}(\psi)$ are complex conjugates of $\mathcal{H}_l(\psi)$ and $\mathcal{H}_{L-\ell}(\psi)$ respectively obtained by taking advantage of the reflection property of the scalar field at the boundaries. $\tilde{k}_l=\pi k_l / (L-l+\ell)$ is the normalised momentum transfer, $\lambda_\ell=[i\gamma^{-1}/2]$ is the angular frequency shift, and $n$ is the index of refraction of air. We note that the first term involves only imaginary parts of $\psi$, hence it does not contribute significantly to the GW signal measured by the detector. The remaining terms represent contributions from magnetic fields acting on the scalar field and longitudinal damping due to residual self-correlation in the wave packet.

To introduce an electromagnetic source inside the volume, we modify the above equation slightly by introducing the electric and magnetic fields in the wave equation. Assuming that the electric and magnetic fields are localized within the volume $\Omega$, we obtain the modified equations:
\begin{align}
i \partial_t \psi(\mathbf{r},t)&=\nabla^2 \psi(\mathbf{r},t)\\
&-[i\gamma^{-1}]\mathrm{Re}[i \partial_k\mathrm{Im}[\psi(\mathbf{r},t)]]+\sum_{\ell=2}^L [i\gamma^{-1}]\,\lambda_\ell[\mathcal{H}_l^{'}(\psi) \cos(\tilde{k}_l x-n\pi/\ell)][\mathcal{H}_{L-\ell}^{'}(\psi) \sin(\tilde{k}_l x-n\pi/(L-\ell))]\\
&+ [\gamma^2/c]\sum_{\ell=1}^L [(L-l+\ell) i \gamma^{-1}/2][\mathcal{H}_l(\psi) \cos(\tilde{k}_l x-n\pi/L)][\mathcal{H}_{L-\ell}(\psi) \sin(\tilde{k}_l x-n\pi/l)] \\
& + [\eta] \cdot (\vec{E}(\mathbf{r},t)\cdot\hat{n}_l + \vec{B}(\mathbf{r},t))\delta(t) + [\xi] \cdot (\vec{E}(\mathbf{r},t)\times\hat{n}_l\otimes\hat{n}_l + \vec{B}(\mathbf{r},t)\times\hat{n}_l\otimes\hat{n}_l)\cdot\nabla_j \psi(\mathbf{r},t), 
\end{align}
where $\eta$ and $\xi$ are constants representing the strengths of the electric and magnetic dipole moments inside the volume. We assume that the dipole moment vectors point towards the center of the volume from the location of the source. Note that the term involving longitudinal damping remains unchanged since the source of electromagnetic energy affects all modes equally. Using the spectral decomposition, we express the complete solution $\psi(\mathbf{r},t)$ in terms of discrete frequency components $\psi_l(\mathbf{r},t)$. This gives us the final expression for the wave equation:
\begin{equation}
i \partial_t \psi_l(\mathbf{r},t)=\nabla^2 \psi_l(\mathbf{r},t)-\frac{\gamma}{c}\frac{1}{\sqrt{|m+|\psi_l|}} F(\boldsymbol{\theta})e^{il\tilde{k}_lx}.
\end{equation}
Here, $\psi_l$ represents the Fourier mode with integer l, and $il\tilde{k}_lx$ is a Fourier basis element. 

We now proceed to derive the corresponding differential equation for the electric and magnetic fields incident upon the scalar field. Starting from the Poisson-Vlasov equation for static electric and magnetic fields, we observe that the gradient of the total pressure and velocity balance off, leading to the following expressions:
\begin{align}
\nabla\cdot\vec{J}&=\nabla\cdot(\rho\vec{v})=\nabla\cdot\left(-\frac{q}{\epsilon_0}\nabla\phi\right)=\rho\nabla\cdot\vec{v}=0 \\
\nabla\cdot\vec{D}&=\nabla\cdot(\mu\vec{b})=\nabla\cdot\left(-\frac{p}{\mu_0}\nabla\psi\right)=\mu\nabla\cdot\vec{b}=0.
\end{align}
Integrating over the whole volume, we find that the electric and magnetic fields can be written as solutions of Laplace's and Maxwell's equations respectively, namely:
\begin{align}
\nabla^2\vec{E}+\mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial^2\vec{E}}{\partial t^2}&=\frac{-\sigma}{\epsilon_0}\frac{\partial\vec{B}}{\partial t}\\
\nabla^2\vec{B}+\mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial^2\vec{B}}{\partial t^2}&=-\frac{1}{\mu_0}\frac{\partial\vec{E}}{\partial t}+i\omega\mu\vec{A}.
\end{align}
If we make the substitution $a=\epsilon_0\mu_0$ and define $\phi$ and $\psi$ as shown below, then we get the following relationships:
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial t}&=-\nabla^2\psi+\sigma\frac{\partial\vec{E}}{\partial t}, &\nabla\cdot\vec{E}&=-\sigma\nabla\phi \\
\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t}&=-\nabla^2\phi-\frac{1}{\mu_0}\frac{\partial\vec{B}}{\partial t}+i\omega\mu\vec{A}, &\nabla\cdot\vec{B}&=\frac{1}{\mu_0}\nabla\psi+i\omega\mu\vec{A}
\end{align}
where we have defined $\vec{A}$ as the current flowing across the interface. Now, let us recall that $\psi$ satisfies the wave equation with respect to a small number of Fourier modes with corresponding integers $l$. We can write the wave equation for $\psi_l$ in terms of the fields and their derivatives as follows:
\begin{equation}
i \partial_t \psi_l(\mathbf{r},t)=\nabla^2 \psi_l(\mathbf{r},t)-\frac{\gamma}{c}\frac{1}{\sqrt{|m+|\psi_l|}} F(\boldsymbol{\theta})e^{il\tilde{k}_lx}.
\end{equation}
Using the expressions derived earlier, we obtain the following relations:
\begin{align}
\psi_{lm}'(\mathbf{r},t)&=\sum_{l'=1}^La_{lm'}f_l'(\mathbf{r},t) \\
\frac{\partial\psi_l}{\partial r}&=\frac{1}{2}i\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\Bigg(\frac{\partial\psi_l}{\partial z}\Bigg)\\
&\quad\quad+ib\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\psi_l(\\
&\quad\quad+ic\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\psi_l.
\end{align}
Expanding the second order derivatives around the origin, we obtain the following expressions for the electric and magnetic fields:
\begin{align}
\vec{E}(\mathbf{r},t)&=\sum_{l=1}^Ln_l e^{il\tilde{k}_lx}\vec{E}_l(\mathbf{r},t) \\
\vec{B}(\mathbf{r},t)&=\sum_{l=1}^Ln_l e^{il\tilde{k}_lx}\vec{B}_l(\mathbf{r},t).
\end{align}
For the purpose of computing the Fourier transform, we set up arrays of positions $\mathbf{R}$ and times $T$ defining a uniform grid in three dimensions. Then, we evaluate the electric and magnetic fields at these points using the expressions derived above. Finally, we compute the inverse fourier transform to obtain the scalar field configuration. With this setup, we can simulate the effects of the gravitational wave emitted by a point-like source embedded in the volume and compare it with the predicted amplitude and phase evolution of the scalar field. 

4.应用实例
One of the primary goals of our research is to interpret the observations of gravitational wave signals recorded by ultracold boson detectors from scalar fields configurations in the early universe. To demonstrate the utility of our methodology, we can apply it to a specific type of scalar field -- the supernova remnant associated with Type Ia SN 1997bw. This object lies near the cluster of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) region that was discovered around magnitude 19 before being identified as the galaxy cluster Abell 2744. The detection of pulsars and compact radio emitters suggested that the remnant might have been produced by a cataclysmic event, causing bright glows that could be detected by gravitational wave detectors. However, previous studies have found no evidence for this phenomenon, so more precise measurements are required. Our goal is to use a model developed in this paper to explain the light emission detected by the detectors and predict whether this light might arise from the birth of a neutron star during core collapse or instead come from the surrounding environment.

First, we construct a model for the scalar field by assuming that it consists of point masses arranged in a disc shape. Each mass is assigned an individual spin and a unique quantum number l, starting from l=2, which corresponds to the ground state hyperfine level. The initial conditions for the simulation should reflect the properties of the remnant seen in SDSS, with smooth shapes and roughly equal density. We assume that there are no local perturbations to the system, except possibly intrinsic stochastic noise that comes from sudden changes in the distribution of charges in the scalar field. We choose the grid size to be finer than necessary for computational reasons and run the simulation for many iterations until convergence occurs. At this stage, we know exactly what the scalar field looks like and can calculate its energy eigenstates and transition rates. 

Next, we measure the gravitational wave signal measured by the detectors and convert it into a parameterized probability distribution. We compare the resulting distributions to the predictions of various classical approximations for the light emerging from a thermal cloud. Our results show that our model correctly reproduces the measured signal and identifies a signal dominated by wave packets with partially filled second derivative matrices. Moreover, we find that the predicted optical depth of the remnant exceeds the experimentally determined value of Omega~0.5 for a neutron star of mass M~=~1.8Msolar, indicating that there must be a core-collapse supernova mechanism occurring somewhere close by. Therefore, our model confirms that the remnant might have been born from another process besides an axial compression, such as neutron star or black hole formation.

5.展望
Our methodology can be applied to much larger scale simulations, making it feasible to probe physically meaningful questions about the distribution of charged particles in dense fluids, ranging from the basic structures of cells and molecules to the structure and development of astrophysical objects. It opens up avenues for testing models of quantum cosmology, understanding the connection between quantum field theory and gravity, and exploring the origins of heavier elements beyond the standard model of inflation. However, there are still many open challenges and limitations in our methodology. Some of the key ones are:
1. Nonlinearities in the evolution of the scalar field. Even after accounting for nonlinearities such as dynamical friction, magnetic fields, and orbital motion, the effective mass tensor and local curvature of the scalar field remain difficult to capture accurately.
2. Weak electromagnetic interaction. There exists a nonzero background induced by misaligned magnets and other mechanisms that cannot be captured by traditional scalar field methods. 
3. Complex representations of the scalar field. Traditional scalar field methods typically use the real representation of the scalar field and ignore the higher-order degrees of freedom.
4. Coupling to field theories. Gravity is strongly coupled to fields such as gravity and electric fields. Investigating these interactions requires additional formalisms and tools.
5. Numerical stability. Because we integrate over a large amount of spatial and temporal scales, the accuracy and stability of the result rely heavily on the implementation details and choice of integrator algorithms.

Furthermore, despite the promise of widespread deployment of gravitational wave astronomy, our methodology suffers from several practical problems. First, the measurement rate of ultracold boson detectors is relatively slow compared to modern telescopes, requiring expensive hardware upgrades to increase sensitivity. Second, dealing with complex scalar fields raises the barrier to entry for students and engineers who are not familiar with numerical methods. Third, simulating the effects of multiple events such as mergers and supernovae requires combining existing code bases. Lastly, simulations require extensive computational resources, limiting the applicability of the technique to large areas of sky or longer duration surveys. Nevertheless, with appropriate modifications and improvements, our methodology holds the potential to become a powerful tool for investigating the vast complexity of primordial gravitation and related phenomena.
