Algorithmic game theory (AGT) is the study of algorithms and their design for use in games. AGT has many applications ranging from computer science to economics. It provides a unique perspective on how we can develop intelligent decision-making systems that work well in uncertain environments. AGT researchers have been working towards developing more effective models that take into account players' preferences, strategies, actions, outcomes, and payoffs during game play. In this article, I will cover some fundamental concepts in algorithmic game theory such as Nash equilibrium, perfect information, adversarial search, and decentralized optimization problems. 

Combinatorial optimization (CO) refers to techniques used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving each one independently. The goal of combinatorial optimization is to find an optimal solution among all possible solutions generated by the subproblem instances. This process typically involves applying mathematical tools like linear programming or integer programming to find global optima within limited computational resources.

In CO, there are several popular topics related to algorithmic game theory including perfect information games, minimax optimization, and hidden information games. These topics include various methods and algorithms that enable AGT researchers to model different types of games and analyze their behavior under varying conditions. With the help of these methods, AGT researchers can develop new games with enhanced strategic flexibility and playability and enhance existing games through better resource allocation mechanisms. By combining these insights, AGT researchers may be able to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of AI development, healthcare, finance, transportation, energy management, and other industries. 

The objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive introduction to the field of algorithmic game theory and introduce its most important concepts using practical examples. We will begin by exploring Nash equilibria, which are theoretical concepts that describe the best responses that a player could make in a two-player zero-sum game. We will then move on to introducing minimax optimization, a method commonly used in computer chess programs, which finds the optimum strategy for a given position in a game tree recursively. Next, we will look at hidden information games, which require additional knowledge beyond what the opponent knows about the current state of the game. Finally, we will conclude with an overview of advances in recent years that have led to breakthroughs in AGT research. 
# 2.Nash Equilibrium
A Nash equilibrium (NE) is a set of strategies for both players in a two-player zero-sum game that simultaneously achieve maximum individual utilities while also ensuring mutual satisfaction of the game's constraints. An NE exists when no player can gain an increased amount of utility without also losing something essential to their own interest. More formally, a NE is a pair $(s_1^*, s_2^*)$ of pure strategies where $s_i^*$ maximizes $\pi_{i}(s)$ subject to $s_j(x) \leq k$, for all states $x\in X$. Here, $X$ represents the set of states and $\pi_i(s)$ denotes the probability of choosing action $i$ in state $s$. 

For example, consider the following two-player zero-sum game:

Player $i$ chooses between two actions ($a_1$ and $a_2$) in each turn based on her beliefs about the opponent's actions. Action $a_1$ gives $u_1$ units to player $i$, while action $a_2$ gives $u_2$ units to player $i$. Player $i$'s total reward depends only on her chosen action, not on whether she exploited her opponent's weakness. 

$$\max\{u_1+u_2,\; u_1+c\}$$ 

where $c>0$ is a constraint imposed on player $i$. Players $i$ wants to maximize their expected utility over time, but they must also satisfy the constraint on their own benefit. Since it is always beneficial to the second player to try and exploit his first choice before moving on to the other option, the Nash equilibrium occurs when player $i$ chooses either $a_1$ or $a_2$ with equal probabilities, resulting in the following mixed strategy profile:

$$\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)\quad {\text{(mixed strategy)}}$$

This means that regardless of what player $i$ actually plays, they end up playing the same proportion of $a_1$ and $a_2$. Therefore, since neither player benefits significantly from being cooperative, there does not exist any strategic advantage for either player to choose unilaterally. 

On the other hand, if the condition $c=0$ were removed, then the first player would be forced to do better than random by acting greedily every round. However, this violates the second player's constraint, so there is still a Nash equilibrium in this case. 

Similarly, let's examine another two-player game involving betting. Imagine two people who are deciding whether or not to accept a wager on a random coin flip. Each person places a stake on heads or tails and bets against the other person’s decision until the outcome is decided by flipping the coin once. If the coin lands on heads, both parties win their stakes; if it lands on tails, the winner takes back half of their original bet. Formally, let $$p = [p_1, p_2]$$ represent the probabilities of accepting each wager and $$\mu_i = p_i - q + pq_i$$ represent the expected utility for player $i$ assuming they follow protocol described above. Then, the corresponding cournot market clearing condition becomes:

$$\max\{q+\mu_1\;, q+\mu_2\}$$ 

subject to $$p_1p_2 - q > 0$$, where $q$ is the common unit cost. 

Assuming that both players place similar stakes and believe their expected utility functions correctly, the equilibrium is stable because no player should change their plan of action. For instance, if both players accept the same wagers initially, they should continue doing so unless one party refuses after observing the next coin toss.
