Financial literacy (FL) is the ability of individuals to manage their financial situation effectively, with a view to avoiding unnecessary stress on their lifestyle or relationships. The National Institute of Technology (NIT) and Merit Systems International Pvt Ltd (MSI), together launched a survey for measuring financial literacy among college students in India. This study was conducted through an online questionnaire that involved scoring each student's knowledge level as per four domains: Knowledge about money & finance, Skills related to budgeting and managing cash flows, Knowledge about credit cards and loans, and Knowledge about insurance products and policies. 

The data gathered from this questionnaire has shown that across different income levels, the highest levels of financial literacy were seen by young adults who had attended colleges in top-tier institutions such as Delhi University, Mumbai University, Hyderabad University, etc., while the lowest levels were recorded by high school graduates enrolled in schools with lower average scores in the same categories. Similarly, there were no significant differences observed in terms of educational background or financial wellbeing between men and women irrespective of age group. Moreover, the younger generations tended to have higher scores than older ones throughout all the four domains, which suggests that financial literacy may be more closely associated with age rather than gender specifically. Overall, these findings indicate that financial literacy can indeed be learned through social interaction and education, but it requires careful attention to detail and patience over time to build up skills and develop resilience in sensitive times like these. To enhance financial literacy, we need to focus on building confidence and understanding around critical aspects of financial management and the importance of striving towards achieving financial security over the long term.  

Stress often plays a crucial role in limiting financial activities and making decisions about our lives. It can lead to depression, anxiety and poor health outcomes. Despite this, few researchers have systematically explored the relationship between financial literacy and negative emotions experienced during life, particularly those related to stress. One possible explanation could be that financial literacy requires us to identify potential risks early on, choose the most effective strategies and mitigate any unforeseen consequences before they become too much worse. By thinking critically and taking control of our financial situations, we can improve our mental health and reduce stress and worry. We can achieve this by adopting regular exercise routines, prioritizing savings and investments, being mindful of expenses and minimizing risk-taking behaviors. Additionally, we can start creating meaningful habits that incorporate financial literacy practices into daily living and integrate them into family life routines. Finally, we can seek out supportive communities and talk to professionals about our goals and concerns, share experiences and insights, and take steps to make better financial decisions. All of these efforts will go a long way in promoting financial literacy and improving overall mental health.

In summary, financial literacy involves awareness and skill set development around essential financial concepts and principles, including managing cash flow, credit card and loan usage, and insurance planning. Developing a robust understanding of these principles is vital to enabling effective financial management and improved financial outcomes. Furthermore, the dynamic interactions between emotional factors and financial literacy are key to understanding how our feelings impact our financial decisions and experience. By working cooperatively with others and paying close attention to our thoughts and actions, we can begin developing the necessary skills and tools to live a balanced, happy and healthy life.

## A. 定义
 - Financial Literacy (FL): The ability of individuals to manage their financial situation effectively, with a view to avoiding unnecessary stress on their lifestyle or relationships.

## B. 相关术语

 - Savings Account: An account where money is saved for future use. 

 - Credit Card: A payment method that allows consumers to obtain small amounts of funds from banks on a prepaid basis. 

 - Loan: A contractual arrangement in which one party gives some form of financial assistance to another person, usually in exchange for repayment of a specified amount of money within a certain period of time. 

  - Insurance Policy: A legal document that establishes the coverage plan and other obligations of an insurer against losses due to natural hazards or adverse events.

 ## C. 计算方法

Calculate the percentage difference of the mean score across domains when comparing groups based on Age Group, Gender, Educational Background and Student Status. Calculate the standard deviation of the scores. 

To compare FL scores for individual people, calculate z-score using the following formula:

Z = [(Score – Mean Score)/Standard Deviation]

The higher the Z value, the higher the likelihood of belonging to a particular category. For example, if someone’s Z score is greater than 1, they are highly likely to belong to Category 4, indicating that they lack FL. If their Z score is less than -1, they are very unlikely to belong to Category 1, indicating that they possess very good FL. If their Z score falls between -1 and 1, they fall somewhere inbetween Categories 1 and 4.
