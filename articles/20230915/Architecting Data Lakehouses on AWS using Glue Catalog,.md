Data lakehouses are a common approach to store and analyze big data in the cloud. It involves creating multiple layers of storage architecture consisting of relational database (RDBMS) for transactional processing, analytical databases like Amazon Redshift or Apache Hive for ad-hoc analytics, and data lakes such as Amazon S3 or Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 for long term archive. Each layer is designed to serve specific purposes and optimizes for different use cases. 

AWS provides several services that can be used to build data lakehouses on top of traditional RDBMS:

1. Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS): This service offers managed MySQL and PostgreSQL instances that can be used as part of the data lakehouse architecture.

2. Amazon Redshift: Amazon Redshift combines both OLAP (online analytical processing) capabilities with massive parallel processing capabilities to quickly execute complex queries against large datasets stored on Amazon S3. 

3. Amazon Athena: This service allows you to run SQL queries directly against data stored in Amazon S3 without needing to load the data into any RDBMS first. The results can then be analyzed using BI tools like Tableau or Power BI. 

In addition, we also have some options available through other AWS services:

4. AWS Glue Crawlers: These services allow you to automatically extract metadata from various sources and store it in an Amazon S3 bucket. You can then create tables in your RDBMS or data warehouse using these extracted metadata.

5. AWS Lake Formation: This service manages your entire data lakehouse by providing a single view of all your data assets across every layer. 

6. Amazon EMR Notebooks: These notebooks provide a familiar environment to explore and transform data within the AWS ecosystem. They come preloaded with popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit Learn etc., which make data exploration and analysis much easier.

7. AWS Lambda and Step Functions: These services help you orchestrate workflows involving various AWS services, including Athena, Glue, EMR, and others. For example, you could write a lambda function to trigger a Glue job whenever new data is added to Amazon S3 and update an existing Amazon Redshift table accordingly.

Together, these services provide a comprehensive solution for building scalable data lakehouses on AWS. However, understanding how they work under the hood requires a deep knowledge of underlying technologies such as IAM roles, security groups, network connectivity, and performance tuning. In this article, I will explain how you can architect a data lakehouse using AWS Glue catalog, Athena, and Redshift spectrum for improved performance, cost savings, and ease of management.
# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## 2.1 Data Lakes and Data Warehouses
A data lake is a central repository where raw data is collected from various sources such as social media platforms, mobile app logs, web clickstreams, IoT sensor data etc. Before being ingested into a data lake, the data must go through a series of processing steps such as normalization, enrichment, transformation, cleaning, and aggregation. Once processed, the cleansed and aggregated data is typically stored in a structured format like CSV, JSON, Parquet etc. This data is organized in folders based on business unit, type of data, date range, etc. These folders act as containers for individual data sets.

On the other hand, a data warehouse is a database optimized for enterprise-level reporting and analytical applications. It stores dimensional fact tables and dimension tables that are essential for aggregating and analyzing data from multiple sources. Instead of storing raw data, data warehousing systems normalize and integrate data before loading them into its tables. Dimension tables contain metadata about the customers, products, and sales orders while fact tables hold the actual financial transactions. With proper indexing, data warehousing systems enable fast and efficient querying of data. Additionally, data wareshoes often leverage star schema design techniques to optimize query execution times. Finally, data warehousing systems usually include robust security controls to protect sensitive customer information.

Overall, data lakes and data warehouses differ in their goal and scope. While data lakes aim at collecting, cleansing, integrating, and making available raw data for downstream analytics tasks, data warehouses aim at providing crystal-clear insights into company operations. Both data types require careful planning and investment to ensure accuracy and completeness of data.

## 2.2 Business Intelligence Tools
Business intelligence (BI) tools are widely used to extract meaningful insights from data warehouses and present them in easy-to-digest visual formats. Popular BI tools include Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, SAP BW/4HANA Analytics Cloud, QlikSense, Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition, and Google BigQuery.

Business users commonly interact with BI tools via a graphical user interface (GUI). They can easily navigate between reports, charts, and dashboards, filter and slice data, and drill down to specific details. The purpose of BI tools is not only to provide valuable insights but also to simplify decision-making processes by allowing businesses to access relevant data at glance.

## 2.3 AWS Glue
AWS Glue is a serverless ETL (extract-transform-load) service offered by AWS. It simplifies the process of moving data between different data sources, running scripts, and categorizing data.

When you use AWS Glue, you don't need to worry about setting up infrastructure or managing servers. All you need is a simple programming language like Python or Scala and a way to define your transformations. By leveraging AWS Glue's built-in libraries, you can perform complex data manipulations such as joining data sets, filtering, sorting, grouping, and more.

Once transformed, the output can be loaded back into Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, or Amazon Elasticsearch Service for further analysis. AWS Glue makes it easy to integrate data from disparate sources, ensuring consistent formatting and consistency throughout the organization.

## 2.4 AWS Glue Crawler
AWS Glue crawlers crawl various data sources and extract metadata. Metadata includes information like data types, schemas, partitions, and location in Amazon S3. Once crawled, the metadata can be registered as tables in Amazon Athena, Amazon Redshift, or Amazon ES.

Crawlers continuously monitor the source data for changes, so they can keep your data lake up-to-date with recent updates. They also support incremental crawls, meaning only the latest data needs to be crawled instead of recrawling everything from scratch every time.

## 2.5 AWS Athena
Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that enables you to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. It uses the same engine that powers Amazon Redshift and supports millions of rows per second, enabling fast ad-hoc queries over petabytes of data.

Athena uses a declarative language called ANSI SQL, which has strict syntax requirements and usage patterns. This means that you won't have to learn a new query language unless you want to. Simply point Athena to your data in Amazon S3 and start writing queries right away.

You can connect to Athena either through the AWS Management Console, the command line tool, or the JDBC driver. Alternatively, you can integrate Athena with various third-party BI tools like Tableau or Power BI to visualize your data and generate interactive dashboards.

## 2.6 AWS Redshift
Amazon Redshift is a fully-managed data warehouse service that lets you scale compute capacity instantly and independently. It is optimized for running complex analytic queries and real-time analytics. Unlike traditional data warehouses, Redshift allows you to take advantage of fast low-latency intra-node communication to perform high-speed joins, groupings, summarization, and computations.

Redshift uses columnar storage and data compression to achieve significant reductions in storage space. It also uses automatic partitioning and clustering to organize data, resulting in faster queries and reduced costs compared to row-based storage methods.

## 2.7 AWS Redshift Spectrum
Amazon Redshift Spectrum is a feature that allows you to run analytical queries directly against your data stored in Amazon S3 without having to load the data into Redshift first. To do this, you simply create external tables that reference files in Amazon S3. Spectrum works best when you need to analyze very large datasets that would otherwise exceed Redshift's limits.

The benefit of Redshift Spectrum lies in speed and cost efficiency. You no longer need to provision cluster resources to perform the heavy computations required to handle complex queries, reducing total costs and eliminating unnecessary scaling bottlenecks. With Redshift Spectrum, you can still use Redshift to manage the permissions and auditability of your data, while enjoying the benefits of cloud-native distributed computing.

## 2.8 Summary
In summary, here is what we learned during our research into building a data lakehouse on AWS:

1. We can choose among different AWS services to build a data lakehouse depending on the nature of the data and the level of complexity needed. For example, if we have relatively static data or just need basic aggregations and filtering functions, we may use Amazon Athena alongside Amazon RDS or Amazon Redshift. If we have highly dynamic data that requires near real-time processing, we may consider using Amazon Kinesis Streams or Apache Kafka coupled with Amazon EMR or Amazon Glue.

2. Building a data lakehouse using AWS Glue crawlers, Amazon Athena, and Amazon Redshift Spectrum gives us a flexible, scalable, and cost-effective architecture that can accommodate growing volumes of data. Amazon Glue automates the process of extracting metadata from various sources and registering them as tables in Amazon Athena or Amazon Redshift. Athena delivers fast, ad-hoc queries with minimal latency, and Redshift Spectrum brings analytics directly to S3 without loading data into a dedicated instance. Combining these three services helps us maintain control over our data, automate ETL jobs, and maximize utilization of cloud resources.
