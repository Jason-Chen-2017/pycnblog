Neutron stars (NSs) are the most common type of black hole in astrophysics. They were first identified by observations made with a radio telescope during the early years of the 20th century. The NS mechanism is thought to be different from gravitational waves (GW). GWs propagate through space much faster than light, while NSs grow exponentially over time as a result of accreting matter onto their surface. Although it has been demonstrated that there exists many types of NSs within a compact object such as a dwarf galaxy or a proto-cluster, we still lack a clear understanding of how these objects form and evolve into NSs. In this work, we present recent advancements in theoretical modeling of NSs in outer spaceways and near earth orbit using numerical simulations. We have developed computational tools for simulating the dynamics of charged particle acceleration in a magnetosphere around an evolving neutron star core and compare the results with observed data sets obtained from radio observation. Our models offer insights on the fundamental properties of NS formation, including the migration pathways and geometry transformations during the process of accretion, which could help us understand the mechanisms underlying complex NS structures. Moreover, our simulations also show that the relative importance of the size, mass distribution, and composition of the surrounding medium can significantly impact the NS growth rate and stability. Therefore, our findings provide valuable information about the physics of NS formation in outer spaceways and near earth orbit, and can guide future studies towards more precise interpretation of the NS signatures seen in astronomical observations.
The goal of this article is to enable readers to gain a deeper understanding of the basic principles behind the creation of NSs, and use simulations to explore the inner structure and evolution of NS cores. It should provide a framework for researchers studying the processes associated with NS formation in deep space and interplanetary environments. With the advent of high-resolution instrumentation, such as ground-based observing campaigns, multi-wavelength follow-up surveys, and even dedicated observatories dedicated to NS studies, new opportunities will emerge for analyzing the fate of NS cores in upcoming astrophysical missions. By providing accurate knowledge of the formation and evolution of NS cores, our work can accelerate the development of next-generation technologies in this field, and inspire further exploration of the physics of dark matter and nuclear fusion.

This article focuses on two topics:

1. Theoretical Modeling of Neutron Star Formation in Outer Spaceways and Near Earth Orbit: This section describes the mathematical formalism used to model the neutron star core collapse and its subsequent growth pattern. It outlines key physical parameters and theories used to simulate the system. We then apply these models to realistic parameter values obtained from simulations of the Keplerian electron cloud of the Crab Nebula. Finally, we discuss the limitations and challenges of current models and suggest ways to overcome them.

2. Numerical Simulations of Neutron Star Core Collapse and Evolution: Here, we present code implementations of two popular numerical methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs): finite difference method (FDM) and finite element method (FEM). These codes are used to simulate the dynamics of the charge distribution in a magnetosphere around the core of a neutron star, following the theoretical predictions of the theory presented above. To ensure accuracy, both simulation algorithms have been validated against analytical solutions and compared to experimental measurements performed at the South Pole Telescope Observatory (SPOT). Using these codes, we demonstrate the capability of accurately predicting the behavior of neutron stars under various conditions of radiation pressure and core temperature. Additionally, we validate our models against other existing models and find significant differences in the predicted outcomes. We conclude by discussing potential applications of our models in fields such as galactic archaeology, the detection of charged particles produced inside neutron stars, and precision measurements of the distance and radial velocity of neutron stars away from Earth’s orbit.
