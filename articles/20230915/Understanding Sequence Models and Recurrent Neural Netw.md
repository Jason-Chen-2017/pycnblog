# 1.简介
  

Sequence models are the building blocks of natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, speech recognition, sentiment analysis etc., and they have received extensive attention in recent years due to their ability to handle sequential data efficiently and effectively. 

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) units have been particularly popular for sequence modeling because of their ability to capture contextual relationships between words or tokens in a sentence while keeping track of dependencies over time. In this article, we will introduce these two powerful tools and discuss how they can be used to build effective sequence models. We also look at some more advanced methods that have emerged recently, such as Transformers and Convolutional LSTM Networks, which enable us to model complex sequences with high accuracy without sacrificing speed or capacity.

This is an intermediate-level deep learning article suitable for those who already know basic neural network concepts, understand the basics of deep learning algorithms like backpropagation, regularization, and optimization, and have experience working with text and sequence data.

# 2.Background Introduction
In order to understand RNNs and LSTMs, let's start by understanding what is meant by "sequence". A sequence is simply a collection of ordered items, typically related but not necessarily connected, and usually represented using a specific notation such as strings, lists, arrays, tensors, or matrices. For instance, consider the following examples:

1. "hello world" - This string is a sequence of characters where each character represents a word/token. Each letter corresponds to its position within the sequence. 

2. [2, 4, 7, 9] - This list contains four integers representing numbers from low to high. These values form a sequence since they represent something meaningful regardless of their positions relative to each other.

3. [[0.1, 0.2], [0.3, 0.4]] - This matrix consists of rows and columns containing floating point numbers. The elements along each dimension represent the values associated with each step in the sequence.

4. [[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]] - This tensor has three dimensions corresponding to steps, rows, and columns. It contains numerical values representing events that occur across multiple dimensions.

When it comes to modeling sequences, there are several types of approaches commonly used. Some examples include:

1. Markov chains - These models assume that future states only depend on the present state, i.e., the current state cannot affect the future state directly. One example of a simple Markov chain model would be predicting the next character in a sentence based on the previous few characters.

2. Hidden markov models (HMMs) - These models make use of probabilistic inference techniques to determine the probability distribution of the hidden variables given observations. They are widely used for speech recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition among others.

3. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) - These models combine information from past inputs into the current output, hence the name recurrent. Examples of applications of RNNs include image captioning, language modeling, sentiment analysis, and many others.

4. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks - These networks consist of a set of gating mechanisms that control the flow of information through the network. They were proposed in 1997 to solve problems that arose during training of traditional RNNs, leading to significant improvements in performance.

Now that you have a general idea about the various forms of sequencing, we can move onto discussing how RNNs work.

# 3.Core Concepts and Terminology
Before we dive deeper into RNNs and LSTMs, it's important to first cover some core concepts and terminology. You should become familiar with the terms below before moving forward.

## Input Sequences
The input sequence(s) is the starting point of any sequence modeling task. It represents the initial piece of information passed into the system being modeled. Common examples of input sequences include:

- Text - The raw input could be a sentence, paragraph, or document. However, most sequence models require preprocessed representations of the input, such as numeric vectors or binary representation of words.

- Images - Input images could be treated as sequences of pixel intensities, where each vector represents one frame in the video clip. Other methods involve compressing the image down into lower dimensional embeddings using convolutional neural networks (CNN).

- Audio signals - Similarly to audio clips, audio signals could be treated as sequences of sound samples or waveforms. Preprocessing steps could involve filtering out noise and extracting features such as MFCCs (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients), FFTs (Fast Fourier Transforms), or Short-time Fourier transforms (STFTs).

- Time series data - Input time series could be univariate or multivariate, consisting of discrete or continuous measurements taken at different points in time. Preprocessing involves normalization, detrending, interpolation, and feature extraction.

## Output Sequences
Output sequences are the final result obtained after running the input sequences through the sequence model. Most sequence models generate probabilities for the likelihood of each possible outcome or action, which can then be fed back into the system to influence subsequent actions. Common examples of output sequences include:

- Sentiment classification - The output could be a class label indicating whether the input was positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Alternatively, the output could be a score between 0 and 1 indicating the degree of positivity or negativity in the input.

- Speech recognition - The output could be a sequence of phonemes representing the pronunciation of the input speech.

- Machine translation - The output could be a sequence of words or phrases in the target language generated by translating the source language input.

- Image segmentation - The output could be a mask identifying objects or regions in the input image.

- Video prediction - The output could be a sequence of frames showing what the scene would look like in the future, based on the past movements or actions.

It's essential to note that the type of output produced by a particular sequence model depends on the problem being solved and the desired level of granularity required. Thus, sequence models are highly dependent on the application domain and require careful design to achieve optimal results.
