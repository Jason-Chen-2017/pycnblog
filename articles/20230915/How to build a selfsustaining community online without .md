# 1.简介
  

随着社交网络、新闻媒体等信息的快速流通，越来越多的人通过互联网进行各种各样的活动，如购物、旅游、发布信息、交流想法等。这些活动都离不开社交网络平台，包括YouTube、Facebook、Twitter等。虽然平台提供了丰富的功能，但对于那些追求自我支援的个人来说，广告的存在会给人们带来负面影响。广告的存在让人们不得不不停下脚步，频繁地进行互动和思考，因此在这种情况下，如何建立一个独立而健康的社区并保持其活力是十分重要的。

对于YouTube这样的视频平台，其最大的问题就是没有足够的广告收入来维持平台的正常运营。本文将讨论如何构建一个能够持续盈利的社区（community）网站，其基础设施由自由的开源代码库提供，且无需依赖于任何类型的广告。

# 2. Basic concepts and terminology 
# 2.1 Community building: What is it and why is it important?
Community Building (CB) refers to the process of creating or developing a group of people with similar interests that shares common goals and passions. It involves finding ways to foster long-term relationships between members through communication, cooperation, and support. 

The importance of CB goes beyond the traditional definition of “creating a strong social network” by recognizing its role in driving engagement, participation, and growth for an organization or individual. The emergence of new digital mediums such as YouTube and Facebook have led to a shift in how we perceive communities, which are increasingly defined by their shared experiences rather than explicit membership criteria. By understanding and navigating these complexities, businesses can create successful virtual teams that can generate profits while also providing meaningful customer interactions.

# 2.2 Advertising: what's wrong with them?
Advertising has become one of the most significant challenges facing online platforms today. In this context, advertising consists of all forms of marketing media including display ads, video ads, sponsored content, live streaming advertisements etc., designed to persuade users into making purchases, clicking on ads, sharing videos, subscribing to websites or apps.

Although advertisers spend billions of dollars each year to produce ads, they are rarely profitable due to various factors like low clickthrough rates, low quality ads, overly restrictive policies, and poor branding efforts. Overall, marketers use advertising to manipulate viewpoints, sell products, influence public opinion, and deceive consumers, among other illicit activities.

To increase the appeal of YouTube, Google launched Creative Services, a program to help brands develop high-quality creative assets that attract viewers' attention, improve engagement, and encourage further engagement within the platform. However, it remains unclear whether these programs will be effective enough to offset the negative effects of advertising on YouTube’s business model.

In recent years, there has been growing concern about the negative impact of technology on society, particularly in terms of advertising revenue, privacy concerns, and data collection. Many organizations, notably NGOs and activists, have begun adopting alternative approaches to fundraising and raising funds for causes. Some of these alternatives include donations, crowdfunding platforms, and grassroots initiatives. Despite these advancements, the value of YouTube as a leading provider of entertainment content and culture still lies largely in its ability to provide a safe haven for millions of daily viewers.

Ultimately, the challenge for commercial platforms like YouTube is not just to avoid negative consequences but to maintain a sense of pride in offering valuable content, independent from the encroaching influence of advertising.
