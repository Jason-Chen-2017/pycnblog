Archiving is one of the most important processes in any IT organization and it helps to reduce data redundancy, optimize backup usage, improve performance and maintainability. It also plays a crucial role in protecting business from financial loss caused by natural disasters or other unforeseen issues that can cause data loss. 

MySQL is an open source database management system and its backups are critical as they provide valuable information about databases such as table schemas, data size, indexes used etc. It's essential to archive these files so that they remain accessible even after the original server is no longer available. In addition, it's also recommended to keep multiple copies of backups at different geographical locations to ensure high availability and reliability. 

In this article, we will discuss how to efficiently archive MySQL backup files for long term storage using various methods such as cloud services, offline storage options like tape drives, and online file synchronization tools. We will go through all the steps involved in achieving optimal results including directory structure creation, moving files between servers, backup rotation strategy, and finally syncing with remote backup repository. Let's get started!

Before discussing further details on archiving MySQL backup files, let's first understand some key terms related to MySQL backup operations: 

1. **Backup**: A complete copy of all the required data stored somewhere else.

2. **Restore**: The process of retrieving back the backuped data. This involves copying the backuped data into the target machine where the restored data should be present.

3. **Backup media**: Any medium (disk, flash disk, network drive) used to store the backup data. Examples include magnetic tapes, optical disks, CD/DVD/Blu-Ray burners, hard disks, USB drives, etc.

4. **Backup schedule**: Schedule defining when the backup operation must be performed to avoid data loss. Daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly etc.

5. **Backup retention period**: Time duration during which backup must be retained before being deleted either manually or automatically based on certain criteria such as space limit or number of backups allowed per day/month.

6. **Compression algorithm**: Algorithm used to compress the backup data to save storage space and improve restore time.

Now that you have understood basic concepts related to MySQL backup operations, let us now dive deep into achieving efficient MySQL backup storage. 

## 3. Efficient MySQL Backup Storage Options
There are several ways to archive MySQL backup files for long-term storage:

1. Cloud Services: Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Microsoft Azure Blob storage etc. These services offer easy access to object storage, automatic scaling, high availability, and low cost. They allow developers to offload their backups onto these platforms for cheap and reliable backup storage. However, storing large amounts of data in cloud storage can still become expensive if not done carefully and optimized.

2. Offline Tape Drives: In situations where immediate retrieval of backup is not critical, backing up directly to tape drives can help to minimize overall infrastructure costs. Tape libraries can hold thousands of tapes and handle large volumes of data quickly. Another advantage of using offline storage is reduced latency compared to accessing cloud services or local file systems. However, managing tape library inventory, scheduling jobs, formatting drives, etc., becomes challenging.

3. Online File Synchronization Tools: Rsync, Cronicle, Waldur Sync, etc. These tools provide real-time file synchronization capabilities across multiple servers and clients over a wide area network (WAN). They can synchronize specific directories, backup files, or entire file systems. The main benefit of these solutions is simplicity and ease of use. However, they may require additional hardware resources, configuration, and maintenance.

In general, cloud services, offline tape drives, and online file synchronization tools provide complementary approaches to achieve efficient backup storage. Each method has its own strengths and advantages depending on the requirements and constraints of the organization. Choosing the best option depends on factors such as budget, staff skillsets, data size, frequency of backup, and accessibility needs. 

Based on our research, here are some key recommendations for optimizing MySQL backup storage:

1. Use appropriate compression algorithms: Choose the right compression algorithm based on your desired level of efficiency and compressed file sizes. Gzip and Bzip2 are commonly used algorithms for Linux systems but LZMA offers better compression ratios than gzip. Other popular compression algorithms include Zstandard, Snappy, Xz, and LZO.

2. Implement regular backup rotations: Regular backup rotation reduces risk of data loss due to failures and accidental deletions. Periodically creating new backups ensures that each backup contains consistent set of data. Backups need to be created frequently enough to meet application recovery points objective (RPO), i.e., maximum acceptable point in time in case of failure or disaster.

3. Maintain multiple copies of backups: Keep multiple copies of backups at different geographical locations for higher availability and reliability. Create redundant backups to prevent data loss in case of regional outages or catastrophic events.

4. Test restoration procedures: Always test restoration procedures thoroughly before performing actual restore operations. Verify that the backup data can be safely restored without causing irreversible damage to the original database or system. Restoring backups requires careful planning, testing, and validation to ensure successful completion within given SLAs.

5. Use secure communication protocols: Ensure that backup data is encrypted while transferring and storing it remotely. Encryption provides added layer of security and protection against data breaches. SSL certificates can be purchased from trusted certificate authorities or generated using OpenSSL software.
