Deep neural networks have shown great success for image classification tasks with increasing computational power, leading to breakthroughs like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), ResNet, DenseNet, etc., while also imposing several challenges on the generalization of CNNs trained using large datasets such as ImageNet. 

One challenge is that different mini-batch inputs may contain variations within certain dimensions or ranges, which can lead to artificial fluctuations during training. To address this issue, the popular batch normalization technique has been widely used in modern deep learning architectures. However, its application usually relies only on a single mini-batch and therefore may underperform when facing out-of-distribution samples outside the distribution range observed in the training set. This paper proposes a novel virtual batch normalization method, named VBN, which leverages multiple mini-batches from the same dataset to construct more robust statistics of the input data distribution, thereby improving generalization performance. The proposed approach enables better feature representation, reduces model overfitting, and improves accuracy in real world scenarios where models are exposed to diverse inputs.

In addition, we propose a simple yet effective way to implement VBN with minimal modifications of existing codebase by simply adding an additional hyperparameter to control how many previous batches should be considered as part of the virtual batch normalization process. Moreover, our experiments show that VBN consistently outperforms standard batch normalization on various benchmarks including CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, and Kinetics-400, achieving improved accuracy across a wide range of factors, such as network architecture design, regularization techniques, hyperparameters, and data augmentation strategies.

## 2.1. 基本概念及术语定义
### Batch normalization(BN):
Batch normalization (BN) is a well-known technique for reducing internal covariate shift and accelerating the convergence of stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithms [1]. It works by normalizing each mini-batch of data before it is fed into any subsequent layer of the neural network. BN helps prevent vanishing gradients and makes sure that all layers learn at a similar rate regardless of their input scale. Mathematically, BN involves computing the mean and variance of the mini-batch inputs, subtracting the means from the inputs, and then scaling them by the inverse square root of the variances, as follows:


where μ and σ are the population mean and variance of the mini-batch inputs, respectively, ε is a small constant added to avoid division by zero errors, and γ and β are the learned parameters after training. In practice, these values are often estimated online during training using running averages.

### Gradient clipping:
Gradient clipping is a commonly used technique in deep neural networks to prevent exploding gradients that occur due to high error signals during backpropagation [2]. Specifically, the value of a weight parameter is updated based on the gradient calculated during backpropagation, but if this gradient is too large, it could cause the weights to explode, resulting in numerical instability or even loss of precision. Therefore, one common strategy is to clip the absolute value of the gradients so that they do not exceed some threshold value.

### Out-of-distribution sample detection:
Out-of-distribution (OoD) samples refer to those that fall outside the distribution range observed during training. One typical scenario occurs when a deep neural network is deployed in a real-world setting where new types of images or videos need to be classified. In such cases, OoD samples pose significant challenges because they can potentially degrade the performance of the classifier significantly. Various methods have been proposed to detect OoD samples, ranging from simple visual inspection of the sample to more sophisticated statistical analysis of the features extracted by the network.

### Variance stabilization:
Variance stabilization refers to techniques that use more stable estimates of the variances instead of raw variance estimates computed directly on mini-batch inputs. These include moment estimation approaches such as running variance and exponential moving average, and other non-parametric approaches such as kernel density estimators.

## 2.2. VBN相关术语定义
VBN:
Virtual Batch Normalization (VBN) is a novel approach to improve generalization performance of convolutional neural networks by leveraging multiple mini-batches from the same dataset. The key idea behind VBN is to exploit information from multiple mini-batches to construct more robust statistics of the input data distribution. Instead of relying solely on a single mini-batch, VBN uses multiple previous mini-batches sampled uniformly at random from the same dataset as "virtual" mini-batches. These virtual mini-batches share the same statistics as would be obtained if they were merged together. By incorporating multiple previous mini-batches, VBN provides a more comprehensive view of the data distribution and can achieve higher accuracy than standard BN on certain benchmark datasets, while being computationally efficient.

### Hyperparameters:
The two primary hyperparameters involved in VBN are τ and Np. τ determines the degree of smoothing applied to the mini-batch distributions, while Np controls the number of previous mini-batches to consider in constructing the virtual mini-batches. Intuitively, larger values of τ lead to smoother virtual mini-batches, while smaller values result in finer details in the data distribution. Larger values of Np increase the diversity of the virtual mini-batches and reduce the potential impact of noise present in individual mini-batches.

The choice of appropriate values of τ and Np will depend on the specific problem domain and data distribution. For example, τ=10−3 might work well for natural image classification problems involving very small mini-batches, whereas Np=10 typically performs best for small datasets like ImageNet. Additionally, different values of τ and Np can be tried to see what combination results in the optimal tradeoff between smoothness and diversity of the virtual mini-batches.

### Statistics accumulation:
During training, VBN maintains four statistical measures related to the mini-batch distributions: E[x], E[y^2] (the second moment of the labels y), E[μk] (the mean vector of k-th previous mini-batches x_i), and E[(μk - μ)^2 + σ^2] (a term that captures the spread of k-th mini-batches around their mean). The first three statistics are updated iteratively using a running mean scheme and allow VBN to estimate the statistics of the current mini-batch relative to the entire accumulated history of mini-batches seen so far. Overall, the goal of VBN is to minimize the difference between the predicted logit probabilities P(y|x) of the final output layer and the true conditional probability P(y|x) by effectively recalibrating the predicted probabilities on the basis of both the labeled examples and the unlabeled examples in the same minibatch.

### Conclusion:
To summarize, VBN combines ideas from traditional batch normalization and variance stabilization techniques to construct more robust statistics of the input data distribution through multi-view inference. VBN applies statistical estimates from multiple previous mini-batches to construct a virtual mini-batch that shares the same statistics as would be obtained if all mini-batches were combined together. The degree of smoothing and diversity of the virtual mini-batches can be controlled through two hyperparameters, τ and Np, allowing VBN to adapt to different situations and settings. Empirical results suggest that VBN consistently outperforms standard BN on various benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the fundamental issues associated with BN's limited ability to handle out-of-distribution samples.
