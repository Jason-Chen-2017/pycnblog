# 1.简介
  

Mathematical programming (MP) is a class of optimization methods that find the best solution among many possible solutions subjected to constraints or objectives that can be expressed as mathematical expressions. The word "mathematical" refers to the fact that MP algorithms solve problems mathematically by using linear algebra, calculus, and other mathematical concepts like probabilities, distributions, and statistical theory. In this article we will cover basic concepts, terms, and operations in MP and show how these concepts are used to formulate and solve various types of problems. We also present practical examples in Python and Matlab to demonstrate how to apply these concepts effectively. Finally, we provide some suggestions for future directions in this field.


In addition to traditional linear and nonlinear optimization problems, MP has been applied to problems with more complex structures such as constrained convex programming (CCP), semidefinite programming (SDP), mixed integer programming (MIP), stochastic programming, and bioinformatics applications. We hope that this article will serve as an introduction to the vast world of MP research and practice.

# 2.Basic Concepts and Terms
The following sections provide definitions and terminology necessary for understanding the fundamental concepts and techniques behind MP. These definitions and terms will help us understand why and how MP works, what kind of problems it can solve, and how to approach solving them. 

## Problem Definition and Formulation
A mathematical program consists of two parts: a decision variable x and an objective function f(x). The decision variables represent the unknown quantities that need to be optimized; they may take on different values during the course of the optimization process. The objective function measures the value of the decision variables based on certain criteria or objectives, which must be minimized or maximized depending on whether we want to maximize or minimize the outcome. Problems can have zero or more constraints that limit the range of feasible solutions.

An MP problem can be defined either informally by specifying its goal, objective function, decision variables, and constraints, or formally through specific equations or functions that describe each component of the problem. Some popular formulations include:

1. Maximization/Minimization of an Objective Function: Given a set of decision variables x, the most common type of problem involves finding the optimal value of an objective function f(x) subject to given constraints. This can be written as:

   Minimize/Maximize c^T * x

    Where c is a vector representing the coefficients of the objective function, x represents the decision variables, and ^T denotes transpose operation. Here's an example:
    
    **Example:**
    
    A company wants to invest $10,000 into marketing campaigns for their product. They would like to choose between four marketing strategies: direct mail, online advertising, social media ads, and paid search. To evaluate the effectiveness of each strategy, the company collects data on the number of clicks, impressions, conversions, revenue, cost per click (CPC), and cost per acquisition (CPA). Based on this information, the company needs to select the three most effective strategies and allocate $5,000 towards them. Which one should the company choose? How much should they spend on each strategy?
    
    Maximizing CPA = min_x -CPA * x + y
        
        Subject to:

        1 <= x_i <= 1, i=1...n-1
            
        0 <= x_n <= 5000
           
        where n is the number of strategies chosen (in this case, n=3)
        
    Solving this problem requires transforming it from a minimization problem to a maximization problem and solving it using linear programming solvers like Simplex or Interior-Point Methods. Here's the resulting equation:
    
    Maximize c^T * x = -(0.7*impression + 0.2*click + 0.1*conversion)*x+y
    
          s.t.:
            
            x >= 0
            
            sum(x)=5000
            
    Simplifying further, we get:
    
    Maximize z = (-0.7*impression - 0.2*click - conversion)*x+y
        
        Subject to:
            
            x>=0
            
        where 
        
           z = -0.7*impression - 0.2*click - conversion  
               
           y = [direct mail, online advertising, social media ads]  
            
As you can see, converting an optimization problem from minimization to maximization typically involves negating the objective function term and adjusting sign for the constraints.

Note that there are several variations of the above formulations that are often encountered when working with MP problems. For example, if there are no non-negative constraints, then the last constraint becomes redundant since any negative element of x implies that at least one of the elements of y must be positive. Also, if all variables are binary instead of continuous, then the constraints become simpler because only inequality operators (<, >, =) are allowed instead of equality (=). Moreover, the notation varies slightly depending on the solver being used.

## Optimization Models and Algorithms
Optimization models are a category of mathematical tools used to analyze, design, and optimize various systems, processes, and products. There are numerous optimization models, but they can broadly be divided into two main categories: linear programming and nonlinear programming. 

Linear programming models involve optimizing over real-valued decision variables that satisfy linear relationships. Constraints are linear inequalities, equalities, and logical conditions involving multiple variables. Linear programming algorithms use simplex method, interior point methods, and active set methods to find the optimum solution. Examples of linear programming problems include transportation planning, inventory management, resource allocation, etc.

Nonlinear programming models involve optimizing over real-valued decision variables that cannot always be represented exactly as a linear combination of linear decision variables. Examples of nonlinear programming problems include geophysical inversion, economic optimization, risk analysis, simulation optimization, etc. Nonlinear programming algorithms use gradient descent, quasi-Newton methods, trust region methods, and augmented Lagrangian methods to find the optimum solution.
