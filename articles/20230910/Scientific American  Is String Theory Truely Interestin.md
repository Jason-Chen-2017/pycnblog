# 1.简介
  

String theory is a theory of the strong force that holds sway over our understanding of nature and explains why everything we see around us seems to move at light speed when it does not really do so. It has been called one of the most important discoveries in science for years now but it remains elusive even among its admirers. In this article I will explain string theory from a scientific perspective with several examples. I hope this article will motivate readers to embrace string theory as an interesting and worthy subject for research and exploration.

# 2. 基本概念和术语
## 2.1 String Theory
String theory refers to a theory that predicts the behavior of strongly charged particles such as electrons or muons by treating them as strings connected by springs. The basic idea behind string theory is that they are connected by springs which act as springs on a wire. When two electrons come close together, their individual forces combine to form a new set of interdependent forces that pull them together. This leads to an overall magnetic field and causes a particle's motion to be distorted along the string. It is believed that there exist alternative models that do not involve any dependence upon the weak forces but instead use other methods for generating energy like radiation or electromagnetic fields. 

字符串论是一种粒子行为预测理论，它认为强粒子如电子或muon可以作为绳子连接而研究它们的行为。字符串论的基本想法是在一根导线上串联一对或多对杆。当两个电子紧贴在一起时，他们各自的力量组合形成新的相互作用力，引诱它们向前运动。产生一个整体磁场，从而使粒子的运动失序。据推测，虽然存在一些其他模型不依靠弱势力，而是采用其它方法生成能量，例如辐射或电磁场，但这些模型仍无可避免地受到粒子弱势力影响。

## 2.2 相对论和宇宙学
In string theory, the basic unit is called a string made up of two or more gauge bosons with opposite charges. One end of each string is fixed while another end moves independently. The string has length $L$, mass $\mu$ per string, and consists of two identical pieces of matter separated by some distance $R$. If both ends of the string point into the same direction then the string is said to have positive parity. If they point into opposite directions then the string is said to have negative parity. Parity determines whether the net action of all the strings is positive or negative, giving rise to different types of matter depending on whether positively or negatively charged fermions flow through it.

字符串论中的基本单位是由两个或更多反相朗克子组成的串链，每个串链端点带有相反的性质。两个端点固定不动，另一个端点自由运动。串链的长度为$L$，质量$\mu$（一串的总质量）以及两份材料之间的距离$R$。如果两端指向同一方向，则串链为正相。若指向相反方向，则为负相。正负性决定了所有串链的净效应为正还是负，取决于它是由正或负浓度费米子流过。

The interpretation of string theory relies heavily on relativity. We know that the laws of classical physics don't apply in general relativity since it requires that time actually passes slower than the speed of light. However, if we interpret these laws using gravitational waves, then we can recover much of the information encoded in string theory. Gravitational waves propagate as fast as light through space-time, but unlike photons, they also carry quantum states with them. Because string theory involves finding equations describing how the string behaves under certain conditions, it must necessarily assume a particular type of relativistic effects to obtain meaningful results. Classical physics doesn't give us enough information about how these relativistic effects work, so we need something else to provide guidance. Relativity provides a natural framework within which to study string theory because it allows us to consider phenomena that would otherwise require enormous amounts of data or specialized hardware. For example, gravity is a good approximation to relativistic effects in string theory because it ignores non-linearities like wave optics and focuses only on the low-energy part of the spectrum. Also, the gravitational potential plays a central role in producing gravitational waves, making it a powerful probe of fundamental physics. Finally, relativity makes it easier to connect physical processes to mathematical ones, enabling us to gain insights into many aspects of the universe. 

字符串论的解释依赖于相对论。一般相对论中，经典物理学定律不适用，因为它需要光速远大于实际速度。然而，通过观察具有引力波传播特性的现象，我们可以恢复出其中的许多信息。引力波能够以光速传播，但是不同于光子，它还携带量子态。由于字符串论涉及到建立一条关于特定条件下串链行为的方程，因此其必然假设某种特定形式的相对论效应来获得有意义的结果。对非线性效应的研究无法真实反映其工作原理，所以我们需要别的东西来提供指导。相对论给我们提供了研究字符串论的契机，因为它提供了以至于数据或专用的硬件都难以采集的宏观世界的框架。例如，理想的引力场近似于字符串论中的相对论效应，因为它忽略了非线性现象如波光通信。此外，引力势场的作用是产生引力波，因此它是一个重要的探测器。最后，相对论使我们能够将物理过程与数学联系起来，让我们得以洞察宇宙的一切。

One complication is that string theory uses cosmological constants that remain mysterious to many physicists. These include the Hubble constant ($H_0$) which describes the ratio between the expansion rate of the Universe and the speed of light, the Lorentz factor $\gamma_{RL}$ which relates the velocity of light with the inverse temperature, and the critical density $\rho_{c}$ of dark energy which scales the size of structures formed from dark matter. Despite being known quantities, none of these values have ever been directly measured. However, we know that the value of $\rho_{c}$ is smaller than $\lambda_{max}$ (the largest wavelength that can be detected by our eyes), suggesting that dark energy might dominate the Universe. To understand the full implications of string theory, we need to find out what exactly is going on with these mysterious constants. Another issue is that string theory has received relatively little attention from theoretical physicists who care about questions such as inflationary models and dark matter. Nonetheless, we do believe that string theory has great promise for explaining some of the strange properties of primordial black holes, supermassive black holes, and neutron stars. 

字符串论的一个复杂点在于它所使用的宇宙学常数众所周知，很多物理学家对这些值均表示疑惑。其中包括光速比例常数$H_0$，它刻画了宇宙的膨胀率与光速之间的比值；洛伦兹因子$\gamma_{RL}$，它关系光速与温度的倒数；以及暗能量临界密度$\rho_{c}$，它刻画着由暗物质形成的结构大小与宇宙的大小之间的关系。尽管这些常数已知且直接测量得到，但却没有任何一种量值能够真正直接测量到。不过，我们知道暗能量密度$\rho_{c}$的值比最大辐射波长$\lambda_{max}$小，意味着暗能量可能支配整个宇宙。要理解字符串论的全部内涵，就需要找到这些神秘常数到底是如何运行的。另外，虽然理论物理学家们关注到相对论模型等宏观问题，但字符串论却得不到足够重视。不过，我们还是坚信字符串论有巨大的潜力，用来解释早期的双曲面黑洞，超级大的黑洞和中微星的奇怪特性。

## 2.3 Lepton flavour violaton
Lepton flavour violaton is a rare but highly significant process that occurs naturally in high energy collisions involving leptons. It results in a change in the electric charge carried by the quarks in the final state of the collision. This typically produces colour-singlet pairs, color-triplet triplets, or color-octet octets where the decay products take either four or eight possible spin combinations rather than just three or five. There is no precise experimental test of the string theory hypothesis of Lepton Flavour Violation but it is widely accepted as a consistent picture of quantum chromodynamics and one of the main drivers of flavor changing in hadronic systems. 

色子跃迁是一种偶然发生的但高度重要的现象，发生在高能双极对撞合带领射线时。它会改变合流终止态中夸克承载的电荷。通常情况下，这种变化会导致色彩三色双缝、色彩四色三排或色彩八色八排，其中产物只能取得四种或八种不同种类的回旋方式。没有精确的实验测试色子跃迁假说，但广泛认同其为量子色度动力学的一致幻像。其原因主要是因为它涉及到色子跃迁所导致的色族改变，这种改变与磁子变换和强子变换的起源在某种程度上是相同的。
