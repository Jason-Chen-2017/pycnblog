Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) has been a popular technology recently due to its high realism and immersive experience. However, this immersive environment brings many challenges to human cognitive abilities. Cognitive deficits can result from poor understanding of the perceived physical world or environments. The goal of IVR is to provide users with a simulated space that provides an enhanced mental performance by providing naturalistic views and illusion of depth and perspective. In order to enhance the user’s cognitive ability, it is essential to develop new visual metaphors to understand complex objects such as humans and animals in immersive virtual reality. This paper presents an ethnographic study on how people interact with animals, plants, and other objects within their immersive virtual reality spaces. It also explores the importance of designing new visual metaphors to bridge the gap between immersion and object representation. Finally, it proposes several design recommendations for enhancing the usability of immersive virtual reality systems through incorporating more naturalist concepts into VR environments. 

# 2.概念术语说明
In this section, we will define some important terms and concepts used in this article.
1. Immersive Virtual Reality(IVR): This term refers to virtual reality where the viewpoint is shifted out of the player’s head and given to a completely different world. The objective behind creating an IVR system is to immerse players in a foreign environment while enabling them to explore, interact with various objects, learn about culture, languages, etc.

2. Natural Visual Metaphor: A natural visual metaphor is a way of representing objects using familiar scenes or elements of nature. For example, one could use a tree to represent the oak trees seen in Victoria Park, Canada. 

3. Simulated Environment: In a simulated environment, various objects are placed in a virtual space and rendered as if they exist naturally in the surrounding environment. These simulated objects have additional characteristics like color, size, shape, texture, and movement.

4. Real-Time Tracking: Real-time tracking means that each device or sensor tracks the position and orientation of the entire body during interaction with the simulation. Tracking enables accurate synchronization and allows the game engine to update the simulation at a consistent frame rate.

5. Cognitive Load: Cognitive load refers to the amount of mental effort required to process information. In a VR context, there can be significant cognitive load when interacting with objects and understanding their relationships, properties, functions, and behaviors.

# 3.核心算法原理及操作步骤
This section will cover the algorithms employed in this project and explain the steps involved. 
1. Perception: During training, participants were asked to identify the features of a target animal, plant, or object present in their surroundings. Each feature was represented graphically using standard images such as flowers, birds, buildings, vehicles, and mountains. Once identified, participants were instructed to group similar objects together based on similarity criteria such as proximity, geometry, or motion. This knowledge was stored in memory bank so that it can be accessed whenever needed.

2. Touch Gestures: Participants were instructed to touch the surface of the presented object or feature to reveal its underlying structure or behavior. This practice encouraged participants to pay attention to details and gain insights into the function and behavior of the target object.

3. Physical Action Feedback: When participants perform actions, feedback was provided visually and audibly to help them evaluate whether their movements had resulted in correct or incorrect outcomes. For instance, if participants tried to climb over an obstacle, audio and visual cues indicated that they should stop trying. Similarly, when participants made mistakes in navigation, audio and haptic cues helped them detect and correct these errors.

4. Deviation and Steering: During training, participants were asked to make deviations from the recommended path in the simulation and steer themselves towards the desired direction. This exercise allowed participants to become comfortable with deviation control and reduce the risk of falling into traps.

5. Animation and Movement Synchronization: Since animation is closely tied with movement and physics simulations, two separate engines were developed to synchronize them accurately. The first engine tracked the movement of each object and updated the corresponding animation accordingly. The second engine captured input from controllers and applied it to the simulation directly without any lag or delay. This ensured smooth motion and increased consistency across devices.

6. Object Interactions: To enable interactions with objects within the simulation, simple gestures and sound signals were utilized. For example, swipes along the ground or mice clicks on tires would trigger sounds and animations to indicate damage or deformation respectively.

# 4.具体代码实例及解释说明
Here's an example code snippet to demonstrate the implementation of a spatial database using MongoDB for storing the objects' attributes and categories. This code assumes that all objects being presented in the IVR session belong to one of three categories i.e., animals, plants, or objects.
