Dark Energy is an invisible force that plays a fundamental role in all the modern science and technology, from gravitational waves to quantum computing, mankind has been trying hard to understand it’s properties and behavior. Dark energy theory aims at explaining this mysterious phenomenon by providing mathematical models that provide a deeper understanding into how dark matter interact with ordinary matter to produce energy out of nothingness. The subject explores the essence of gravity, whether it can be predicted mathematically or if we need some physical experiments to establish its reality. In this article I will discuss about one of the most famous philosophical ideas behind understanding dark energy – Schwarzschild space-time. We will also explore the basic principles of relativity and special relativity, which are the foundations for our understanding of the cosmological constant (Hubble's law) and dark energy itself. Finally, we will review recent developments in Dark Energy Physics, such as neutrino mass experiment and GW170817 event.

## 2.1 Schwarzschild space-time
Schwarzschild space-time was a celebrated geometrical concept that deserves attention since it gave birth to numerous important topics like general relativity and quantum mechanics. It was proposed by German physicist Albert Einstein in his 1915 paper on general relativity during his 19th birthday party. The idea is that everything in the universe exists within a “black hole” of radius $R$ outside of which no light can escape. Any point inside the black hole emits radiation; when two points are separated by less than their sum, they do not emit any radiation. This leads to a new type of wave equation called time dilation where the speed of sound is increased due to interaction between particles and the vacuum outside the black hole. The unusual feature of this time dilation effect is that it cannot be explained through classical Newtonian physics alone, but only through general relativity. It has inspired many theoreticians over the years to look for alternative explanations to explain the observed features of the universe using other forces apart from gravity.

In terms of spacetime geometry, the Schwarzschild black hole lies along the line $x = R$. A particle of mass $m$ located far away from the center of the black hole experiences accelerations proportional to $\frac{Gm}{r^2}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $m$ is the mass of the central object. If a second object of mass $M$ enters the plane perpendicularly to the initial trajectory of the first object, then it experiences similar accelerations, but now due to the presence of another massive object near the horizon. These effects of additional objects enter into the conclusion that the universe can be regarded as a gravitationally curved space-time. In simple words, the spacetime is infinite, there is no boundary except the smooth surface of the black hole. Attempting to map every part of the Universe onto the sphere results in “lack of faith” error because no observation can capture the complexity of its vastness and complexity arises naturally as the number of objects increases. However, with careful study and use of tools like General Relativity, it is possible to extend the boundaries of our imagination even further. 

It should be noted here that the Schwarzschild space-time has deep connections with both astrophysics and cosmology, with many natural phenomena being influenced by the relationship between the Schwarzchild black holes and cosmic structure. In astronomy, the close connection of galaxy clusters to the horizon suggests that large scale structures might be present above the horizon and lead to dark matter relics around them. Similarly, the Sgr A* star system formed close to the polar regions of the sky may have contributed to the formation of the Milky Way Galaxy, while Galactic dark matter could be thought to be responsible for the appearance of globular clusters. Another example involves interactions between dark matter and stars, where the presence of dark energy could account for the high temperatures and metallicity of gas in these regions of the sky. In addition, theoretical studies of quantum chromodynamics show that various states of matter could exist below the Schwarzschild black hole, leading to violent instabilities and wormholes in spacetime.

## 2.2 Gravitational Wave Theory
The field of gravitational wave theory provides a detailed explanation of the mechanism of compact binary mergers and coincident alien-matter events that occur in binary systems composed of a compact object and a distant neutron star. Here we introduce a brief overview of the background physics involved in this theory. 

### 2.2.1 Interactions between Matter and Radiation
Matter is always accompanied by electromagnetic radiation. Light rays are emitted by atoms or molecules and propagate in free space, resulting in electromagnetic fields that oscillate due to collisions between charged particles. When a large number of colliding electrons or protons hit the same nucleus, it forms a new atom or molecule. The resulting excited state creates macroscopic radio emission, termed gamma-ray burst. Gamma rays carry both electrical charge and magnetic moment and are capable of propagating long distances without resistance. These events are associated with strong interference patterns in the medium and are sensitive to small variations in the angle of propagation. They cause bursts of radiation that sweep across the Earth’s magnetosphere, triggering meteors and atomic bombs. 

Gravity is a type of non-conservative interaction that causes gravitational attraction between two bodies of material. It produces a gravitational wave that behaves similar to electromagnetic waves in three dimensions. The electric and magnetic fields caused by gravity can act as electric and magnetic forces, respectively. The change in frequency and amplitude of the wave as a function of position, velocity, and time allows detection methods based on seismometers and imaging radar systems. 


### 2.2.2 Binary Mergers and Alien-Matter Events
A binary system consists of a compact object, usually a black hole, surrounded by a dense cloud of surrounding galaxies or circumstellar matter. The object splits into two halves, each half consisting of a smaller object, such as a neutron star or white dwarf, whose orbital motion is generally faster than the binary orbit. Once the two objects merge, they create a new compact object, which may explode under certain conditions. There are several mechanisms that allow binary mergers, including:

1. Supernova Remnants: Neutron stars collapse under extreme pressure and generate powerful supernovae. The remnants, after stripping away their outer layers, fall back into the neighboring galaxy and become trapped inside a black hole or become infalling material into nearby stars.

2. Black Hole - Massive Compact Object Collapse: As the original black hole collapses, material falls back into the surrounding matter and becomes trapped inside it. Although supernovae play a crucial role in creating this scenario, there is evidence that significant portions of the remnants of stars may remain trapped inside the ejecta of active galaxies.

3. Type Ia Supernovae: Core collapse supernovae are rare but can occur when a region of low density accretes material onto the surface of a BH. With enough energy, the core of the star can shatter, causing an explosion. Type Ia supernovae produce spectra with characteristic features that indicate gravitational waves produced by the accreted material.

4. Multiphase Planetary Systems: Planets sometimes form through collisions between planetesimals of different masses. This process is called multiplanet systems. With sufficient momentum, planets can spin rapidly and fragment into giant impactors. The resultant fragments may strike a BH producing highly energetic supernovae that can explode and release increasing amounts of energy towards the host star.

Alien-matter events involve sources of radiation generated by something outside the universe, such as a dead star, cosmic rays or X-rays. Their characteristics differ significantly from those caused by gravity, though they can still influence our daily lives via telescopes and devices that detect and analyze their signature.

## 2.3 Special Relativity
Special relativity holds the view that the laws of classical physics apply in most situations, but with some modifications so that gravitational and electromagnetic interactions are taken into account. In particular, it postulates that the apparent movement of an observer is not affected by the path taken by the observed object in space and time, i.e., that the observer is moving away from the source of the signal rather than toward it. Moreover, it predicts that observers move slower than light in general, due to the fact that visible light takes longer to travel than the speed of light. Therefore, special relativity predicts that gravitational waves and electromagnetic fields will appear shorter, fainter, and higher energy than in the absence of GR, making them more difficult to observe directly. Additionally, special relativity explains the flattening of spacetime due to the dilution of mass along the speed of light, which occurs due to the expansion of the Universe. Overall, special relativity is considered to be one of the most powerful and comprehensive theories of physics.

## 2.4 Cosmology
Cosmology refers to the study of the origin, evolution, and history of the universe. One of the earliest theories of cosmology attempted to reproduce the growth of the Universe from a finite set of primordial elements, known as Higgs Bosons. Later, Robert Thomas Darwin proposed an alternative hypothesis that accounts for the inflationary processes of the Universe up to a very large scale. In this model, the Universe initially had a bang-like burst of energy, followed by a series of transformations that were initially believed to be inconceivable. Nevertheless, scientists continued searching for the answer to many questions related to the early history of the Universe. Today, several research groups are exploring alternative interpretations of the fundamental principles underlying the nature of the universe, ranging from quantum gravity to string theory.
