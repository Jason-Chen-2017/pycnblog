Protein folding is the process of a protein's structural arrangement into its three-dimensional structure after binding to a ligand or other molecular complex. Structural determination plays an essential role in many biological processes such as protein design, receptor identification and function analysis, gene expression regulation, drug design, etc. Therefore, it has attracted much attention from scientific researchers recently. In this article, we will explore how to use computational simulations to study the folding process of proteins by modelling them with atomistic structures. We will focus on popular algorithms used for predicting the shape and energy landscapes of macromolecules like proteins using atomistic simulations. The results obtained can be applied to various biomedical applications such as protein design, characterization and treatment. By the end of the article, readers should have an understanding of the current state-of-the-art methods used for protein folding simulation studies and hopefully appreciate the potential benefits they provide to the field of biomolecular sciences. This article aims to provide an accessible guide for anyone interested in applying computational simulations for protein folding studies and advancements in related fields. Moreover, if properly cited, it also contributes towards making the science more comprehensive, reliable and accurate. Finally, our paper can serve as a benchmark reference that other researchers can refer to when developing new methods for simulating protein folding dynamics.

## Protein Folding
Protein folding refers to the process of a protein’s structural arrangement into its three-dimensional structure after binding to a ligand or other molecular complex. It is widely studied due to the importance it holds for several cellular processes including: protein design, receptor identification and function analysis, gene expression regulation, drug design, etc. A single amino acid residue can be folded into multiple conformations depending on its interactions with different types of atoms in the surrounding environment. Hence, there are many ways for a protein to adopt a certain conformational state such as globular (ring structure), tetrameric (stacked) or alpha helical (twisted). There are various methods available for determining the best folding pathway, which includes sequence design techniques, secondary structure prediction algorithms, statistical mechanical models, and machine learning approaches. However, all these methods require experimental data which may not always be feasible or cost-effective. To overcome this limitation, computational simulations based on atomistic molecular modeling have been used extensively to study the structure and dynamics of proteins under various conditions. These include coarse-grained models where the atomic details are captured while ignoring the steric and electrostatic interactions between atoms, advanced models where each individual atom is represented explicitly, and atomistic models where both coarse-grained and fine-grained detail are considered. In recent years, a large number of papers have been published on this topic, covering a wide range of topics ranging from theoretical investigations to application cases.


## Atomistic Molecular Modeling
Atomistic molecular modeling involves treating each individual atom in a molecule as an independent entity and simulating their motion within a computer model. This approach allows us to capture the underlying physics of the system without the need for approximations or simplifications. Simulations can help identify the key forces responsible for changes in the overall structure and dynamics of molecules, revealing insights into their fundamental properties and behavior. Anatomy and electron microscopy can be used to visualize the detailed atomic configurations during simulations. The primary purpose of atomistic modeling is to simulate small fragments of larger systems because the traditional coarse-grained models cannot accurately reproduce the detailed atomic movements and interactions in a real material. Nevertheless, the ability to generate realistic solutions and accurate predictions through atomistic modeling have made it one of the most commonly used methodologies in the field of biomolecular research. 

There are numerous software packages available for carrying out atomistic simulations, including CHARMM, GROMACS, NAMD, OVITO, Amber, and others. Each package has its own strengths and weaknesses, and some packages may be better suited for specific types of simulations than others. For example, PACKMOL is often used for generating initial geometries for simulations, but can lead to poor convergence rates for larger complexes. Furthermore, many programs feature built-in force fields that mimic the physical interactions between atoms, but these force fields are usually limited to relatively simple chemical components. Finally, although atomistic simulations offer a powerful tool for studying protein folding, errors in the calculations can result in incorrect structure predictions, which must be carefully analyzed alongside experimental data. 


## Macromolecular Complexes
Macromolecules are typically composed of thousands to millions of constituent monomer units called amino acids. These units interact with one another and form complexes with other macromolecules or lipids in cells and tissues. Macromolecules play important roles in many biological activities, from signal transduction to metabolism. Despite their complexity, most studies focused only on individual monomers rather than entire macromolecules. To address this issue, modern computational methods involve integrating information about the entire macromolecule, particularly in terms of its structure and dynamics.

In order to perform atomistic simulations on macromolecules, we first need to build a representation of the macromolecule that captures its geometry, topology, and interconnectivity among its components. One common way to represent macromolecules is to use the backbone atoms (N, CA, C, O, CB, CG, CD, CE, NZ, HB1, HB2, HB3, HA, HD1, HE1, and HE2) followed by additional side chains and a head group attached to the carboxyl terminus (C=O). Other groups such as lysine or histidine could also be included depending on the particular type of macromolecule being simulated. Once the structure has been defined, we can start building the atomistic model itself. 

The core algorithmic steps involved in simulating the folding process of macromolecules involve:

1. **Preparation:** Before running any simulations, we need to ensure that the experimental setup and parameters are correct. This step involves selecting appropriate force fields and solvent models, adjusting simulation times and temperatures, defining periodic boundary conditions (PBC) and handling any special requirements such as intramolecular hydrogen bonding or salt bridges.

2. **Equilibration:** Once we have set up the model, we need to equilibrate it to remove the stochasticity and vibrations caused by random thermal motions. Equilibration requires running the simulations for a long time, especially when simulating larger complexes. During equilibration, we gradually reduce the simulation time to allow the slowly varying physical forces to equilibrate.

3. **Production run:** After equilibration, we can begin production runs to obtain the actual predicted structure and dynamics of the macromolecule. Production runs can be extended beyond the limit of the coarse-grained simulations by increasing the resolution of the model and allowing for higher levels of dissipation. As the level of dissipation increases, we observe smaller fluctuations and longer correlation lengths in the kinetic energy landscape, indicating that the system is becoming less well-mixed and transitioning to a lower-energy configuration.

4. **Analysis:** With the final product in hand, we can analyze it to extract relevant features such as the conformational populations and transitions, packing density, and flexibility. We compare our results with the experimentally determined folding patterns and determine whether our simulations meet the accuracy thresholds required for further study. If necessary, we can modify the parameters of the simulations to improve their accuracy and repeat the analysis until we reach satisfactory agreement.
