## Cryptocurrencies
Bitcoin is the most famous example of a decentralized crypto currency. It was launched in January 2009 by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. After Bitcoin, other blockchains such as Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Ripple have also emerged. These blockchain networks are built using decentralized technologies like proof of work (POW) and proof of stake (POS). They enable fast transactions and allow users to transact without intermediaries. The use cases of these blockchains range from gaming applications, payment systems, social media platforms, etc. To be specific, Bitcoin has been used to purchase goods and services online, allowing people around the world to communicate, share knowledge, make financial transactions, and engage in economic activity. Apart from its use cases, many exchanges offer trading, lending, staking, or storing of cryptocurrencies. Therefore, proper taxation plays a crucial role in managing cryptocurrencies effectively. 

In this article, we will discuss how cryptocurrencies can be properly managed based on their technical architecture and ecological features. We will introduce various taxes that may apply to cryptocurrencies specifically, and explain how they function within the system and interact with each other. We will then provide detailed examples on how some common scenarios arise due to incorrect tax management practice. Lastly, we will conclude by discussing current trends in cryptocurrency tax policies and evaluate future tax reforms needed to enhance public interest and transparency in cryptocurrency transactions.



## 2.Basic concepts and terminology
Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that do not rely on central authorities to secure and govern their transactions. Instead, they operate independently from banks, clearinghouses, or any governmental institution. Thus, there are several key differences between traditional monetary assets and cryptocurrencies:

1. Taxonomy of Crypto Currencies - There are three main types of cryptocurrencies:

1.1 Decentralized Currencies – These include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other projects that run solely on blockchain technology. These currencies are secured and governed by distributed consensus algorithms that are resistant to manipulation or control by powerful entities. 

1.2 Centralized Exchanges - These include exchanges that maintain control over user funds and trade them directly with third parties. Traditional fiat money backed stablecoins typically fall into this category since they are controlled by governments and cannot guarantee availability or reliability. Examples include Uniswap, SushiSwap, Gemini, and Kraken.

1.3 “Token” Equivalents - These include tokens created on top of existing protocols and serve as security, utility, or investment vehicles for different applications. Examples include Binance Coin (BNB), Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA).

Taxonomy of Crypto Currencies: This categorization helps identify the essential characteristics of each type of cryptocurrency. In general, all decentralized currencies have similar properties while token equivalents typically have unique functionalities depending on their implementation details. However, no two currencies are identical and hence must be handled differently under various circumstances.

2. Types of Taxes applied to Crypto Currencies - There are four major categories of taxes applicable to cryptocurrencies:

2.1 Governing Bodies’ Taxes - These represent income tax imposed by state and federal agencies responsible for collecting taxes from citizens. For instance, US securities and exchange commission (SEC) imposes state and local income taxes on companies engaged in trading stocks or cryptoassets. UK taxpayers pay income tax on cryptocurrencies earned through mining operations. Some countries also charge foreign transaction fees charged by customers using cryptocurrencies outside their country of origin.

2.2 Mining and Staking Taxes - Many cryptocurrencies have dedicated hardware infrastructure that requires mining or staking to generate new coins. Understanding these procedures and determining appropriate rates can impact the profitability and stability of the network. Various jurisdictions across the globe require slightly different rate structures for certain currencies and activities. For instance, Canada requires a different tax rate for investing in bitcoin miners than those who hold traditional securities. Additionally, large exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance Charge different fee structures depending on the volume of trades and accounts.

2.3 Transaction Fees Charges - Most decentralized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDC charge a small percentage of the total value of the transaction as a transaction fee. However, some high-frequency trading bots such as Zerion also collect small amounts of fees in order to cover operational costs associated with their automated trading strategies. Ultimately, these fees impact the overall marketplace and need to be carefully managed.

2.4 Transaction Reversal Charges - Occasionally, a customer may wish to withdraw their cryptocurrency balance but mistakenly send it to an invalid address. Typically, exchanges may charge a small fee for this scenario because it reduces the risk of losing access to their fund. Regardless of the cause, the legal mandate behind these charges varies by jurisdiction and should always be understood before being incurred.

3. Technological Architecture of Blockchain Networks - Each blockchain network consists of several nodes that participate in validating transactions and generating blocks. The structure of these networks differs significantly depending on the protocol and algorithm used. The following sections describe some common elements found in typical blockchain architectures:

**Nodes**: Nodes are computer programs running on servers or computers connected to the Internet that help validate transactions and create blocks. All decentralized cryptocurrencies typically use peer-to-peer (P2P) networking model wherein each node maintains a copy of the ledger and communicates with others to reach consensus about the transaction history. Other models involve permissioned and permissionless blockchains, where only authorized participants join the network and remain anonymous until explicitly revealed.

**Consensus Mechanism:** Consensus mechanisms ensure that all nodes agree on the same transaction history. They are designed to handle competing demands from multiple actors, including spammers attempting to cheat the network, and prevent malicious attacks such as double spending or sybil attackers trying to manipulate network votes. Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) are two popular consensus mechanisms used in decentralized cryptocurrencies. PoW involves creating computational tasks that take significant amount of electricity and resources to solve, while PoS relies on voting power held by token holders to obtain rewards.

**Transaction Pool:** Transaction pools store pending transactions waiting to be included in the next block. Once a miner selects a set of transactions, he broadcasts them to the entire network so that other nodes can verify their validity and add them to their own ledgers if valid. If a miner fails to receive enough confirmations, his shares may be slashed and removed from the network.

**Block Chain:** Block chains contain all transactions that have been validated and approved by the network. They act as a permanent record of all transactions ever made, which allows anyone to verify the integrity and correctness of the chain at any given point in time. New blocks are added every ten minutes on average, making the chain very secure even against attackers. Despite the popularity of blockchain technology, there exist risks associated with it, especially when interacting with external systems and networks.
