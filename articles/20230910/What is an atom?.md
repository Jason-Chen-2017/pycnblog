## Atom是什么？
An atom is the basic unit of a chemical element and a building block for organic compounds. It consists of a set of protons (positive electric charge) and neutrons (neutral atoms that orbit around it). An atom is classified into different types such as: proton, neutron, nucleus, electron or quark. Atoms can form various molecular entities like molecules, liquids, solids, etc., which are made up of multiple atoms working together. The three major elements containing one or more atoms are Hydrogen(H), Carbon(C), and Oxygen(O). 

Atom's structure varies slightly between different elements due to their unique properties. In this article we will discuss about basics of Atoms, i.e. what they are, how do they function, how they interact with other atoms, and why these concepts matter in our lives. We will also look at some interesting applications of atoms, and understand where they have been used before and after present day times. Let's get started!

# 2. Basic Concepts & Terms
## Atoms vs Molecules
The two main divisions of matter into small particles called atoms and molecules follow from classical physics. Atoms exist independently but only when bound together make up molecules. Therefore, atoms act as constituent particles within molecules, while molecules act as larger entities composed of multiple interconnected atoms. When separated, atomic structures become separate entities and no longer hold any meaningful physical significance alone. However, by combining several atoms to form a molecule, complex interactions emerge across distinct regions of space-time, resulting in chemical reactions and processes that change both the nature and behavior of matter.   

In summary, atoms are fundamental building blocks of matter, consisting of a positive charge surrounded by neutral electrons orbiting around it. They belong to either the electron cloud or the quark model of quantum mechanics, depending on their spin state. Within each chemical element, atoms form specific sets of atoms based on their valence shell configuration. This arrangement results in bonding patterns, crystal structures, electronic configurations, and many other factors influencing its physical and chemical properties.    

Molecules are collections of interconnected atoms that exhibit certain macroscopic properties because they are relatively simple systems that behave much alike than complicated atomic systems. Common examples include water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, chlorine, and benzene. These molecules share common structural characteristics and bond connectivity patterns, making them easier to combine and process.  

Overall, both atoms and molecules are essential components of all living things' bodies, providing energy storage, movement, vibration control, and catalysis functions. The complexity of life comes from their interaction with environmental stresses, heredity, genetics, and biochemical pathways. Understanding the fundamental principles behind both natural and artificial atoms, molecules, and the structure of their interactions will be key to better understanding our world and design new materials and technologies for human advancement. 

## Protons and Neutrons
Each atom has two principal subatomic particles, called protons and neutrons, that must always coexist in balance. Protons possess positive electric charge, whereas neutrons have zero charge. They work together to create the chemical basis for the stable electron cloud surrounding each atom. Because there are only two possible charges, half the mass of a particle needs to be assigned to either a proton or a neutron. The difference in electrical potential between these two charged species determines whether the particle becomes electronegative or electrophilic, respectively.   



Electron clouds are usually created by giving half of the electron mass to one of the electron pair, creating a neutron that binds to another atom's nucleus and provides a smaller chunk of positively charged electron energy. Together, these atoms make up a full electron cloud surrounded by the neutral nuclei of other atoms, helping to conduct electromagnetic radiation and carry away heat during fission and fusion reactions.
