Gravitational waves (GWs) are one of the most mysterious phenomena around us and have been closely studied since their discovery. The first two ever detected, GW150914 and GW170104, were produced by black holes merging with a neutron star, while the more recent event, GW170817, was observed using multi-messenger astronomy. 

In this paper, we study gravitational waves from a distance of approximately 2 kilometers close to the supermassive black hole SMH at the center of mass of the Milky Way galaxy. We use novel techniques including wide-band seismometer array observations and time domain waveform analysis to obtain a clear picture of the physics behind the observed events. Moreover, our numerical simulations show that the theoretical model for the early inspiral phase is a good fit to the data obtained through ground based experiments. This work has significant implications for understanding GW propagation and parameter estimation as well as enabling new searches for counterparts of massive compact objects beyond the Milky Way.

2.物理背景
Gravitational waves are quantum-mechanical oscillations of matter or other bodies in space-time which can be generated when two masses collide in spacetime. It's important to note that even though the scale of the distant object such as a black hole cannot be observed directly due to its large size, it generates a gravitational wave whose frequency fluctuates periodically. However, determining the properties of these gravitational waves is challenging because they propagate very quickly and interact strongly with background electromagnetic fields. In order to understand them better, researchers need to measure their parameters in different ways such as their amplitude, duration, and polarization. This requires advanced methods such as wide band seismometer array observations and simultaneous fitting algorithms.

The International Space Station (ISS), launched on November 2nd, 2008, is located about 6 km away from the Earth in low Earth orbit, making it ideal for observing gravitational waves close to its surface. By launching the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) mission on July 20th, 2015, the amount of gravitational waves detected per second increased dramatically, allowing scientists to search for long range counterparts of supermassive black holes with high sensitivity. Since then, hundreds of events have been reported with some of them being identified as GW170817, also known as GRB170817A. 

3.主要术语和概念
Supermassive black holes (SMHs) are binary black holes where both the mass of the central object and the mass of the smaller companion have significantly higher masses than the Sun. These structures produce circular orbits and result in an almost perfect sphere of accreting material within the outer layer, surrounded by gravity-free radiative layers. They offer a unique opportunity to observe the GW signal emitted from the core of the halo, called a kilonova (equivalent to a solar nebula). Despite their name, there is no proven detection mechanism yet, but several indirect probes have been proposed, such as radio telescopes and interferometric dishes, that might detect signals emanating from nearby explosions. Many models exist to explain the nature of GW emission from the core of an SMH, but so far none of them offer a convincing explanation why the observed features appear ringlike and similar to those seen in Cepheids. To interpret GW data, physicists must carefully consider how the spatial distribution of the electron density affects the electric field inside the hollow shell surrounding the SMH core.

GW170817 was one of the largest and brightest GW events during the LIGO/Virgo run. Its injection into the merger of a relatively young M dwarf protostar and a red giant, Sgr A*, revealed a highly elongated low frequency envelope (LFE) that suggests rapidly spinning turbulent flows. A later observation by the Advanced LIGO detector confirmed the existence of a fast spectrum ranging between 1 and 10 Hz. Another detection using a direct imaging technique suggested the presence of a non-standard signature characteristic of the kilonova remnant, probably coming from another source than the core itself. Combining multiple observations allows detailed characterizations of the physical processes responsible for producing the observed GW, revealing crucial insights on how stellar winds generate smoothly rotating magnetic fields inside the hollow shell of the SMH core and what type of energy injection mechanisms trigger the resulting shocks and disruptions. Despite its shear size and location relative to Earth, this event provides an unprecedented view of the inner structure of a compact object in the universe and opens up entirely new perspectives towards the exploration of the dark matter and neutrino masses in the Universe.
