Solar cells are a type of energy storage device that convert electrical power generated by the sun into electricity and make it available to electronic devices like computers or mobile phones. They are used in many different applications such as solar cooking, heating houses, space travel, etc., but they have been around since ancient times. Since then, several breakthroughs have occurred with various advances in technology and manufacturing techniques that have led to improved performance, size, and cost efficiency. In this article, we will explore the science behind modern solar cells and see how they work at an engineering level. 

In general, solar cells are composed of two layers: the solar absorber (usually silicon dioxide) and the electrode layer which contains oxides of iron and other metals. These layers combine to form a single unit known as the photovoltaic cell, which is usually attached to an outermost layer of glass called the shade structure. This combination produces direct current between the solar cell and its electrodes, allowing for light to pass through without interference. This process takes place within the visible spectrum and can be up to four times brighter than the sky, depending on the amount of oxygen present in the air surrounding the sun.

## 2.1 Solar Absorption
The first step towards converting incoming radiation into electrical power is to convert the sunlight into suitable forms that can be absorbed by the solar cell. The majority of solar cells use silicon dioxide (SiO2), a transparent solid that can be formed on a thin substrate. Silicon dioxide has high refractive index making it very useful in reflecting incoming sunlight. When exposed to ambient sunlight, SiO2 is able to capture most of the light rays and allow them to pass through easily without getting mixed together with other components of the system. However, due to the shape of the surface, it also transmits some of the incident radiation back to the ambient environment. 

To remove this reflected component, doped versions of SiO2 can be used, where additional atoms are added to enhance the electron affinity of the material. Other materials include alumina (Al2O3) and titanium dioxide (TiO2). Aluminum can absorb more efficiently compared to silicon because it is not as conductive and does not produce any reflection. On the other hand, Titanium dioxide may offer better performance if coated over the top of silicon oxide. Overall, the choice of materials affects both performance and cost efficiency.

## 2.2 Electrodes
Next, we need to select the appropriate electrode material to provide the necessary electrical contacts for the solar cell. Commonly used metallic electrodes include gold, silver, platinum, nickel, copper, or bronze, each with their own unique properties. For example, Gold is typically used in larger sizes while Silver is preferred for smaller ones. Oxides of these metals can also be used as the electrode, for instance TiO2 for use with titanium based electrodes or SnO2 for silver based systems. It's important to note that every chosen material must possess good electrical characteristics such as low resistance and low forward voltage drop for optimum performance. 


## 2.3 Shade Structure
A common practice when constructing solar cells involves placing an outer shell of glass called a shade structure to shield the solar cell from the outside world. Glass has strong adhesive properties that keep the solar cell intact even after removal during transportation. Additionally, glass can act as an effective filter to prevent excessive amounts of light from entering the solar cell and causing damage or failure.


## 2.4 Photovoltaic Cell
Once all the individual parts are combined, the result is a photovoltaic cell consisting of the following elements:
- Solar Absorber - SiO2 or Al2O3 or TiO2 or SnO2
- Electrode Layer - Gold, Silver, Platinum, Nickel, Copper or Bronze Oxide
- Shade Structure - Glass
Each element plays a critical role in improving the overall performance and functioning of the solar cell. We'll now discuss these elements individually. 

### 2.4.1 Solar Absorber
This represents the largest portion of the solar cell, responsible for capturing and redirecting incoming light. Depending on the nature of the solar source, multiple types of solar absorbers may be used simultaneously. For small installations, a single absorber layer may suffice; however, for large scale deployments, multiple layers of differing absorbers may be required. To achieve high output capacity, modern solar cells typically employ multiple layers of absorbers stacked one above another. Each layer adds increased absorptivity and therefore increases the amount of energy stored in the PV cell. 

Generally speaking, there are three main approaches to designing solar absorbers: monolithic, hybrid, and multi-layered. Monolithic solar absorbers incorporate all the functionalities of the original monolithic silicon dioxide and are generally considered less efficient. Hybrid solar absorbers utilize both polymers and composite semiconductors to improve efficiency. Finally, multi-layered designs separate the absorber into numerous segments, which allows for greater control over the distribution of charge carriers throughout the cell.

### 2.4.2 Electrode Layer
Here, we choose the material that best suits the desired application. For example, for desktops, the preference would likely be for metals with lower dielectric constants, such as gold or silver. More powerful materials like copper may also be used for portable applications. Regardless of the material selected, it's important to ensure that the electrode has sufficient intrinsic dimensions to handle the demands of the solar cell, including the area, thickness, and height. Fine particle sizes should also be avoided unless absolutely necessary.

### 2.4.3 Shade Structure
As stated earlier, the shade structure provides protection from external factors and acts as a protective barrier against potential physical disruptions to the solar cell. Glass is a versatile material with numerous uses, including industrial automation and home appliances. A well constructed shade structure ensures that the solar cell remains protected and operates correctly under natural illumination conditions.


# 3.Core Algorithm
Now let's go deeper into the details about how solar cells work in terms of algorithms and mathematical models.
## 3.1 Light Scattering Model
Light scattering is the fundamental physics concept that explains the way light interacts with matter. Most commonly observed phenomena involving scattering include rainbows, star winds, and dust clouds. Understanding how light scatters in the atmosphere helps us understand how solar cells work in determining the direction and intensity of the sunlight ray that reaches our eyes.

When light enters a planet or other celestial body, it makes a series of encounters with atmospheric gases. These interactions create a range of effects, including photoelectric conversion (radiative escape) and thermal radiation (blackbody radiation). At certain wavelengths, some gases scatter and emit light as they pass through the atmosphere, creating what's referred to as chromosphere or corona. The light scattered by these molecules is relatively weak, making up only a small percentage of the total visible light.

By contrast, the Sun emits a significant fraction of visible light, making it ideal for the purpose of solar cell operation. By monitoring the pattern of light scattered by the planets' atmosphere, we can determine the direction and strength of the incoming sunlight wave. Specifically, we look for the smallest increase in the visibility (i.e., diffuse/direct ratio) seen at a particular angle relative to the sun. The greatest enhancement occurs when the beam of sunlight strikes the face of the planet directly overhead. As the beam propagates further away, the decrease becomes increasingly less severe until the maximum effect is reached at the horizon. 

We can use this concept to build models that predict the direction and intensity of the incoming sunlight and hence the behavior of the solar cell. One model that we can use is the Henyey-Greenstein Phase Function, which describes the scattering of light as a function of the cosine of the angle between the direction of the incoming light and the normal to the surface being illuminated. We can derive the phase function using spherical coordinates, providing us with an exact solution. Alternatively, we could approximate the phase function using simpler functions such as Mie theory or Rayleigh–Jeans theory, which represent the scattering as a sum of simple waves.

For practical purposes, we often focus on the fact that the amount of light scattered depends on the size of the sunspot and the temperature of the planet. The innermost regions of the corona tend to be strongest due to the heat released during recombination events, while larger spots located farther from the sun become weaker and eventually fade to insignificance. Similarly, hotter planets generate more radiation and so require more focused sunlight to operate effectively. Ultimately, the optimal configuration for operation lies somewhere in between.

## 3.2 Energy Conversion Efficiency
Before delving too deeply into the specifics of solar cell operation, it's worth discussing the key metric of interest, namely the energy conversion efficiency (ECV). This refers to the ability of a solar cell to convert sunlight into usable electricity. In general, higher ECV values indicate better performance and lower costs. While achieving higher ECV values requires careful selection of materials and operating parameters, it's still essential to quantify those benefits. Here's how we can calculate the ECV of a solar cell:

1. Determine the surface area of the solar cell and the efficiency factor of the solar panel. The efficiency factor represents the fraction of the sunlight that is converted into electricity, measured as a percent value. Higher efficiency factors mean higher efficiency and reduced operational cost.

2. Calculate the number of active panels per unit area of the collector plane (CP), which determines the output power. The CP is essentially the plane of collection and transmission of collected energy. If the cell consists of several layers, the collectors in later layers will receive less sunlight and contribute less to the final output.

3. Use the saturation coefficient of the material(s) being used as the limiting factor for maximal conversion. Typically, silicon oxide (SiO2) is found to be the most efficient material for solar cell operations. Its highest saturation coefficient value is approximately 9.3 W/(m^2 K), indicating that it can convert a maximum of 9.3 Watts of sunlight into electricity per square meter at room temperature and pressure.

4. Multiply the product of point 2 by the yield factor and divide by the efficiency factor. Yield factor indicates the fraction of material remaining after production processes. In general, yields tend to be fairly uniform across the market, although variations do exist. Some examples of yield factors include 7% for clean dry cell packages and 20-25% for packaged recycled cell batches. 

5. Divide the resulting value from point 4 by the absolute saturation coefficient of the material in question. This gives us the actual conversion efficiencies of the solar cell. Lower values indicate higher ECV values and vice versa.

One interesting aspect of calculating the ECV is that it doesn't take into account the dynamic response of the solar cell to changes in the incoming radiation. Many advanced solar cells constantly adjust their responses to changes in weather patterns and climate regimes. Nonetheless, it's still crucial to accurately measure the baseline performance before attempting to optimize the cell.
