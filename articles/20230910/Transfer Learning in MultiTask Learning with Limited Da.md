Multi-task learning (MTL) has become a popular technique for training machine learning models on multiple tasks simultaneously with limited data. In this article, we will discuss the transfer learning approach to MTL and how it can help improve model performance in scenarios where there is little or no labeled data available. We will also present an algorithm called Transfer Sampling (TS) that helps reduce the amount of labeled data required during fine-tuning of pre-trained language models such as BERT and GPT-2 by using unlabeled data from other tasks within the same MTL setting. The experimental results show that TS significantly reduces the number of labels required to train the models compared to standard MTL approaches while maintaining high accuracy levels.
In addition to addressing the problem of limited labeled data, our work offers insights into why existing multi-task learning methods fail when there are few or no labeled examples for some tasks. It provides practical guidance on how to design effective strategies for choosing appropriate task representations and datasets for different subtasks, which may lead to significant improvements in model performance. Overall, our work demonstrates the importance of carefully considering transfer learning techniques for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of multi-task learning systems.
# 2.背景介绍
Multi-task learning (MTL) refers to the process of training a single deep neural network on multiple related tasks with shared parameters. Traditional methods have focused on building separate models for each task, requiring extensive amounts of annotated data per task. However, recent advances in large-scale language modeling have enabled the development of powerful language models capable of solving many natural language processing tasks at once. These models use massive amounts of unstructured text data that cannot be easily labeled, but they can still learn useful representations from their contextualized word embeddings. To take advantage of these pretrained models, researchers have proposed various strategies for incorporating them into multi-task settings, including feature extraction, knowledge distillation, and transfer learning. However, most of these methods require extensive computational resources and do not always provide significant improvement over baseline models. This leaves a question: Can transfer learning techniques be leveraged to further enhance MTL models when limited labeled data is available?
In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Transfer Sampling (TS), which combines uncertainty sampling and transfer learning techniques to sample only those unlabelled instances needed for finetuning of the pre-trained language models, leading to substantial reductions in the number of labels required for training. TS achieves this by identifying informative instances based on their relevance to all tasks involved in the MTL setup. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of our method across several popular NLP tasks and show that it outperforms standard MTL methods while reducing the total labeling cost by up to three times. Finally, we explore the reasons behind the poor generalization ability of existing multi-task learning methods and provide guidelines for designing more robust MTL systems that leverage transfer learning effectively. Our findings shed new light on the interplay between transfer learning and MTL and suggest directions for future research.

## 3.1 什么是Multi-task learning？
Multi-task learning (MTL) refers to the process of training a single deep neural network on multiple related tasks with shared parameters. Here, a "related" task means two or more tasks whose inputs or outputs are relevant to each other. For example, in natural language processing (NLP), one might want to classify texts into different categories such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and topic classification. Each of these tasks requires its own set of input features, so it makes sense to jointly optimize them through shared weights. This framework enables us to achieve better overall performance than if we were to independently develop models for each task separately. 

## 3.2 什么是Feature Extraction、Knowledge Distillation、Transfer Learning？
Feature extraction, knowledge distillation, and transfer learning are three common techniques used in MTL for incorporating external knowledge sources into models.

### Feature extraction
The simplest form of MTL involves extracting shared features from both tasks' input data sets and then training separate classifiers on top of these features. A popular approach is to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification tasks, for instance. Another way to extract features is to use pre-trained language models such as BERT or GPT-2, which already encode information about the underlying structure and semantics of language. These models can be fine-tuned on specific tasks without any need for dedicated supervision. The resulting representations can be fed directly into classifiers trained on top of them.

### Knowledge Distillation
Knowledge distillation is another approach that can be used to combine the outputs of multiple networks into a single output layer. One possible application is to improve the softmax probabilities predicted by a student model by assigning higher weights to correct predictions made by the teacher model. This type of knowledge transfer can be especially helpful when dealing with complex models or difficult tasks that are prone to overfitting.

### Transfer Learning
Transfer learning is a more advanced form of MTL that focuses on transferring learned representations from one task to another, typically after finetuning a pre-trained language model on additional tasks. While similar to feature extraction, transfer learning aims to leverage domain expertise learned in previous tasks and apply it to new ones. Moreover, transfer learning works well even when the source dataset contains very few or no labeled examples, since it uses unlabeled instances from other tasks to boost the performance of the model.

## 3.3 为什么需要Transfer Sampling？
Most existing multi-task learning algorithms require extensive amounts of labeled data for each task, making it challenging to adapt models for new tasks with limited labeled data. Transfer Sampling (TS) is an efficient and effective technique that allows us to efficiently utilize unlabeled data from other tasks to minimize the number of labels required for training a pre-trained language model, while retaining high accuracy levels. 

One potential drawback of existing MTL methods is that they often rely too heavily on global features extracted from a single representation space, neglecting the rich individual differences among tasks. If certain tasks require more specialized features, these methods will tend to perform poorly on those tasks due to lack of attention paid to them. Transfer Sampling addresses this issue by introducing local explanations that highlight the most important parts of the input data for each task, thus enabling us to focus on the right parts of the input data for each task. Specifically, TS identifies informative instances based on their relevance to all tasks involved in the MTL setup, thus ensuring that samples are representative of all tasks rather than just a single one. 

Furthermore, TS does not assume that the distributions of labeled and unlabeled data match across tasks. Instead, it adapts its sampling strategy dynamically based on the current progress of the model's training, allowing it to gradually transition from taking only unlabeled samples to using partially labeled data. This dynamic control mechanism ensures that the model trains quickly enough to make accurate predictions without being stuck in a local minimum and yet produces competitive results under limited labeled data. Lastly, TS avoids selecting dominant classes as much as possible, instead prioritizing samples that are likely to benefit all tasks equally.

# 4.实验验证
We evaluate TS on six popular NLP tasks - named entity recognition (NER), part-of-speech tagging (POS), dependency parsing, sentence classification, semantic role labeling (SRL), and natural language inference (NLI). We compare TS with standard MTL variants like co-training, MAML, and iterative learning. To ensure fair comparisons, we use identical hyperparameters across all experiments and limit each model's capacity to avoid excessive memory usage.

For each task, we randomly split the Wikipedia biography corpus into a training set of 90% and a test set of 10%. We preprocess each document by converting it to lowercase, removing punctuation marks, and splitting it into sentences. Then, we tokenize the sentences and assign a unique index to each token in the vocabulary. All words in the training set are replaced by their respective indices, and masked tokens are denoted by special symbols in the input sequences. Similarly, we generate maskings for each task according to the distribution of tokens assigned to each class. For POS and SRL, we consider the first n tokens as predictors for the next token, where n depends on the length of the sequence. We evaluate each model's accuracy and F1 score on the corresponding test set after performing fine-tuning with TS.

To measure the effectiveness of TS, we record the average change in the proportion of correctly labeled samples throughout training, as measured by the mean squared error between the predicted proportions of labeled and unlabeled samples. We also calculate metrics such as labeling time and diversity gain as described below.

## 4.1 Co-Training
Co-training is a traditional MTL method that applies a meta-learning algorithm to select pseudo-labels for unlabeled instances and update the weight vectors accordingly. We implement a version of co-training called "multi-task VAE", which extends VAE with an additional encoder head to produce task-specific pseudo-labels. 

First, we initialize a shared VAE decoder, which takes an input sequence and reconstructs it with a fixed-size latent space. We then construct separate encoders for each task, which map the input sequence to the shared latent space. During training, we alternate between updating the decoders and the encoders, feeding in newly generated pseudo-labels from the decoder to the associated encoders. We freeze the encoders during evaluation to prevent any accidental gradients flowing back to the decoders. We repeat this process until convergence or a maximum number of iterations.

## 4.2 MAML
MAML is an optimization algorithm that updates the model parameters of a black-box function approximator using gradient descent steps on small batches of labeled data. We extend MAML to handle MTL by alternating between updating the parameter vectors of the shared functions and the task-specific functions, while using a modified objective function that includes a regularizer term that encourages the difference between the learned functions and the actual task-specific functions. Unlike traditional MTL algorithms that optimize a shared loss function across all tasks, our approach optimizes separate loss functions for each task and relies on the regularization term to align the learned functions with the target task-specific functions.

## 4.3 Iterative Learning
Iterative learning consists of applying a pre-defined set of transformations to transform the input data, either sequentially or in parallel, before passing it to a downstream classifier. We use a variant of this method called online transfer learning, where we incrementally build a linear transformation pipeline by adding one transformer at a time, starting with identity mappings. We evaluate the quality of the learned pipelines on held-out data sets for each task, using cross-validation to estimate the performance of each step. We select the best performing pipeline for each task and subsequently use it to predict on unseen data. Since each transformer represents a particular aspect of the input data, the final prediction is obtained by combining the transformed input features with the predictions of the base estimator.
