# 1.简介
  

Domain-driven design (DDD) is a software development approach that aims at helping developers and domain experts communicate their ideas better by breaking down complex systems into smaller, more manageable components called domains. DDD helps teams collaborate on the business logic of an application, resulting in higher quality code and reduced costs. It also encourages writing clean, readable, maintainable, and extensible code as it promotes communication between different parts of the system and facilitates changes over time. 

This article focuses on conceptually modeling a domain using various UML diagrams and notation standards such as Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), Value Object Diagram (VOD), Class/Object Diagrams (C/O diagram), and Activity Diagrams. We will be explaining these diagrams along with basic terminologies related to them. In the second part of this series, we will explore how to implement the domain model using object-oriented programming languages like Java or C#. 

By the end of this tutorial series, you should have a deeper understanding of concepts, tools, techniques, and best practices for developing enterprise-level applications using DDD principles.

# 2.Basic Terminology
Before diving deep into DDD concepts, let's go through some basic terminology associated with ERD, VOD, C/O diagram, and activity diagram. This section assumes readers are familiar with OOP and data structures.
## 2.1 Entities
An entity represents any tangible thing that has identity and state. For example, in an e-commerce application, entities could include customers, products, orders, etc. Each instance of an entity can be uniquely identified by its primary key which is usually an identifier such as an integer, string, or GUID. The attributes of an entity represent its properties or characteristics. An attribute may store simple values like a name or email address, or it may hold references to other entities that have relationships with the current entity.

Entities are represented in entity relationship diagrams by ellipses or circles with arrows pointing from one entity to another if they have a one-to-many or many-to-one relationship. They typically have names written above them.

## 2.2 Attributes
Attributes are descriptions of things that make up the state of an entity. Examples of attributes might include customer details like name, age, phone number, or product characteristics like color, weight, price.

In entity relationship diagrams, attributes are represented as fields inside rectangles next to the entity ellipse. Attribute types are indicated by the type of the field within the rectangle.

## 2.3 Associations
Associations are relationships between two entities where there exists some kind of connection between them. The simplest form of association is a one-to-one relationship, where each entity instance relates to only one other entity instance. Other common associations include one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many, and composition.

In entity relationship diagrams, associations are represented by lines connecting pairs of entities together with cardinality indicators indicating how many instances of each entity participate in the relationship.

## 2.4 Aggregates and Composites
Aggregates and composites are both high-level architectural patterns that group multiple objects together and treat them as a single unit. Unlike aggregates, which exclusively own child objects, composites allow children to exist outside their parent aggregate boundaries. A composite can encapsulate multiple individual objects but still retain control over their lifetimes and behaviors.

The distinction between aggregrates and composites depends largely on the ownership structure and interactions between the grouped objects.

In entity relationship diagrams, aggregates are shown with rounded corners around the border while composites are shown without rounded corners.

## 2.5 Value Objects
Value objects represent immutable, meaningful pieces of information that don't need to be persisted. Examples of value objects might include datetimes, money amounts, and physical addresses.

Unlike entities, value objects do not have identities and cannot have independent existence apart from their owning entity. Value objects are always considered separate from other objects because they have no intrinsic identity and cannot stand alone.

In entity relationship diagrams, value objects are shown with dotted borders behind the corresponding entity ellipse.

## 2.6 Repositories
Repositories provide access to persistent storage mechanisms and act as a layer of abstraction between the domain models and data sources. They enable retrieving, storing, and updating domain objects and managing transactions across multiple data stores. Common repository patterns include DAO (Data Access Object), ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), and Unit of Work.

In entity relationship diagrams, repositories are shown as boxes with database symbols inside them.

## 2.7 Service Layers
Service layers provide additional functionality beyond what can be achieved solely in the domain models. These layers offer a way to decouple domain logic from infrastructure concerns and ensure modularity and reusability. Services can interact with repositories, manipulate domain objects, and perform cross-cutting concerns such as security, caching, and validation.

Services are commonly implemented using service locators and dependency injection frameworks.

In entity relationship diagrams, services are shown below the entities and above the adapters.

## 2.8 Adapters
Adapters translate data formats used by external systems or users to or from those used by internal systems. They handle differences in APIs, protocols, and data representations so that domain models can remain unaware of the specific requirements of external systems. They are designed to simplify integration with external systems while maintaining cohesion amongst domain models.

In entity relationship diagrams, adapters are shown below the services and above the views.

## 2.9 Views
Views present data in a format that is useful for users and stakeholders. They provide a level of separation between presentation and domain models and isolate user interface concerns from the rest of the application. Views often use presentation frameworks such as Angular or ReactJS to simplify coding and improve maintainability.

In entity relationship diagrams, views are shown below the adapters and above the controllers.

## 2.10 Controllers
Controllers receive incoming requests from clients, validate input, transform data if necessary, pass commands to the appropriate services, and return responses back to the client. Controllers are responsible for handling user actions, such as submitting forms or clicking buttons.

In entity relationship diagrams, controllers are shown below the views and above the infrastructure.

## 2.11 Infrastructure
Infrastructure layers contain modules that support the core functionalities of the application, including logging, error handling, performance monitoring, and transaction management. Infrastructure includes technologies such as databases, message brokers, and caches.

In entity relationship diagrams, infrastructure is shown below the controllers.
