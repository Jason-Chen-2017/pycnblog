# 2.基础概念及术语说明
Before jumping into explaining the core principles and techniques involved in achieving productivity improvement during day-to-day work tasks, let us understand some basic concepts related to TMS, PPTs/Rituals, and PBT.

1.Task Management System(TMS):
A Task management system is used to keep track of all the tasks assigned to individuals or teams. The goal of any task management system is to help users organize their work activities and achieve optimal productivity levels. Some popular TMS solutions include Asana, Microsoft Project, Jira, and Trello. It is important to use one that best suits your needs and preferences.

2.Productivity Hacks: 
Productivity hacks refer to small tweaks or tricks which can enhance user productivity significantly without changing the underlying logic or structure of the application. There are many productivity hacks available online which can be easily incorporated into your routine work routines to further enhance your productivity. A few examples of productivity hacks include custom keyboard shortcuts, notification reminders, and smart search filters. These can greatly reduce your workload and improve your overall productivity level.

3.Techniques for Prioritization and Tracking Tasks Effectively:
Prioritization is the process of arranging tasks based on importance, urgency, complexity, effort, and time constraints. Prioritization helps to assign critical tasks first while allowing for other lower priority tasks to wait until higher priority ones have been completed. In order to ensure that everything gets done, it is essential to regularly review your prioritized list and update it accordingly. For example, you can set aside specific times in your calendar each week to check your priorities and updates. This way, you won't forget anything or fall behind on any tasks.

4.Strategies for Learning New Skills and Techniques:
One of the key challenges facing programmers is becoming proficient in a wide range of programming languages, frameworks, libraries, tools, and technologies. Efficient learning processes enable developers to pick up new skills quickly and implement them successfully within their skillset. Here are three recommended strategies for learning new skills: 

1. Consistent Practice: Developers should practice regularly to build up expertise and knowledge. Repetitive practice not only improves your problem solving skills but also prepares you for crucial interviews. 

2. Interactive Courses and Training Sessions: Online courses like Udemy, Pluralsight, and edX offer free and affordable training resources. You can sign up for a course that interests you and attend live sessions where you receive tailored instruction from experts. 

3. Blogs and Community Support: Mentoring and support networks such as communities, forums, and blogs provide opportunities to discuss and learn from others who have gone before. Joining active discussions and sharing your experiences can help you identify areas for improvement.

5. Continuous Improvement Programs: It is essential to continuously monitor yourself and evaluate your progress towards becoming a successful developer. This includes reviewing your skills, making self-evaluations, and identifying strengths and weaknesses. Regular feedback loops help you develop healthy habits that foster self-development.

6. Competency Evaluation and Peer Feedback: During your job search, it is crucial to conduct regular evaluations of your skills and abilities to determine if they meet the requirements of the position being applied for. Additionally, frequent peer feedback can help you identify areas for improvement and gain valuable insights from experienced engineers.
