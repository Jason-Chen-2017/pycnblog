# 1.简介
  

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have achieved impressive results in several domains like robotics and Atari games. However, they typically require continuous action spaces and are often computationally expensive to train. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient), which can be trained on discrete action space problems with only minor changes to the existing DQN algorithm. 

DDPG is an off-policy actor-critic method that uses deep neural networks to learn policies directly from high-dimensional observations of the environment. It achieves great success on challenging tasks including navigation, manipulation, and locomotion using physics simulation environments such as MuJoCo. DDPG outperforms other DRL methods on these tasks by significantly reducing the variance of their returns, improving sample efficiency, and enabling them to handle large action spaces. 

In this work, we present DDPG and provide an implementation of it using PyTorch library. The code is available at https://github.com/cassidylaidlaw/ddpg-discrete. We also discuss some potential advantages of DDPG over other similar approaches and summarize its strengths and weaknesses compared to existing DRL algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate its application to various control tasks like swimming and catching fruit in open-ended environments.

Deep Q-Networks (DQN) [1] was introduced in 2013 by DeepMind and shown significant performance improvement over prior approaches in Atari games. Its key idea is to use a deep neural network to approximate the value function, and then use an actor-critic approach to find the optimal policy.

Another popular DRL algorithm called Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [2] has been widely used due to its stability and effectiveness in continuous action spaces. PPO leverages trust regions and adaptive penalty coefficients to guarantee convergence while keeping the number of updates per training iteration reasonable. Another recent algorithm called Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) [3] improves upon PPO by introducing entropy regularization and automatic temperature parameter tuning.

However, both PPO and SAC assume continuous actions, making them unsuitable for discrete action spaces. On the other hand, DDPG does not make any assumptions about the action distribution and can operate effectively even when the action space is discretized into a small set of values. Therefore, DDPG offers a unique balance between expressivity and tractability.

# 4.Background Introduction
In reinforcement learning (RL), an agent interacts with an environment through trial-and-error interactions. At each time step t, the agent receives observation x_t from the environment, selects an action a_t, and receives feedback r_t. Based on the received feedback, the agent learns what action should be taken next so as to maximize long-term reward. This process continues until the goal or end condition is reached. RL algorithms involve optimizing parameters of the agent’s behavior to achieve better performance. Two broad classes of RL algorithms exist: model-based and model-free. Model-based algorithms estimate the underlying MDP model before running experiments, whereas model-free algorithms rely on samples collected during training to derive insights. Despite their different types, most RL algorithms share two fundamental ideas: temporal difference learning and dynamic programming. Temporal difference learning involves updating estimates based on incremental errors computed during previous steps, whereas dynamic programming assumes optimality and constructs state representations that optimize expected rewards. In practice, many complex RL problems such as game playing, robotics, and control theory fall under either class depending on the context and desired tradeoff between accuracy and computational efficiency.    

# Continuous Action Space vs Discrete Action Space  
Continuous action spaces represent real numbers within a range, which allows for varying degrees of freedom for the agent to take actions. For example, a steering angle in a car can vary from -1 to +1 radians, allowing the agent to turn left or right. In contrast, discrete action spaces represent a fixed set of possible actions chosen from a finite list. For instance, in the classic Atari video game, there are only three valid actions: move up, move down, or stay still.   

Most contemporary RL algorithms assume continuous action spaces because they allow for greater flexibility than discrete ones. However, in certain cases where the action space is highly structured and limited, discrete action spaces may perform better. For example, consider the task of swimming in a fluid environment where movement along one dimension is constrained and vertical movements are allowed only at specific intervals. A conventional continuous action space would require the agent to output multiple dimensions representing all possible actions (i.e., acceleration, turning rate). In contrast, a discrete action space could limit the agent to moving forward, backward, or stopping vertically, resulting in faster and more efficient learning.   

Recently, several works have focused on developing RL algorithms that can work well on continuous action spaces, but may struggle in the case of discrete action spaces. One promising direction is to modify traditional RL algorithms like DQN, TRPO, and PPO to support discrete action spaces. However, few works have attempted to combine the best features of both continuous and discrete action spaces to develop a single algorithm that performs well across both settings.   

# Deep Deterministic Policies for Discrete Action Spaces   
In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients), which addresses the problem of leveraging deep neural networks to learn policies for discrete action spaces without resorting to approximating the continuous action space. DDPG provides significant improvements over earlier methods on challenging control tasks such as swimming and catching fruit. Here, we provide an overview of DDPG and highlight its core components and modifications made to the original DQN algorithm. 

## Components of DDPG
DDPG is an off-policy actor-critic method that uses deep neural networks to learn policies directly from high-dimensional observations of the environment. It consists of four main components:

1. **Actor**: An AI that takes an input observation x and outputs an action a. The actor aims to map observations to actions in a stochastic way, ensuring that the actions generated by it reflect the preferences of the agent. The actor learns the optimal policy by maximizing the agent’s cumulative discounted reward over a trajectory sampled from a behavior policy π(a|s).  

2. **Critic**: A function that estimates the value function Q(s, a). The critic evaluates the goodness of an action given an observation, helping the actor in selecting the right actions. The critic learns to predict the q-values for the transitions observed in the environment, which serve as inputs to the actor for generating the corresponding actions. Critic is learned using a regression error loss function that measures the distance between predicted and actual q-value.


3. **Replay Buffer**: Stores tuples (s, a, r, s') experienced by the agent interacting with the environment. Experience replay enables the agent to learn from past experiences rather than trying to memorize the entire sequence of experience leading up to the current moment. 

4. **Noise Process**: Adds randomness to the action selection process to explore new behaviors and prevent the agent from getting stuck in local minima. A variety of techniques can be employed to add noise to the action selection process, such as adding Gaussian white noise, epsilon greedy strategy, OU noise, etc. 


## Modifications to DQN
One major modification made to the original DQN algorithm is replacing the one-hot encoded representation of the action with the argmax of the Q-function output, which reduces the dimensionality of the action space and makes it easier to interpret the selected actions. Secondly, we add additional layers to the Neural Network architecture and increase the size of the hidden layer to address the curse of dimensionality inherent to the discrete action space. Additionally, we include batch normalization layers after every fully connected layer to improve the stability and speedup the learning process. We also use Adam optimizer instead of vanilla SGD to ensure stable learning rates. Overall, these modifications help the algorithm adapt quickly to new environments and configurations.
