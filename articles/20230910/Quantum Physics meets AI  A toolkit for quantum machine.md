Quantum computing has been attracting increasing attention from both academia and industry since the advent of quantum computers. Its applications in finance, healthcare, security, energy efficiency, and transportation are only limited by its scalability, speed, and accuracy. However, these benefits come with significant challenges: how to leverage quantum computations to improve traditional machine learning algorithms? In this article, we present QMLKit (pronounced as "Q-mark"), an open-source Python library that offers various tools and techniques for integrating quantum computing into existing machine learning models. We discuss some key features and methods of our toolbox along with relevant examples and tutorials. The goal is to help users understand the potential of quantum computing and apply it effectively to their real-world problems while still keeping up with emerging technologies such as deep neural networks.

# 2. Quantum Mechanics and Algorithms
In classical physics, quantum mechanics can be thought of as consisting of two parts: quantization and interactions between particles and fields. The former is responsible for reducing the uncertainty principle, allowing us to measure systems at higher precision than what could be achieved in classical space and time. By doing so, we gain information about the behavior of physical processes or phenomena, which are otherwise impossible to observe directly due to measurement limitations. Quantum mechanics provides a powerful platform on which to build more complex simulations of nature, including atoms and molecules, liquids and solids, clouds of particles, and even entire galaxies or nuclear reactors.

In contrast, quantum computing relies solely on quantum effects. It uses quantum gates or circuits composed of elementary operations like rotation around axes, phase shifts, and entanglements, to manipulate qubits or bits. These operations allow us to simulate highly complex quantum systems at scale, enabling many interesting computational tasks, ranging from cryptography and finance to biology and medicine. While quantum computing may appear promising, it also faces several practical issues. For one, simulating arbitrary quantum systems at microscopic scales requires advanced control hardware and colossal amounts of computation power. This places severe restrictions on the size and complexity of quantum algorithms that can be implemented using current technology. Additionally, there is a lack of standardized terminology and notation across different research communities, making it difficult to communicate ideas effectively and efficiently. Therefore, much progress towards realizing quantum advantage remains elusive.

To bridge the gap between classical and quantum computing, machine learning relies heavily on statistical techniques and probabilistic concepts, which have become essential in a wide range of applications. Many modern machine learning algorithms use mathematical optimization techniques such as gradient descent to find the parameters that minimize a loss function based on the training data. One way to make these algorithms more robust is to incorporate prior assumptions regarding the underlying probability distribution over input variables. This process is called Bayesian inference, where we estimate the likelihood of different hypotheses given the available data, and then choose the most likely hypothesis as the best explanation for new observations.

Recently, a new approach called hybrid quantum-classical algorithms has emerged that combines quantum circuit simulation and classical optimization techniques to optimize a model's performance. These algorithms often outperform classical algorithms in terms of accuracy but require exponentially fewer evaluations of the objective function compared to full quantum simulation. Overall, quantum computing and machine learning provide complimentary strengths and opportunities to advance fundamental research directions in areas such as artificial intelligence, computer science, chemistry, electronics, medicine, and engineering. Together, they offer unprecedented possibilities for revolutionizing how humans interact with the world and transforming industries such as finance, healthcare, and energy industry.
