## 1.1 定义
Financial market sentiment refers to the opinion of people towards a particular stock or index on the day-to-day trading activities within its financial ecosystem and is usually influenced by news articles, social media platforms, news releases, analyst reports, industry events etc. It can be positive or negative depending upon how it is perceived by the public in general. Sentiment analysis of financial data can help investors make better decisions regarding their portfolio management as well as derive insights for investment strategies that will benefit from such analysis. There are several methods available for analyzing financial market sentiments which include: Rule based sentiment analysis, Machine learning techniques, and Deep Learning approaches. 

Sentiment Analysis involves extracting the opinions and attitudes expressed through various media channels to identify customer satisfaction levels, brand reputation, product preferences among others. It helps businesses understand customers’ concerns and emotions towards their products or services, leading them to take appropriate actions. Hence, with accurate detection of sentiment, organizations can improve their profitability, productivity, and revenue growth.

In this article, we will talk about one specific application of sentiment analysis in finance where we analyze the overall trend of the stock market in different time periods using natural language processing techniques like Bag-of-Words model along with Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier algorithm. We will also discuss the key challenges faced while implementing these techniques, as well as some potential solutions. Finally, we will conclude with an evaluation of our work and suggest ways forward to further improve our results. 


## 1.2 影响因素
The primary impact factor driving financial market sentiment over a period of time is not only dependent on the company's performance but also on factors such as political climate, economic conditions, regulatory policies and the interest rates associated with bond yields. The popularity of a stock may go up or down depending on numerous other factors such as company strategy, competitor strengths and weaknesses, global economic indicators, company earnings surprises, and various macroeconomic factors. Additionally, user behaviour on social media platforms could have significant influence on sentiment.

## 2.1 NLP(Natural Language Processing)
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to understand and interact with human language naturally. The main aim of NLP is to enable machines to process and analyze large volumes of unstructured textual data quickly and accurately to extract valuable insights that can be used for decision making purposes. Some common applications of NLP include sentiment analysis, chatbots, search engines, machine translation, and topic modeling. In order to achieve efficient and effective analysis of financial market sentiments, we need to first understand fundamental concepts of Natural Language Processing, particularly the concept of bag-of-words and SVM classifiers. Let us dive into each of these terms in detail.

### 2.1.1 Bag-of-words model
Bag-of-words model represents textual data as a collection of words without considering grammar, syntax or punctuation marks. Each document in the corpus is represented by a vector of word frequencies corresponding to all unique words across all documents. The vocabulary of unique words in the corpus forms the feature space, and the vector values represent frequency counts for each word in each document. A simple example would be: given three documents "I love apples", "I hate oranges" and "Peter loves pineapples too", the bag-of-words representation of these sentences would look something like this:

Document 1: [1,0,0,1]
Document 2: [0,1,1,0]
Document 3: [1,0,1,1]

where the rows correspond to the documents and the columns correspond to the words in the vocabulary.

Once we convert the textual data into vectors of word frequencies, we can use machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify them into different categories or clusters. An SVM classifier takes input data points as vectors and tries to find a hyperplane that separates the two classes best. For example, if we want to separate the documents into two groups, we can train an SVM classifier to assign high scores to documents containing words related to food/restaurant during lunch hours and low scores otherwise. This way, we can obtain a binary classification of whether a certain event happened in a particular hour of the day or not. 

Using the above approach, we can build a sentiment analyzer for financial market data that classifies tweets and news headlines into positive, negative or neutral based on the content present in them. 


## 2.2 Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is a computational technique for identifying and understanding the underlying emotional tone of texts, regardless of source. It has been applied to various domains including customer feedback, social media monitoring, and healthcare. Sentiment analysis involves applying natural language processing techniques to raw text data to determine the attitude of the speaker or author towards a subject matter. Various models have been proposed to measure the degree of positiveness or negativeness in a sentence, taking into account lexicons, part-of-speech tags, and dependency trees. However, few works have focused solely on financial market sentiment analysis. 

Therefore, the objective of this project is to develop a sentiment analysis tool for the daily discussions surrounding stock prices. To do so, we will follow the below steps:

1. Collect historical data: We will collect daily quotes for popular stocks from Yahoo Finance API and store it locally for later usage.
2. Preprocess Data: Cleaning the collected data and preprocessing it to remove any noise or irrelevant information. 
3. Feature Extraction: Extracting relevant features from preprocessed data like closing price, volume, moving average, percentage change etc. 
4. Applying SVM Classifier: Training a support vector machine classifier on extracted features to predict the sentiment of the stock movement.  
5. Evaluation and Validation: Evaluating the accuracy of the trained classifier on test dataset and tuning parameters accordingly to improve its efficiency. 
6. Deployment: Deploying the sentiment analysis tool for future usage on live stock price updates.
