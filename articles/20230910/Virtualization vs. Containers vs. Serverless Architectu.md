# 2.概述
Virtualization refers to a process of creating a virtual version of a computer system so it runs as if it were a physical one. It involves separating hardware resources like CPU memory storage and network connectivity into layers, known as virtualized hardware. The operating system running inside the virtual machine then operates independently within its virtual environment. Virtualization offers several benefits, including resource sharing across multiple users and improving efficiency, but also creates new challenges. For example, virtualization may require specialized software stacks, different hypervisor configurations, and increased overhead due to emulation. 

On the other hand, containers are lightweight virtualization environments designed specifically to package and run applications together with all necessary dependencies. They differ from traditional virtualization techniques because they do not create separate virtual machines, instead, containers share underlying host systems’ kernel and file system with other containers. By using containers, developers can build more complex application architectures that include microservices and cloud-native applications without having to manage many individual virtual machines manually. However, containers have their own set of benefits, such as easy deployment, fast boot times, smaller footprint, and isolated development environments. Additionally, containers offer greater flexibility than traditional virtualization techniques, making it easier to adjust service configurations based on changing needs and requirements.

Finally, serverless computing platforms enable developers to deploy highly available and scalable applications without managing servers or clusters. These platforms allow developers to write functions or scripts that respond to events triggered by various sources, such as HTTP requests, database updates, or message queues. Developers can pay only for the resources used during execution, eliminating concerns about capacity planning and manual scaling. Together, virtualization, containers, and serverless computing form a spectrum where no single technology is clearly superior over another. Understanding the key differences between these three technologies and choosing the right one for a particular project or scenario requires expertise in both computer science and business domains, as well as knowledge of relevant industry standards, best practices, and trends.

This article will focus on comparing virtualization, containers, and serverless computing technologies by analyzing their similarities and differences, defining terms and concepts, explaining core algorithms and operations, showing code examples, and presenting research directions for future work.

# 3.虚拟机与容器技术比较
## 3.1 定义、术语及概念
### 3.1.1 计算机系统的层次结构
A typical computer system has four main layers, typically denoted as physical hardware, device drivers, operating system, and user programs. Physical hardware consists of processors, memory modules, hard disks, and network cards. Device drivers translate hardware commands into instructions executable by the operating system. Operating system controls access to hardware devices and provides common services like input/output management, scheduling, memory management, and communication protocols. User programs interact with the system through APIs provided by the operating system, such as sockets and threads. A typical computer system architecture can be seen below:


In the above diagram, the black arrows represent data flow between the layers. Each layer can communicate directly with adjacent layers via direct memory access (DMA), bypassing the operating system completely. On the other hand, there exists additional inter-layer communication mechanisms, such as system calls, shared libraries, RPC (remote procedure call), and pipes, that facilitate communication between layers. 

### 3.1.2 虚拟化技术
Virtualization refers to a process of creating a virtual version of a computer system so it runs as if it were a physical one. It involves separating hardware resources like CPU memory storage and network connectivity into layers, known as virtualized hardware. The operating system running inside the virtual machine then operates independently within its virtual environment. As a result, the virtual machine appears to be a physical machine to the guest OS. Virtualization offers several benefits, including resource sharing across multiple users and improving efficiency, but also creates new challenges. For example, virtualization may require specialized software stacks, different hypervisor configurations, and increased overhead due to emulation.

In contrast to regular physical hardware, virtualized hardware has dedicated resources such as CPUs, RAM, and disk space. This means that there are fewer resources available for actual usage while the system is undergoing virtualization. Similarly, the guest operating system operates on a reduced subset of the total available hardware resources, resulting in decreased performance compared to non-virtualized systems. Virtualization works best when coupled with efficient I/O mechanisms, such as copy-on-write and zero-copy optimizations, that limit the amount of duplicated data and reduce the impact of virtual machine downtime.

### 3.1.3 容器技术
Containers are lightweight virtualization environments designed specifically to package and run applications together with all necessary dependencies. They differ from traditional virtualization techniques because they do not create separate virtual machines, instead, containers share underlying host systems’ kernel and file system with other containers. By using containers, developers can build more complex application architectures that include microservices and cloud-native applications without having to manage many individual virtual machines manually. However, containers have their own set of benefits, such as easy deployment, fast boot times, smaller footprint, and isolated development environments. Additionally, containers offer greater flexibility than traditional virtualization techniques, making it easier to adjust service configurations based on changing needs and requirements.

To isolate the application environment, Docker engine uses namespaces, cgroups, and chroot jails to simulate independent Linux processes with their own unique filesystem, network interfaces, and PID namespace. All containers share a single instance of the Docker daemon, which manages the containers' creation, startup, and shutdown lifecycle. Besides isolation, Docker also supports port mapping and volume mounting capabilities, allowing containers to interact with the outside world and exchange data easily. Overall, containers simplify building, testing, and shipping software by abstracting away environmental details, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of infrastructure changes.

### 3.1.4 无服务器计算（Serverless）
Serverless Computing enables developers to deploy highly available and scalable applications without managing servers or clusters. These platforms allow developers to write functions or scripts that respond to events triggered by various sources, such as HTTP requests, database updates, or message queues. Developers can configure serverless functions to execute automatically in response to predefined triggers or in response to external events, reducing the need for manual operation. Functions are executed on demand, auto-scaling, and billed based on the number of executions performed, minimizing costs and maximizing productivity. 

AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, and IBM OpenWhisk are popular serverless compute options that enable developers to write function code in various programming languages and deploy them securely to the platform's managed runtime environment. AWS Step Functions, Amazon States Language, and Apache Oozie are workflow automation tools that combine multiple functions into larger workflows and automate complex sequential and parallel processing logic.

Overall, serverless computing is a powerful way to build distributed and scalable applications quickly without worrying about managing the underlying infrastructure. Its flexible architecture makes it ideal for rapid iteration, agile delivery, and event-driven applications. However, serverless computing faces significant tradeoffs, such as slower start time, higher latency, and increased operational complexity compared to traditional IT infrastructure.

### 3.1.5 操作系统级别虚拟化（OS-level virtualization）
OS-level virtualization refers to the technique of creating a virtualized environment by running guest operating systems on top of existing host operating systems. Unlike traditional virtualization, OS-level virtualization allows running multiple operating systems on a single computer simultaneously. Examples of OS-level virtualization technologies include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Oracle VirtualBox, Parallels Desktop, and QEMU.

The primary advantage of OS-level virtualization lies in better integration with native hardware and legacy software. Developers can use pre-installed virtual machines containing multiple operating systems and third-party applications without requiring any installation or configuration steps. This greatly simplifies migration efforts, enabling organizations to consolidate and standardize their IT environments. However, OS-level virtualization comes with its own set of drawbacks, including compatibility issues, lack of flexibility, and reduced control over guest systems. Additionally, modern desktop operating systems already incorporate support for virtualization, making it unnecessary to rely solely on OS-level virtualization. Therefore, OS-level virtualization is mainly used in enterprise environments where backward compatibility is a critical factor.

# 3.2 特征分析及对比
We now define some features and principles that distinguish virtualization, containers, and serverless computing technologies. We will analyze these characteristics to identify similarities and differences among these technologies, as well as determine whether one technology meets the needs of a given project or use case.  

## 3.2.1 硬件分离
All virtualization technologies involve hardware separation. Virtual machines and containers are two popular types of virtualization solutions that utilize separate hardware components like CPUs, RAM, and disk space, respectively. Virtual machines also offer enhanced performance compared to ordinary hosts due to improved resource allocation and optimized I/O paths. Despite the added level of abstraction, however, virtual machines still rely heavily on the same basic hardware constructs as physical hardware, resulting in a lower degree of isolation from the underlying host system.

Containers offer even more fine-grained hardware separation by utilizing kernel namespaces and cgroups to provide isolated processes and limited access to system resources. Containers offer faster launch times, smaller memory usage, and simpler deployment compared to virtual machines. However, unlike virtual machines, containers cannot fully replicate the complete state of a host system, limiting their utility in production environments. Moreover, containers lack built-in networking functionality and depend on external networks for accessing external services. Lastly, although containers offer high portability, migrating existing applications to containers may require considerable effort and testing.

In summary, virtualization and containers rely on hardware separation to achieve resource sharing, improved performance, and simplified administration tasks. Both technologies are widely applicable to diverse use cases, ranging from web servers, devops pipelines, and IoT edge devices to big data analytics, blockchain, and microservice architectures. Choosing the appropriate technology depends on the project's requirements, budget, and expected performance outcomes.

## 3.2.2 可移植性
Another important feature of virtualization and containers is their ability to be portable across different platforms. Unlike traditional virtualization methods, containers are entirely self-contained, meaning they can be moved between different clouds, bare metal servers, and virtual machines without losing their functional properties. This makes containers very attractive for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, small and medium-sized businesses, and large enterprises seeking to reduce risk and costs. Container images can also be stored in remote repositories for distribution, easing management and versioning challenges.

However, since containers are generally tied to a single operating system, they are often less efficient compared to VMs on platforms with competing hypervisors. For instance, Docker runs best on recent versions of Linux kernels, whereas Windows Server Core does not natively support containers yet. Also, certain container runtime implementations may be slower and less stable on Windows Server Core. Nevertheless, containers offer great potential for horizontal scalability and continuous deployment patterns that address complex multi-tier architectures, supporting polyglot persistence models, and integrating with modern orchestration frameworks. Overall, virtually every organization that aims to increase developer velocity and agility will find containerization an essential component of their toolbox.

## 3.2.3 弹性伸缩
Since virtualization technologies operate at a low level of abstraction, they can scale horizontally simply by adding more instances of the same virtual machine onto a cluster. This makes it particularly useful for big data analytics, AI, and cloud-native applications that require vertical scaling of compute power and storage, while still benefitting from horizontal scaling opportunities.

Containers, on the other hand, come with their own methodology for scaling horizontally called Kubernetes. Kubernetes automates the provisioning and management of container clusters, allowing developers to spin up new pods or remove old ones based on workload requirements, thus optimizing resource utilization and reducing waste. Since containers share resources with other containers on the same node, Kubernetes can efficiently allocate resources across multiple nodes according to pod placement constraints.

Additionally, serverless platforms like AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions offer elasticity of compute power, autoscaling, and pricing plans based on consumed resources. Using serverless functions frees up staff from dealing with the overhead of managing servers and saves costs, while still being able to respond to sudden traffic spikes or user demand. Overall, serverless computing and containers offer complementary capabilities for scaling horizontally, depending on the desired scope of parallelization.

## 3.2.4 透明性
Both virtualization and containers offer transparent operation to the end-user. Users can create and modify virtual machines or containers without needing to know anything about the underlying implementation details. By leveraging these abstractions, administrators can manage the entire infrastructure as a single unit rather than thousands of individual machines. This makes it much easier to maintain consistency and reduces errors associated with configuring virtual machines manually.

Furthermore, container engines like Docker provide a simple command line interface that allows users to perform numerous actions like starting and stopping containers, inspecting logs, monitoring metrics, and deploying containers to different environments. This makes it easier for developers to get started with containers and familiar with their inner workings. Thus, containerization is becoming increasingly accessible to all levels of technical proficiency, whether a sysadmin, developer, or operations engineer.

## 3.2.5 安全性
Virtualization and containers offer strong security protection against attacks and threats. Traditional virtual machines offer complete root access to the host system, which poses a serious security risk if misused. Containers, on the other hand, are much more secure thanks to their minimalist design, automatic updates, and read-only file systems. With proper access controls, organizations can ensure that sensitive information remains protected in containers and prevent malicious activities such as intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS).

In addition, containers offer the option to encrypt data at rest and in transit. While this protects confidential information from unauthorized access, it also introduces extra complexity and overhead for encryption and decryption operations, leading to performance bottlenecks. Moreover, virtualization technologies like VMware vSphere can offer advanced security policies like encryption at rest, but this requires purchasing expensive licenses and managing a dedicated security team. Overall, careful selection of virtualization and container technologies, along with security policies and procedures, can significantly enhance the overall security posture of an organization.

## 3.2.6 网络隔离
Containers offer limited networking isolation by default, relying on external networks for accessing external services and communicating with the outside world. Virtual machines, on the other hand, offer full networking isolation, providing their own virtual LAN (VLAN) and public IP addresses. While this provides enhanced security, it also imposes performance and scalability challenges for large-scale deployments. Further, virtual machines and containers cannot communicate directly without a VPN tunnel or by setting up a bridge between them, limiting the usefulness of traditional middleware and routing technologies.

## 3.2.7 资源利用率
Virtualization and containers provide distinct ways to optimize resource consumption. Virtual machines optimize resource utilization by allocating resources proportionally across different virtual machines. Containers, on the other hand, minimize the overhead of executing multiple instances of the same image by reusing their read-only file system and allocated resources. Although this improves efficiency, it may lead to resource wastage for applications that don't require this optimization.

Moreover, both technologies offer options for balancing resource allocation between different VMs and containers. For example, containers can reserve a portion of the host system's CPU cycles for themselves, while leaving the remaining capacity for other applications. This can dramatically reduce idle CPU cycles, resulting in significant savings. Additionally, virtualization technologies like VMware vSphere can distribute CPU, memory, and storage resources across multiple hosts and clusters, optimizing resource usage even beyond what would otherwise be possible with a traditional virtualization setup.

## 3.2.8 生命周期管理
Containerization simplifies infrastructure management by streamlining the deployment process and accelerating software development cycles. Administrators can use automated CI/CD tools to build container images, push them to registries, and roll out updates seamlessly across the fleet of virtual machines or containers. This eliminates the need for manual patching and rollbacks, reducing risk and mitigating downtime.

When paired with declarative configuration management tools like Ansible, Puppet, Chef, and Terraform, containerization can integrate seamlessly with the rest of an organization's DevOps ecosystem. Configuring containers can be treated just like any other piece of infrastructure, with automated approval workflows, change notifications, and audit trails.

Overall, virtualization and containers provide unique solutions for resource optimization, life cycle management, transparency, and security. Deciding which technology fits your needs and goals requires an understanding of the specific requirements and priorities of your project or company.
