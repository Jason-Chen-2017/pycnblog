The child with good peer relationships should:

- help the other children
- resolve conflict
- show interest in other children
- avoid conflict

### Explanation:

The instruction asks about the characteristics of a child with good peer relationships. The wording of the question asks for a list of characteristics. Because the question asks for a list, each item should be separated by a semicolon. The use of the semicolon in this instance signifies that the instruction asks for a list of items that complete the request.

The instructions ask for good relationships with peers, not relationships in general, so the response should be limited to positive peer relationships. This means that responses such as “disagree with other children” are not appropriate.

Another response, “find common ground,” is a characteristic that is closely related to the idea of showing interest in other children. Because the question asks for a list of characteristics, both of these responses should be used.

The instructions ask for characteristics of the child with good peer relationships. The question does not ask about how a child can develop good peer relationships. Therefore, the response “make friends” is not appropriate.
