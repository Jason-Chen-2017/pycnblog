## 3. 核心算法原理

### 3.1 分子表示学习

在将深度学习应用于化学领域之前,首先需要将分子这种典型的结构化数据转化为向量表示,以便输入神经网络模型。主要的分子表示方法有:

#### 3.1.1 基于手工特征的表示
最初的分子表示通常由人工提取的分子描述符(molecular descriptors)构成,例如结构指纹、电荷分布、SMILES等。这种方式存在以下缺陷:

1. 特征工程费时费力
2. 信息丢失,描述性能受限

#### 3.1.2 基于图卷积的表示
Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful framework to directly learn the representation of molecular graphs in an end-to-end manner. The key idea behind GNNs is to iteratively update the feature vector of each atom by recursively propagating and aggregating feature vectors of its neighborhood atoms. Various GNN architectures have been proposed for molecular representation learning, such as GG-NN, MPNN, DMPNN, GIN, etc. The learned representations can then be used as input features for downstream tasks like property prediction or generation.

A GNN-based molecular representation is typically obtained as follows:

1) Initialize atom-level feature vectors, e.g., using atom types and other attributes
2) Update each atom's feature vector by aggregating neighbors' feature vectors
3) Perform the above neighborhood aggregation for several iterations
4) Readout the final graph-level representation by combining all atom features

The neighborhood aggregation step is the core of GNNs, which can be formulated as:

$$h_v^{(k+1)} = \gamma \left( h_v^{(k)}, \ \square_{u\in \mathcal{N}(v)} \, \phi\left(h_v^{(k)}, h_u^{(k)}, e_{v,u}\right) \right)$$

Here, $h_v^{(k)}$ is the feature vector of atom $v$ at the $k$-th iteration. $\mathcal{N}(v)$ represents the neighbors of atom $v$ in the molecular graph. $\phi(\cdot)$ is a differentiable function, such as neural networks, that computes the updated neighborhood representation. $\square$ is a permutation-invariant function, e.g., sum, mean or maximum, that aggregates the neighboring representations. $\gamma(\cdot)$ is a nonlinear activation function like ReLU.

This neighborhood aggregation mimics the message passing scheme of belief propagation, allowing effective representation learning on arbitrary graph-structured data.

#### 3.1.3 基于注意力机制的表示学习
On top of the basic GNN framework, more advanced techniques have been developed to better capture long-range dependencies and global contexts, such as attentional mechanisms and higher-order graph convolutions.

The self-attention mechanism, popularized by the Transformer model, computes the weighted sum of features across all atoms, allowing any atom to attend to any other atom in the molecular graph. This is particularly powerful for modeling long-range interactions. The attention weights are dynamically computed based on the current atom representations:

$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$$

Where $Q, K, V$ are query, key and value projections of the atom features. $d_k$ is a scaling factor.

By incorporating self-attention layers into GNNs, models like MPAN and AttConvGNN can boost the predictive performance on various molecular property benchmarks.

### 3.2 分子性质预测

With molecular representations learned by GNNs or other methods, various downstream tasks like property prediction become accessible by training neural networks to map the input molecular representations to target properties.

#### 3.2.1 回归任务

For regression tasks like predicting quantitative properties (e.g. solubility, toxicity), a multi-layer feedforward neural network is typically used:

$$\hat{y} = \text{NN}(h_G) $$

Where $h_G$ is the learned molecular representation (e.g. graph-level output from a GNN), and $\hat{y}$ is the predicted property value.

To train the neural network, we minimize a regression loss like mean squared error between the predicted and ground truth property values over a training dataset:

$$\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \| \hat{y}_i - y_i \|_2^2$$

Where $N$ is the number of training samples, $\hat{y}_i$ and $y_i$ are the predicted and true property values respectively.

Popular models for this task include Graph Convolutional Models (Tsubaki et al., 2018) and DimeNet (Klicpera et al., 2020). By leveraging GNNs to learn molecular representations from scratch, these models achieve state-of-the-art performance on various molecular property prediction benchmarks.

#### 3.2.2 分类任务 

For classification tasks like predicting molecular activities or binding events, a similar architecture can be used by replacing the final output layer with a classification layer:

$$\hat{y} = \text{softmax}(W^T \text{NN}(h_G) + b)$$

Here $W$ and $b$ are learnable weights and biases of the output classification layer.

The training objective becomes minimizing the cross-entropy classification loss:

$$\mathcal{L} = - \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^C y_{i,j} \log \hat{y}_{i,j}$$

Where $C$ is the number of classes, $y_{i,j}$ is a binary indicator (0 or 1) whether the $i$-th sample belongs to class $j$, and $\hat{y}_{i,j}$ is the predicted probability for that class.

Examples of models based on this formulation include Directed Graph Convolutional Neural Network (Zhang et al., 2022) and AttConvGNN (Luo et al., 2022), which achieve impressive performance on tasks like molecular activity prediction and protein-ligand binding affinity prediction.

### 3.3 反应路径预测

Another important application of deep learning in chemistry is to predict and understand chemical reaction pathways and mechanisms. This is crucial for applications like synthesis planning, catalysis design, and mechanism discovery.

The key challenge is that reaction pathways involve a dynamically changing molecular graph, as bonds break and form during the reaction process. Recently, significant progress has been made by combining GNNs with neural message passing models inspired by classical simulations.

#### 3.3.1 Neural Message Passing Framework
The neural message passing framework aims to learn a continuous-depth message passing model, analogous to the discretized t-SNE method used in classical simulations.

At each virtual time step, atom representations are updated based on their current states and interatomic messages:

$$m_v^{(t+1)} = \sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}(v)} M_m^{(t)}(h_v^{(t)}, h_u^{(t)}, e_{v,u})$$
$$h_v^{(t+1)} = M_h^{(t)}(h_v^{(t)}, m_v^{(t+1)})$$

Where $m_v^{(t)}$ is the message vector passed to atom $v$, and $M_m^{(t)}, M_h^{(t)}$ are neural networks that dynamically update the messages and atom representations at each time step.

This message passing scheme is iterated over multiple time steps to simulate the full reaction trajectory.

Models based on this framework, like CNRGNN, ANI-Transformer and DynaGNN, demonstrate impressive capability in predicting reaction paths, barriers, and mechanisms for a variety of reaction types.

#### 3.3.2 Equivariant Graph Neural Networks

A key issue in reaction modeling is to ensure equivariance - the model's outputs should transform in the same way as the inputs under 3D rotations and permutations of atoms/bonds. This geometric invariance is essential for physical correctness.

Equivariant Graph Networks (EGNs) provide a elegant solution by encoding 3D geometric data (coordinates, distances, angles) using irreducible representations of 3D rotation and permutation groups. All neural network operations are designed to be equivariant to these symmetry transformations.

EGNs can learn highly accurate force fields and potential energies, enabling accurate reaction path simulations and mechanism analysis. Models like Dimenet, Gemini, and Segnn achieve unprecedented accuracy compared to classical force fields.

In summary, deep learning opens up new avenues for understanding chemical reactivity by capturing the full atomistic details in an accurate and efficient manner. This will be pivotal for future molecular discovery and design.

### 3.4 分子设计

Developing novel molecules with desirable properties is one of the holy grails of chemical research. Traditional methods like combinatorial chemistry and rational design are limited by the astronomically large chemical space.

Deep generative models provide a powerful data-driven approach to navigate this vast space by learning the underlying distribution of molecular structures and properties from data.

#### 3.4.1 SMILES Generation via RNNs/Transformers

One popular approach is to train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or Transformers to generate SMILES strings (a text-based linear representation of molecules). Character-by-character generation allows exploring the unbounded molecular space.

For example, an RNN can be trained using the negative log-likelihood loss:

$$\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{t=1}^{T_i} \log P(s_t^{(i)} | s_1^{(i)}, \dots, s_{t-1}^{(i)}; \theta)$$

Where $s_t^{(i)}$ is the $t$-th character in the $i$-th SMILES string, $T_i$ is the string length, and $P(\cdot)$ is the probability of generating that character given by the RNN parameterized by $\theta$.

However, SMILES generation models often produce a high proportion of invalid or unstable molecules. Reinforcement learning techniques like REINVENT and GuacaMol use validity/quality metrics as rewards to fine-tune toward optimized molecular libraries.

#### 3.4.2 Latent Space Generative Models

Another line of work uses variational autoencoders (VAEs) or generative adversarial networks (GANs) to learn a continuous latent representation of molecular space, where new molecules can be generated by decoding points in this latent space.

For example, a GNN-based VAE jointly learns an encoder $E_\phi(G)$ that maps molecular graphs $G$ to a latent code $z$, and a decoder $D_\theta(z)$ that reconstructs molecular graphs from latent codes.

The VAE objective combines reconstruction accuracy and latent distribution matching:

$$\mathcal{L}(\phi, \theta; G) = -\mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z|G)}[\log p_\theta(G|z)] + D_{KL}(q_\phi(z|G) \| p(z))$$  

Where $q_\phi(z|G)$ is the encoder's distribution and $p(z)$ is a prior like Gaussian. $p_\theta(G|z)$ is the likelihood of generating molecular graph $G$ from latent $z$ under the decoder.

Novel molecules can be generated by sampling $z$ from the prior $p(z)$ and running the decoder $D_\theta(z)$. Geometrically, the latent space can be optimized and navigated to generate molecules satisfying desirable constraints.

Prominent models in this category are JT-VAE, GraphAF and GraphEBM. They achieve state-of-the-art performance on various molecular property optimization benchmarks.

### 3.5 生成模型的评估与优化

Evaluating the quality of generated molecules is critical for guiding the optimization process. Key metrics include:

- Validity: Percentage of generated structures satisfying chemical valency rules
- Uniqueness: Fraction of non-duplicates compared to the training set 
- Novelty: Distribution statistics measuring departure from the training data
- Property optimization: Scores based on target properties like solubility, activity, etc.

For directed molecular optimization, techniques like Bayesian optimization, gradient ascent, reinforcement learning, and evolutionary strategies are commonly employed to guide the generative model toward the optimal molecular space.

A concrete example is the REINVENT framework which combines RNN-based SMILES generation with reinforcement fine-tuning and genetic algorithms to optimize toward desired molecular properties and automatically design
