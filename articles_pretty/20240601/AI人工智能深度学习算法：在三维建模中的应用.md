The softmax function is used for multi-class classification tasks. It maps a vector of real-valued inputs to a vector of probabilities, with the sum of the probabilities equal to 1. The softmax function is defined as:

$$
\\text{softmax}(x_i) = \\frac{e^{x_i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n} e^{x_j}}
$$

### 4.2 Loss Functions

Loss functions measure the difference between the model's predictions and the actual values, providing a signal for the model to adjust its weights during training. Common loss functions include the mean squared error (MSE) and the cross-entropy loss.

The MSE is used for regression tasks. It measures the average squared difference between the model's predictions and the actual values. The MSE is defined as:

$$
\\text{MSE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2
$$

#### 4.2.2 Cross-Entropy Loss

The cross-entropy loss is used for classification tasks. It measures the difference between the model's predicted probabilities and the actual labels. The cross-entropy loss is defined as:

$$
\\text{CE} = -\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i \\log(\\hat{y}_i)
$$
