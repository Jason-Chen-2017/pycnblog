## 1. Background Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), the development and fine-tuning of large models have become a cornerstone of progress. This article aims to guide readers through the process of creating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for MNIST classification from scratch. By the end of this article, readers will have a solid understanding of the principles, techniques, and tools involved in large model development and fine-tuning.

### 1.1 Importance of Large Models in AI

Large models play a crucial role in AI, enabling the creation of sophisticated systems capable of handling complex tasks. These models are essential for achieving state-of-the-art performance in various domains, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

### 1.2 MNIST Dataset: A Classic Benchmark

The MNIST dataset is a popular benchmark for evaluating the performance of image classification algorithms. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits, each of size 28x28 pixels. The dataset is widely used due to its simplicity and the ease with which it can be used to train and test models.

## 2. Core Concepts and Connections

### 2.1 Neural Networks: The Building Blocks of Large Models

Neural networks are the fundamental building blocks of large models. They are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process and transmit information.

### 2.2 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): A Special Type of Neural Network

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of neural network specifically designed for processing grid-like data, such as images. They are particularly effective for image classification tasks due to their ability to automatically learn and extract features from the input data.

### 2.3 Layers in CNNs: Understanding Their Role

CNNs consist of several layers, each with a specific role in the overall process. These layers include the convolutional layer, pooling layer, fully connected layer, and activation function.

### 2.4 Backpropagation: The Learning Algorithm for CNNs

Backpropagation is the primary learning algorithm used in CNNs. It is a supervised learning algorithm that adjusts the weights of the connections between neurons to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output.

## 3. Core Algorithm Principles and Specific Operational Steps

### 3.1 Designing the CNN Architecture

Designing the CNN architecture involves selecting the appropriate number and types of layers, as well as their configurations. This process requires a balance between model complexity and computational efficiency.

### 3.2 Initializing Weights and Biases

Before training the model, the weights and biases must be initialized. Common initialization methods include Xavier initialization, He initialization, and random initialization.

### 3.3 Forward Propagation

Forward propagation is the process of passing the input data through the CNN, computing the output of each layer, and ultimately obtaining the predicted output.

### 3.4 Backpropagation and Weight Updates

Backpropagation is used to compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases. These gradients are then used to update the weights and biases using an optimization algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.

### 3.5 Regularization Techniques

Regularization techniques, such as dropout and L2 regularization, are used to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model.
