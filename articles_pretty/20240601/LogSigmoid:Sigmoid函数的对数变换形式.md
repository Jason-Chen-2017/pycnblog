## 1. Background Introduction

In the realm of computer science, the Sigmoid function, also known as the logistic function, plays a pivotal role in various applications, such as neural networks, machine learning, and statistical modeling. This function, with its unique S-shaped curve, is instrumental in transforming continuous input values into output values between 0 and 1, making it an ideal choice for activation functions in artificial neural networks.

However, the Sigmoid function has a significant drawback: it tends to saturate at both ends, leading to slow learning and vanishing gradients, which can hinder the optimization process. To address this issue, we introduce the LogSigmoid function, a logarithmic transformation of the Sigmoid function, which offers improved performance and faster convergence.

## 2. Core Concepts and Connections

The LogSigmoid function is a mathematical transformation of the Sigmoid function, defined as follows:

$$
\\text{LogSigmoid}(x) = \\log \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \\right)
$$

By taking the natural logarithm of the Sigmoid function, we obtain the LogSigmoid function, which has a more linear behavior, reducing the saturation problem and improving the learning process.

## 3. Core Algorithm Principles and Specific Operational Steps

To implement the LogSigmoid function in your projects, follow these steps:

1. Define the LogSigmoid function in your programming language of choice, such as Python, C++, or Java.
2. In your neural network architecture, replace the Sigmoid activation function with the LogSigmoid function in the output layer and any hidden layers where necessary.
3. During the forward pass, calculate the LogSigmoid values for each neuron's output.
4. During the backpropagation phase, compute the gradients using the chain rule and the derivative of the LogSigmoid function:

$$
\\frac{d \\text{LogSigmoid}(x)}{dx} = \\frac{1}{x(1-x)}
$$

5. Update the weights and biases using the computed gradients and the learning rate.

## 4. Detailed Explanation and Examples of Mathematical Models and Formulas

Let's delve deeper into the mathematical properties of the LogSigmoid function.

### a. Derivative of the LogSigmoid Function

The derivative of the LogSigmoid function is crucial for backpropagation during the training process. We can calculate it using the chain rule:

$$
\\frac{d \\text{LogSigmoid}(x)}{dx} = \\frac{d \\log \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \\right)}{dx} = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\log \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \\right) \\right)
$$

To find the derivative of the logarithm, we use the following property:

$$
\\frac{d}{dx} \\log(x) = \\frac{1}{x}
$$

Now, we can simplify the derivative of the LogSigmoid function:

$$
\\frac{d \\text{LogSigmoid}(x)}{dx} = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}} = \\frac{1}{x(1-x)}
$$

### b. Comparison with Sigmoid Function

Comparing the LogSigmoid function with the Sigmoid function, we can see that the LogSigmoid function has a more linear behavior, as shown in Figure 1. This linearity reduces the saturation problem, making the LogSigmoid function more suitable for training deep neural networks.
