# From Scratch: Developing and Fine-Tuning Large Models: The Principles and Formulas of Feedback Neural Networks

## 1. Background Introduction

In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), large models have become increasingly important for a wide range of applications, from natural language processing (NLP) to computer vision. This article aims to provide a comprehensive guide for developers who wish to build and fine-tune large models from scratch, with a focus on feedback neural networks (FNNs).

### 1.1 The Rise of Large Models

The advent of large models can be attributed to the availability of massive amounts of data, the development of more powerful hardware, and the advancement of machine learning algorithms. These models, often referred to as deep learning models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in various tasks, such as image recognition, speech recognition, and machine translation.

### 1.2 The Role of Feedback Neural Networks

Feedback neural networks (FNNs) are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can process sequential data. They are particularly useful in tasks that require understanding the context, such as language modeling, speech recognition, and time series prediction. FNNs are characterized by their feedback connections, which allow information to flow in both directions between layers, enabling the network to maintain an internal state and remember past inputs.

## 2. Core Concepts and Connections

To understand FNNs, it is essential to grasp several core concepts, including neurons, activation functions, weights, biases, and backpropagation.

### 2.1 Neurons and Activation Functions

A neuron is the basic building block of a neural network. It receives input from other neurons, processes this input using an activation function, and produces an output. The activation function introduces non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn complex patterns. Common activation functions include the sigmoid, ReLU, and tanh functions.

### 2.2 Weights and Biases

Weights and biases are parameters that the network learns during training. Weights determine the strength of the connections between neurons, while biases allow for the adjustment of the neuron's output.

### 2.3 Backpropagation

Backpropagation is the algorithm used to train neural networks. It works by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases, and then adjusting these parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient. This process is repeated for multiple iterations until the network's performance on the training data improves.

### 2.4 Connections in Feedback Neural Networks

In FNNs, connections can be either feedforward or feedback. Feedforward connections transmit information from the input layer to the output layer, while feedback connections transmit information from the output layer back to the hidden layers. The feedback connections enable the network to maintain an internal state and remember past inputs.

## 3. Core Algorithm Principles and Specific Operational Steps

To develop and fine-tune FNNs, it is essential to understand the core algorithm principles and the specific operational steps involved.

### 3.1 Forward Propagation

The forward propagation process involves passing the input data through the network, computing the output of each neuron using the activation function, and updating the network's internal state.

### 3.2 Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)

Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) is a variant of backpropagation that is used for training RNNs, including FNNs. BPTT computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases by considering the entire sequence of inputs and outputs, rather than just a single time step.

### 3.3 Learning Rate and Momentum

The learning rate and momentum are hyperparameters that control the speed and direction of the weight updates during training. The learning rate determines the step size for each weight update, while momentum helps to stabilize the training process by averaging the weight updates over multiple iterations.

### 3.4 Regularization

Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. Common regularization techniques include L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, and early stopping.

## 4. Detailed Explanation and Examples of Mathematical Models and Formulas

To gain a deeper understanding of FNNs, it is essential to explore the mathematical models and formulas that underpin these networks.

### 4.1 Activation Functions

The sigmoid, ReLU, and tanh functions are among the most commonly used activation functions. The sigmoid function maps its input to a value between 0 and 1, while the ReLU and tanh functions produce outputs that range from -1 to 1 and -1 to 1, respectively.

### 4.2 Weight Updates

The weight updates during backpropagation are computed using the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights. For a single neuron, the weight update can be expressed as:

$$w_{ij} = w_{ij} - \\alpha \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_{ij}}$$

where $w_{ij}$ is the weight connecting the $i$-th input neuron to the $j$-th output neuron, $\\alpha$ is the learning rate, and $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_{ij}}$ is the partial derivative of the loss function with respect to the weight.

### 4.3 Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)

BPTT computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases by considering the entire sequence of inputs and outputs. The weight update for a single time step can be expressed as:

$$w_{ij}(t) = w_{ij}(t) - \\alpha \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_{ij}(t)}$$

where $w_{ij}(t)$ is the weight connecting the $i$-th input neuron at time $t$ to the $j$-th output neuron, $\\alpha$ is the learning rate, and $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_{ij}(t)}$ is the partial derivative of the loss function with respect to the weight at time $t$.

        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
