### 3.2 Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of creating meaningful features from raw data that can be used as input for machine learning algorithms. In the financial sector, common features include stock prices, trading volumes, and financial ratios.

### 3.3 Model Training

Model training is the process of teaching the AI agent to learn from the preprocessed data. This involves selecting an appropriate machine learning algorithm, training the model on the data, and fine-tuning the model to improve its performance.

### 3.4 Model Evaluation

Model evaluation is the process of assessing the performance of the trained AI agent. This involves testing the model on a separate dataset, calculating various performance metrics, and making adjustments to the model as necessary.

### 3.5 Model Deployment

Model deployment is the process of integrating the trained AI agent into the financial system. This involves implementing the AI agent in the appropriate software environment, setting up the necessary infrastructure, and monitoring the AI agent's performance in real-world scenarios.

Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables. In finance, linear regression can be used for tasks such as stock price prediction and credit risk assessment.

$$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + ... + \\beta_nx_n + \\epsilon$$

### 4.2 Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a binary outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables. In finance, logistic regression can be used for tasks such as fraud detection and customer segmentation.

$$P(y=1) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + ... + \\beta_nx_n)}}$$

### 4.3 Decision Trees

Decision trees are a type of supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. In finance, decision trees can be used for tasks such as credit scoring and portfolio optimization.

### 4.4 Random Forest

Random forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of predictions. In finance, random forest can be used for tasks such as stock price prediction and credit risk assessment.
