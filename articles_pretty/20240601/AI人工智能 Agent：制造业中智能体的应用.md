### 5.1 Predictive Maintenance

Predictive maintenance is a proactive approach to equipment maintenance that uses AI to predict when maintenance is required. This can help reduce downtime, improve equipment lifespan, and lower maintenance costs.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('equipment_data.csv')

# Preprocess data
X = data[['temperature', 'vibration', 'lubrication']]
y = data['failure']

# Train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict failure
failure_prediction = model.predict([[30, 5, 0]])
```

### 5.2 Quality Control

AI agents can be used for quality control in manufacturing by analyzing data from various sensors and identifying defects in products.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('defect_data.csv')

# Preprocess data
X = data[['length', 'width', 'thickness']]
y = data['defect']

# Train model
model = SVC(kernel='rbf', gamma=0.1, C=10)
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict defects
defect_prediction = model.predict([[3, 2, 1]])
```
