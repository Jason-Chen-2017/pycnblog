### Mathematical Models and Formulas & Detailed Explanation & Examples

In this section, we will delve into the mathematical models and formulas that underpin the core algorithms discussed in the previous section. Understanding these mathematical foundations is crucial for implementing and optimizing supply chain strategies in e-commerce platforms. We will provide detailed explanations and examples to illustrate the practical application of these models.

#### 1. Demand Forecasting Model

**Exponential Smoothing Model**

One of the most commonly used demand forecasting models is the Exponential Smoothing (ES) model. This model assigns exponentially decreasing weights to past observations, with the most recent data receiving the highest weight.

**Formula**:

$$
\text{Forecast}_t = \alpha \times \text{Actual}_t + (1 - \alpha) \times \text{Forecast}_{t-1}
$$

where:
- $\text{Forecast}_t$ is the forecast for period t,
- $\text{Actual}_t$ is the actual demand for period t,
- $\alpha$ is the smoothing factor (0 < $\alpha$ < 1).

**Example**:

Assume a retailer wants to forecast daily demand for a specific product using the Exponential Smoothing model. The smoothing factor $\alpha$ is set to 0.2. The following are the actual daily demands for the past five days: 100, 110, 115, 120, and 125.

**Calculation**:

$$
\text{Forecast}_1 = 0.2 \times 100 + 0.8 \times 100 = 100
$$

$$
\text{Forecast}_2 = 0.2 \times 110 + 0.8 \times 100 = 102
$$

$$
\text{Forecast}_3 = 0.2 \times 115 + 0.8 \times 102 = 104.6
$$

$$
\text{Forecast}_4 = 0.2 \times 120 + 0.8 \times 104.6 = 107.08
$$

$$
\text{Forecast}_5 = 0.2 \times 125 + 0.8 \times 107.08 = 109.536
$$

The retailer can use these forecasts to plan inventory and production levels.

#### 2. Inventory Management Model

**Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Model**

The EOQ model is used to determine the optimal order quantity that minimizes total inventory costs, including holding costs and ordering costs.

**Formula**:

$$
\text{EOQ} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times D \times S}{H}}
$$

where:
- $D$ is the annual demand (units),
- $S$ is the ordering cost per order,
- $H$ is the holding cost per unit per year.

**Example**:

Assume a company has an annual demand for raw material of 10,000 units, an ordering cost of $50 per order, and a holding cost of $2 per unit per year.

**Calculation**:

$$
\text{EOQ} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 10,000 \times 50}{2}} = \sqrt{500,000} = 707.11 \approx 707
$$

The company should order 707 units each time to minimize inventory costs.

#### 3. Logistics Management Model

**Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)**

The VRP is a combinatorial optimization problem that aims to find the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to multiple customers while minimizing total distance traveled and time.

**Objective Function**:

Minimize $\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_{ij} x_{ij}$

where:
- $d_{ij}$ is the distance between customer $i$ and customer $j$,
- $x_{ij}$ is a binary variable indicating whether vehicle $i$ visits customer $j$.

**Constraints**:

1. Each customer must be visited exactly once.
2. Each vehicle must return to the depot.
3. Vehicle capacity constraints must be satisfied.

**Example**:

A logistics company has a fleet of three vehicles and needs to deliver goods to five customers. The distances from the depot to each customer are as follows:

- Customer A: 10 km
- Customer B: 15 km
- Customer C: 20 km
- Customer D: 25 km
- Customer E: 30 km

Each vehicle has a capacity of 50 km.

**Solution**:

One possible solution is to assign the following routes to the vehicles:

- Vehicle 1: Depot → A → B → Depot
- Vehicle 2: Depot → C → D → Depot
- Vehicle 3: Depot → E → Depot

The total distance traveled is 10 + 15 + 10 + 20 + 25 + 20 + 25 + 30 = 175 km, which satisfies the vehicle capacity constraints.

#### 4. Supply Chain Integration Model

**Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, and Replenishment (CPFR)**

CPFR is a collaborative approach that involves sharing forecasts, plans, and transaction data between supply chain partners to improve demand forecasting and inventory management.

**Process**:

1. **Planning**: Partners collaborate to develop a shared demand plan.
2. **Forecasting**: Partners share their forecasts and adjust them based on market trends and internal factors.
3. **Replenishment**: Partners coordinate the replenishment of inventory based on the agreed-upon demand plan.

**Example**:

A retailer and a supplier collaborate using CPFR. The retailer forecasts a 10% increase in demand for a specific product. The supplier adjusts its production plan accordingly, leading to an increase in the product's availability in the retailer's inventory.

In conclusion, these mathematical models and formulas provide the foundation for optimizing supply chain processes in e-commerce platforms. By understanding and applying these models, businesses can make informed decisions that enhance supply capability, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction.
