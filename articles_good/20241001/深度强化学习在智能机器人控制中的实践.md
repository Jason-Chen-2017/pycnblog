## Background Introduction

### 1. Definition and Basic Concepts of Deep Reinforcement Learning

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a subfield of both Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Learning (DL). RL is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make a sequence of decisions by receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The goal is to find a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward over time. DRL extends this idea by using deep neural networks to approximate the policy or the value function. This approach is particularly useful for solving problems with high-dimensional state and action spaces.

In DRL, the agent interacts with an environment, observing the current state, selecting an action based on the current state, and receiving a reward or penalty based on the action taken. The agent's goal is to learn a policy that maps states to actions in order to maximize the cumulative reward. Unlike traditional RL, which might rely on handcrafted features, DRL can automatically learn complex representations of the state space through the use of deep neural networks.

### 2. Importance of DRL in Intelligent Robot Control

Intelligent robot control is a critical area in robotics where traditional rule-based approaches are often insufficient to handle the complexity and dynamism of real-world environments. DRL offers a more flexible and efficient way to enable robots to autonomously adapt to various complex environments and tasks. The ability of DRL to learn from interaction and continuously improve its performance makes it an ideal candidate for applications in robotics, such as navigation, manipulation, and task automation.

The significance of DRL in intelligent robot control can be highlighted in several aspects:

- **Complexity Handling**: Robots often operate in environments with high-dimensional state spaces and complex action spaces. DRL's use of deep neural networks enables it to learn and represent complex state-action value functions, making it suitable for handling such complexities.
- **Autonomous Learning**: DRL allows robots to learn autonomously without requiring extensive manual tuning or programming. This reduces the need for human experts and accelerates the development of intelligent robotic systems.
- **Adaptability**: Robots in dynamic environments need to adapt to changing conditions. DRL enables continuous learning and adaptation, allowing robots to maintain optimal performance over time.
- **Scalability**: DRL can be applied to a wide range of robot control problems, from simple tasks to complex, multi-agent systems. Its scalable nature makes it a powerful tool for developing intelligent robotic systems across different domains.

### 3. Challenges and Opportunities in DRL for Intelligent Robot Control

Despite its numerous advantages, DRL in intelligent robot control also faces several challenges and opportunities:

- **Data Collection**: DRL requires a large amount of data for training, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. Collecting representative and diverse datasets is crucial for the success of DRL applications in robotics.
- **Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off**: Balancing exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (using known effective actions) is challenging in DRL. This trade-off is crucial for learning optimal policies in complex environments.
- **Safety and Robustness**: Ensuring the safety and robustness of DRL-based robot controllers is critical. Robots must be able to handle unexpected situations and avoid harmful actions.
- **Generalization**: DRL models often overfit to the training data, limiting their generalization to new and unseen environments. Developing methods for improving generalization is an important research direction.
- **Real-time Performance**: Real-time control is essential for many robotic applications. Optimizing the computational complexity of DRL algorithms to achieve real-time performance is an ongoing challenge.

In conclusion, DRL presents a promising approach for intelligent robot control, offering flexibility, autonomy, and adaptability. However, addressing the associated challenges is crucial for the successful application of DRL in real-world robotics. The following sections of this article will delve deeper into the core concepts, algorithms, and practical applications of DRL in intelligent robot control.

### Core Concepts and Relationships

To fully understand the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in intelligent robot control, it's essential to grasp the core concepts and their interrelationships. This section will outline the fundamental principles of DRL and provide a detailed Mermaid flowchart illustrating the DRL architecture.

#### 1. Agent, Environment, State, and Action

The basic components of DRL include the agent, environment, state, and action. 

- **Agent**: The learner or decision-maker that learns from the environment and acts based on the current state.
- **Environment**: The surrounding in which the agent operates, providing feedback through rewards and penalties.
- **State**: A set of features describing the current situation of the agent.
- **Action**: A decision made by the agent based on the current state.

#### 2. Policy, Value Function, and Q-Learning

DRL employs several key concepts to learn optimal behaviors:

- **Policy**: A mapping from states to actions that the agent should take. The goal is to find a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward.
- **Value Function**: An estimate of the expected cumulative reward for an agent starting from a given state and following a given policy.
- **Q-Learning**: An algorithm used to learn the optimal action-value function (Q-function). The Q-function estimates the quality of an action taken in a specific state.

#### 3. Deep Neural Networks

DRL leverages the power of deep neural networks to approximate the policy or value function:

- **Neural Network**: A computational model composed of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons). Each layer transforms the input data through a series of mathematical operations.
- **Feedforward Neural Networks**: A type of neural network where the information flows in only one direction—from the input layer through one or more hidden layers to the output layer.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Specialized neural networks capable of processing sequences of inputs and maintaining state information.

#### 4. DRL Architecture

The architecture of a DRL system typically consists of the following components:

- **Actor-Critic Architecture**: An extension of the Q-learning algorithm that uses both an actor (policy) and a critic (value function) to improve the learning process.
- **Reinforce Algorithm**: A basic DRL algorithm that updates the policy based on the returns received from the environment.
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: An improved version of Q-learning that uses a deep neural network to approximate the Q-function.
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: An algorithm that improves the stability and sample efficiency of policy gradient methods.

#### Mermaid Flowchart

Below is a Mermaid flowchart illustrating the DRL architecture and key components:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Agent] --> B[Observes State]
    B --> C[Chooses Action]
    C --> D[Executes Action]
    D --> E[Observes Reward]
    E --> F[Updates Q-Value]
    F --> G[Policy Update]
    G --> H[Observes Next State]
    H --> A
```

In this flowchart:
- The agent observes the current state of the environment.
- The agent chooses an action based on the current state using a policy.
- The agent executes the chosen action and receives a reward from the environment.
- The agent updates the Q-value based on the reward and the new state.
- The policy is updated based on the new Q-value.
- The process continues as the agent transitions to the next state and repeats the steps.

This Mermaid flowchart provides a visual representation of the DRL process, helping to illustrate how the agent learns and improves its behavior through interaction with the environment.

### Core Algorithm Principles & Operational Steps

Understanding the core principles of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and its operational steps is crucial for implementing DRL in intelligent robot control. In this section, we will delve into the basic concepts of DRL, the Q-learning algorithm, and the REINFORCE algorithm, along with step-by-step explanations and examples.

#### 1. Basic Concepts of DRL

DRL is a branch of reinforcement learning that leverages deep neural networks to approximate the value function or policy. Here are the fundamental concepts:

- **Policy**: A mapping from states to actions that determines how the agent behaves. The goal is to find a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward.
- **Value Function**: An estimate of the expected cumulative reward for an agent starting from a given state and following a given policy. The value function can be divided into state-value function (V(s)) and action-value function (Q(s, a)).
- **Q-Learning**: An algorithm used to learn the action-value function (Q-function). The Q-function estimates the quality of an action taken in a specific state.
- **Experience Replay**: A technique used to store and sample past experiences, which helps in stabilizing the learning process and preventing the agent from getting stuck in local optima.

#### 2. Q-Learning Algorithm

Q-Learning is one of the most fundamental algorithms in DRL. It uses a Q-table to store the Q-values (action-value estimates) for all possible state-action pairs.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. **Initialization**: Initialize the Q-table with random values. Set the learning rate (α), discount factor (γ), and exploration rate (ε).
2. **Select Action**: At each time step, the agent selects an action using an ε-greedy strategy. With probability ε, the agent explores and chooses a random action; with probability 1 - ε, the agent exploits and chooses the action with the highest Q-value.
3. **Execute Action**: The agent executes the selected action in the environment and observes the reward (r) and the next state (s').
4. **Update Q-Value**: Update the Q-value for the state-action pair using the following equation:

   $$ Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + α[r + γ\max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)] $$

5. **Transition**: Set the current state (s) to the next state (s') and repeat steps 2-4 until the termination condition is met (e.g., the episode ends or a certain number of steps have been taken).

**Example:**

Consider a simple environment with two states (A and B) and two actions (Up and Down). The initial Q-table is as follows:

| State | Action | Q-Value |
|-------|--------|---------|
| A     | Up     | 0.0     |
| A     | Down   | 0.0     |
| B     | Up     | 0.0     |
| B     | Down   | 0.0     |

At time step t, the agent is in state A and chooses action Up (exploit, as ε = 0). The action leads to a reward of +1 and the next state B. The Q-value for (A, Up) is updated as follows:

$$ Q(A, Up) \leftarrow Q(A, Up) + α[r + γ\max_{a'} Q(B, a') - Q(A, Up)] $$
$$ Q(A, Up) \leftarrow 0.0 + 0.1[1 + 0.9\max(0.0, 0.0) - 0.0] $$
$$ Q(A, Up) \leftarrow 0.1 + 0.1[1 - 0.0] $$
$$ Q(A, Up) \leftarrow 0.1 + 0.1 $$
$$ Q(A, Up) \leftarrow 0.2 $$

The updated Q-table is:

| State | Action | Q-Value |
|-------|--------|---------|
| A     | Up     | 0.2     |
| A     | Down   | 0.0     |
| B     | Up     | 0.0     |
| B     | Down   | 0.0     |

#### 3. REINFORCE Algorithm

The REINFORCE algorithm is a policy gradient method that updates the policy directly based on the returns received from the environment. It does not require a Q-table or an action-value function.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. **Initialization**: Initialize the policy parameters (θ) and set the learning rate (α).
2. **Select Action**: At each time step, the agent selects an action based on the current policy.
3. **Execute Action**: The agent executes the selected action in the environment and receives a reward (r).
4. **Update Policy**: Update the policy parameters using the following gradient-based update rule:

   $$ θ \leftarrow θ + α \sum_{t=0}^{T} \nabla_{\theta} log(\pi(a_t | s_t, θ)) \cdot r_t $$

where \( T \) is the length of the episode, \( a_t \) is the action taken at time step \( t \), \( s_t \) is the state at time step \( t \), and \( \pi(a_t | s_t, θ) \) is the policy given by the current parameters \( θ \).

**Example:**

Consider a binary policy with two actions (0 and 1) represented by the probability \( π(a_t | θ) = sigmoid(w \cdot s_t) \), where \( w \) is the policy parameter and \( sigmoid \) is the logistic function.

At time step t, the agent is in state [1, 0] and selects action 1 (exploit). The logistic function gives a probability of 0.7 for action 1 and 0.3 for action 0. The reward is +1. The gradient of the logistic function with respect to the parameter \( w \) is:

$$ \nabla_{w} log(sigmoid(w \cdot s_t)) = (1 - sigmoid(w \cdot s_t)) \cdot s_t $$

The gradient for action 1 is:

$$ \nabla_{w} log(sigmoid(w \cdot s_t)) = (1 - 0.7) \cdot 1 = 0.3 $$

The gradient for action 0 is:

$$ \nabla_{w} log(sigmoid(w \cdot s_t)) = (1 - 0.3) \cdot 0 = 0 $$

The parameter update is:

$$ w \leftarrow w + α \cdot \nabla_{w} log(sigmoid(w \cdot s_t)) \cdot r_t $$
$$ w \leftarrow w + 0.1 \cdot 0.3 \cdot 1 $$
$$ w \leftarrow w + 0.03 $$

The updated parameter \( w \) leads to a higher probability for action 1 in the next state.

#### Conclusion

In this section, we discussed the basic concepts and operational steps of DRL, focusing on the Q-learning and REINFORCE algorithms. These algorithms provide a foundation for understanding how DRL can be applied to intelligent robot control. By leveraging deep neural networks and reinforcement learning techniques, DRL enables robots to autonomously learn and adapt to complex environments, making it a powerful tool for advancing intelligent robotics.

### Mathematical Models, Detailed Explanations, and Examples

In this section, we will delve into the mathematical models and formulas that underpin Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), providing a detailed explanation of each concept and supporting them with practical examples. Understanding these models is crucial for effectively implementing and optimizing DRL algorithms in intelligent robot control.

#### 1. Q-Learning Algorithm: Q-Value Update Formula

The Q-learning algorithm is a model-free reinforcement learning technique used to learn the action-value function, often referred to as the Q-function. The Q-function estimates the expected utility of an action taken in a given state.

The Q-value update formula is given by:

$$ Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + α[r + γ\max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)] $$

Where:
- \( Q(s, a) \) is the action-value estimate for taking action \( a \) in state \( s \).
- \( α \) is the learning rate, controlling the step size of the update.
- \( r \) is the immediate reward received after taking action \( a \) in state \( s \).
- \( γ \) is the discount factor, determining the importance of future rewards.
- \( s' \) is the next state.
- \( a' \) is the optimal action in the next state.

**Example:**

Consider a simple environment with two states, A and B, and two actions, Up and Down. The Q-table is initialized as follows:

| State | Action | Q-Value |
|-------|--------|---------|
| A     | Up     | 0.0     |
| A     | Down   | 0.0     |
| B     | Up     | 0.0     |
| B     | Down   | 0.0     |

The agent is in state A and takes action Up, resulting in a reward of +1 and transitioning to state B. The Q-value for (A, Up) is updated as:

$$ Q(A, Up) \leftarrow Q(A, Up) + α[r + γ\max_{a'} Q(B, a') - Q(A, Up)] $$

Let's assume \( α = 0.1 \) and \( γ = 0.9 \). The Q-value for (B, Up) is 0.5, and there are no other actions available. The update is:

$$ Q(A, Up) \leftarrow 0.0 + 0.1[1 + 0.9 \cdot 0.5 - 0.0] $$
$$ Q(A, Up) \leftarrow 0.1 + 0.1[1 + 0.45] $$
$$ Q(A, Up) \leftarrow 0.1 + 0.1[1.45] $$
$$ Q(A, Up) \leftarrow 0.1 + 0.145 $$
$$ Q(A, Up) \leftarrow 0.245 $$

The updated Q-table is:

| State | Action | Q-Value |
|-------|--------|---------|
| A     | Up     | 0.245   |
| A     | Down   | 0.0     |
| B     | Up     | 0.0     |
| B     | Down   | 0.0     |

#### 2. REINFORCE Algorithm: Policy Gradient Update Rule

The REINFORCE algorithm is a policy gradient method that updates the policy directly based on the returns received from the environment. The policy gradient update rule is given by:

$$ θ \leftarrow θ + α \sum_{t=0}^{T} \nabla_{θ} log(\pi(a_t | s_t, θ)) \cdot r_t $$

Where:
- \( θ \) represents the parameters of the policy.
- \( \pi(a_t | s_t, θ) \) is the probability of taking action \( a_t \) in state \( s_t \) under the policy parameterized by \( θ \).
- \( r_t \) is the reward received at time step \( t \).
- \( T \) is the total number of time steps in the episode.
- \( α \) is the learning rate.

**Example:**

Suppose we have a binary policy represented by a single parameter \( w \), where the probability of taking action 1 is given by \( π(a_t | θ) = sigmoid(w \cdot s_t) \). The logistic function is defined as:

$$ sigmoid(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} $$

The gradient of the logistic function with respect to \( w \) is:

$$ \nabla_{w} sigmoid(w \cdot s_t) = sigmoid(w \cdot s_t) \cdot (1 - sigmoid(w \cdot s_t)) $$

At time step \( t \), the agent is in state [1, 0], and the action taken is 1 (exploit). The reward is +1. The gradient of the logistic function is:

$$ \nabla_{w} sigmoid(w \cdot s_t) = sigmoid(w \cdot s_t) \cdot (1 - sigmoid(w \cdot s_t)) = 0.7 \cdot 0.3 = 0.21 $$

The parameter update is:

$$ w \leftarrow w + α \cdot \nabla_{w} log(sigmoid(w \cdot s_t)) \cdot r_t $$
$$ w \leftarrow w + 0.1 \cdot 0.21 \cdot 1 $$
$$ w \leftarrow w + 0.021 $$

After the update, the new parameter \( w \) increases the probability of taking action 1 in the next state.

#### 3. Deep Q-Network (DQN): Experience Replay and Double Q-Learning

DQN is an extension of Q-learning that uses deep neural networks to approximate the Q-function. Two important techniques used in DQN are experience replay and double Q-learning.

**Experience Replay:**

Experience replay is a technique used to store and sample past experiences, which helps in stabilizing the learning process and preventing the agent from getting stuck in local optima.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. **Initialize**: Create a replay memory with a fixed size.
2. **Experience Collection**: At each time step, store the current state, action, reward, and next state in the replay memory.
3. **Sample and Train**: Periodically, sample a batch of experiences from the replay memory and use them to train the Q-network.

**Example:**

Suppose the replay memory contains the following experiences:

| Episode | State | Action | Reward | Next State |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|------------|
| 1       | [0, 1]| 0      | -1     | [1, 0]     |
| 2       | [1, 0]| 1      | +1     | [0, 1]     |
| 3       | [0, 1]| 1      | -1     | [1, 0]     |

A batch of two experiences is randomly selected for training.

**Double Q-Learning:**

Double Q-learning is used to improve the stability of Q-learning by combining the outputs of two separate Q-networks. It helps to reduce the overestimation of Q-values.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. **Select Action**: Use the primary Q-network to select an action.
2. **Evaluate Action**: Use the target Q-network to evaluate the selected action.
3. **Update Q-Values**: Update the primary Q-network using the evaluated action.

**Example:**

The primary Q-network suggests taking action 0 in state [0, 1], while the target Q-network suggests taking action 1 in the same state. The primary Q-network updates its Q-value using the target Q-network's evaluation.

#### 4. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): Optimizing Policy Gradient

PPO is a policy gradient method that addresses the instability and inefficiency of traditional policy gradient methods. It uses a clipped surrogate objective to ensure the update is in the direction of improving the expected return.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. **Sample Trajectories**: Sample trajectories from the current policy.
2. **Evaluate Gains**: Calculate the gains for each trajectory.
3. **Clip Loss**: Clip the surrogate objective to ensure the update is within a certain threshold.
4. **Update Policy**: Apply the clipped surrogate objective to update the policy parameters.

**Example:**

Suppose a trajectory generates a gain of 0.2. The clipped surrogate objective is calculated as:

$$ J(\theta) = r + γ\sum_{t=1}^{T} \gamma^{t-1} Q(s_t, a_t | \theta) - \rho \cdot \pi(a_t | s_t, \theta) $$

where \( \rho \) is the clip ratio. If the actual gain is 0.2 and the clipped gain is 0.15, the policy parameters are updated using the clipped gain.

By understanding these mathematical models and their detailed explanations, we can better implement and optimize DRL algorithms for intelligent robot control. These models provide a foundation for developing efficient and effective DRL-based robot control systems.

### Project Practice: Code Example and Detailed Explanation

In this section, we will delve into a real-world project that demonstrates the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in intelligent robot control. We will provide a detailed explanation of the development environment setup, the source code implementation, and a thorough analysis of the code.

#### 1. Development Environment Setup

To begin with, we need to set up the development environment for implementing DRL in intelligent robot control. The following tools and libraries are required:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for implementing DRL algorithms.
- **TensorFlow or PyTorch**: Deep learning frameworks for building and training neural networks.
- **OpenAI Gym**: A Python library that provides a wide range of environments for testing and evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms.
- **Robot Operating System (ROS)**: A framework for building robot applications.

   pip install gym
   pip install rospkg
   pip install rospy
   ```

2. **Set up ROS**: Follow the official ROS installation instructions to set up the Robot Operating System. Ensure that the ROS environment variables are correctly configured.

3. **Configure TensorFlow or PyTorch**: Configure the deep learning framework (TensorFlow or PyTorch) according to the official documentation.

4. **Test the setup**: Run a simple ROS node or a TensorFlow/PyTorch script to verify that the development environment is correctly set up.

#### 2. Source Code Implementation

The source code for the project consists of several key components: the environment, the DRL agent, the neural network model, and the training loop. Below is a high-level overview of the source code structure and its components.

**Environment:**

The environment is defined using OpenAI Gym. For this example, we will use the `CartPole-v0` environment, a classic reinforcement learning task where the goal is to keep a pole balanced on a cart for as long as possible.

```python
import gym

# Create the environment
env = gym.make('CartPole-v0')

# Reset the environment
state = env.reset()

# Close the environment
env.close()
```

**DRL Agent:**

The DRL agent is implemented using a deep neural network. For this example, we will use a simple feedforward neural network with two hidden layers.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the neural network model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(4,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Summary of the model
model.summary()
```

**Neural Network Model:**

The neural network model is defined using TensorFlow. The model takes the state as input and outputs the probability of taking each action.

```python
# Define the neural network model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(4,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Summary of the model
model.summary()
```

**Training Loop:**

The training loop involves feeding the environment's states and rewards to the neural network and updating the model parameters using gradient descent.

```python
# Training loop
for episode in range(1000):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    total_reward = 0
    
    while not done:
        # Predict the action probabilities
        action_probs = model.predict(state.reshape(-1, 4))
        
        # Select the action with the highest probability
        action = np.random.choice(a=2, p=action_probs[0])
        
        # Execute the action
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        
        # Update the total reward
        total_reward += reward
        
        # Prepare the experience tuple
        experience = (state, action, reward, next_state, done)
        
        # Store the experience in a replay memory
        replay_memory.append(experience)
        
        # Update the neural network
        if len(replay_memory) > batch_size:
            batch = random.sample(replay_memory, batch_size)
            states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones = zip(*batch)
            target_values = calculate_target_values(next_states, rewards, dones, model, gamma)
            model.fit(states, target_values, epochs=1, batch_size=batch_size)
        
        # Update the state
        state = next_state
    
    # Print the episode reward
    print(f"Episode {episode}: Total Reward = {total_reward}")
```

#### 3. Code Analysis and Explanation

In this section, we will analyze the key components of the source code and explain how they work together to implement DRL for intelligent robot control.

**Environment:**

The environment is created using OpenAI Gym's `CartPole-v0` environment. The environment is reset to generate the initial state, and the training loop continues until the episode ends.

```python
env = gym.make('CartPole-v0')
state = env.reset()
```

**DRL Agent:**

The DRL agent is implemented using a feedforward neural network. The model takes the state as input and outputs the probability of taking each action. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.

```python
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(4,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

**Training Loop:**

The training loop involves feeding the environment's states and rewards to the neural network and updating the model parameters using gradient descent. The action probabilities are predicted using the model, and the action with the highest probability is selected. The next state and reward are obtained by executing the selected action, and the experience is stored in a replay memory. The model is updated periodically using a batch of experiences sampled from the replay memory.

```python
for episode in range(1000):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    total_reward = 0
    
    while not done:
        action_probs = model.predict(state.reshape(-1, 4))
        action = np.random.choice(a=2, p=action_probs[0])
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        total_reward += reward
        experience = (state, action, reward, next_state, done)
        replay_memory.append(experience)
        
        if len(replay_memory) > batch_size:
            batch = random.sample(replay_memory, batch_size)
            states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones = zip(*batch)
            target_values = calculate_target_values(next_states, rewards, dones, model, gamma)
            model.fit(states, target_values, epochs=1, batch_size=batch_size)
        
        state = next_state
    
    print(f"Episode {episode}: Total Reward = {total_reward}")
