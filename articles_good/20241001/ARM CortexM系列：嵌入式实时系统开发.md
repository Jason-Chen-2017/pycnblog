## Core Concepts and Relationships

### Background of Real-Time Embedded Systems

Real-time embedded systems are a subset of embedded systems that are designed to perform specific tasks within strict timing constraints. Unlike traditional embedded systems, which may have more flexible timing requirements, real-time systems must meet their deadlines consistently to ensure correct operation. These systems are commonly found in applications such as industrial control systems, automotive electronics, medical devices, and aerospace systems.

### Introduction to ARM Cortex-M Series Processors

The ARM Cortex-M series is a family of 32-bit RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) processors designed by ARM Holdings. These processors are optimized for embedded systems, providing high performance with low power consumption. The Cortex-M series includes various models, such as Cortex-M0, Cortex-M3, Cortex-M4, and Cortex-M7, each offering different performance levels and feature sets to cater to various application requirements.

### Working Principles of ARM Cortex-M Processors

ARM Cortex-M processors operate based on the ARMv7-M architecture, which features a single-issue pipelined design and a 3-stage pipeline (Instruction Fetch, Instruction Decode, and Execution). This architecture ensures high instruction throughput and efficient execution of tasks. The processors also include essential features like memory protection units (MPU), Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC), and system timers, which are crucial for real-time system development.

### Mermaid Flowchart of ARM Cortex-M Processor Workflow

To visualize the workflow of ARM Cortex-M processors, we can use a Mermaid flowchart. Below is an example of how the processor executes instructions and handles interrupts:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A(Instruction Fetch) --> B(Instruction Decode)
    B --> C(Execution)
    C --> D(Cache Access)
    D --> E(Interrupt Handling)
    E --> F(Return from Interrupt)
    F --> A

    subgraph Interrupt Workflow
        G(Interrupt Request)
        H(NVIC Handling)
        I(Interrupt Service Routine)
        J(Return from Interrupt)
        G --> H
        H --> I
        I --> J
    end
```

In this flowchart, the main processing loop includes instruction fetch, decode, and execution stages, followed by potential cache access and interrupt handling. The interrupt workflow subgraph illustrates how the processor responds to interrupt requests, handles them through the NVIC, executes the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR), and then returns from the interrupt.

---

## Core Algorithm Principles & Operation Steps

### Instruction Set Architecture of ARM Cortex-M Processors

The ARM Cortex-M series processors are based on the ARMv7-M architecture, which features a 32-bit instruction set architecture (ISA). This ISA includes a variety of instructions that are used for arithmetic operations, data manipulation, and control flow. Some key instruction types are:

- **Data Processing Instructions (DPIs)**: These instructions perform arithmetic and logical operations on data in registers.
- **Load and Store Instructions**: These instructions transfer data between registers and memory.
- **Branch Instructions**: These instructions alter the program flow by jumping to different parts of the code.
- **System Instructions**: These instructions are used for managing the processor state, handling interrupts, and accessing system peripherals.

### Interrupt Handling Mechanism

Interrupt handling is a critical feature of real-time embedded systems. ARM Cortex-M processors use the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC) to manage interrupts efficiently. The NVIC provides several features, including:

- **Priority Levels**: Each interrupt has a priority level that determines the order in which interrupts are handled.
- **Vectored Interrupts**: Interrupts are handled by specific memory locations called interrupt vectors, which contain the addresses of the interrupt service routines (ISRs).
- **Nested Interrupts**: ARM Cortex-M processors support nested interrupts, allowing high-priority interrupts to interrupt lower-priority interrupts.

### Steps for Configuring Interrupts

Configuring interrupts in ARM Cortex-M processors involves the following steps:

1. **Enable Interrupts**: Set the appropriate bits in the System Control Block (SCB) to enable global interrupts.
2. **Configure NVIC Priorities**: Set the priority levels for each interrupt in the NVIC.
3. **Write Interrupt Handlers**: Define interrupt service routines (ISRs) for each interrupt. These routines should be placed at the corresponding interrupt vector addresses.
4. **Enable Specific Interrupts**: Set the interrupt enable bits in the NVIC to enable specific interrupts.

### Example of Interrupt Handling

Consider the following example of an interrupt service routine for a timer interrupt:

```c
void Timer_ISR(void) {
    // Read the timer register to clear the interrupt
    uint32_t timer_value = TIMx->CNT;

    // Update the system time
    SystemTime++;

    // Perform other tasks, such as logging or control actions
    // ...

    // Return from the interrupt
    __ISB();
}
```

In this example, the `Timer_ISR` function is called when the timer interrupt occurs. It first reads the timer register to clear the interrupt, updates the system time, and performs other tasks. Finally, it returns from the interrupt using the `__ISB()` intrinsic function to ensure proper instruction fetch alignment.

## Mathematical Models and Formulas & Detailed Explanation & Example Illustrations

### Timing and Synchronization in Real-Time Systems

Real-time embedded systems often require precise timing and synchronization to meet strict deadlines. This involves the use of various mathematical models and formulas to calculate timing requirements, such as:

- **Period**: The time interval between consecutive occurrences of an event, typically measured in seconds.
- **Frequency**: The number of events per second, measured in hertz (Hz).
- **Deadline**: The time by which a task must complete to meet its requirements.

### Example of Periodic Timing Calculation

Consider a real-time system that needs to execute a specific task every 10 milliseconds. The system clock frequency is 100 MHz (100,000,000 Hz).

1. **Calculate the period (T)**:
   \[ T = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{100,000,000 \text{ Hz}} = 10^{-7} \text{ seconds} \]

2. **Calculate the number of clock cycles (N) required to complete one period**:
   \[ N = T \times f = 10^{-7} \text{ s} \times 100,000,000 \text{ Hz} = 10,000 \text{ cycles} \]

3. **Determine the number of clock cycles required to meet the 10 ms deadline**:
   \[ N_{deadline} = 10,000 \text{ cycles} \]

### Example of Deadline Calculation

Suppose a task has a maximum execution time of 5 ms and a deadline of 10 ms.

1. **Calculate the maximum execution time (T\_max)**:
   \[ T_{max} = 5 \text{ ms} = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ s} \]

2. **Calculate the deadline (D)**:
   \[ D = 10 \text{ ms} = 10 \times 10^{-3} \text{ s} \]

3. **Check if the task meets the deadline**:
   \[ T_{max} + T_{setup} \leq D \]
   where \( T_{setup} \) is the time required for the task to start executing after the trigger event.

### Example of Using Timers in ARM Cortex-M Processors

ARM Cortex-M processors include system timers, such as the SysTick timer, which can be used for precise timing and synchronization.

1. **Configure the SysTick timer**:
   - Set the load value (SYSTICK_LOAD) to the desired time period in clock cycles.
   - Enable the SysTick timer (SYSTICK_ENABLE).

2. **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) for the SysTick timer**:
   - Clear the SysTick interrupt (SYSTICK_CLR).
   - Update the system time or trigger other tasks.

```c
void SysTick_Handler(void) {
    // Clear the SysTick interrupt
    SysTick->CTRL &= ~(1 << 16);

    // Increment the system time
    SystemTime++;

    // Trigger other tasks or perform other actions
    // ...
}
```

### Example of Using Counters in ARM Cortex-M Processors

ARM Cortex-M processors also include general-purpose timers that can be used for counting events or measuring time intervals.

1. **Configure the timer**:
   - Set the timer mode (e.g., up-counting, down-counting).
   - Configure the timer clock source and prescaler.
   - Set the timer load value (e.g., the number of clock cycles for the desired time period).

2. **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) for the timer**:
   - Read the timer counter value to determine the elapsed time.
   - Clear the timer interrupt.
   - Perform other tasks or actions based on the elapsed time.

```c
void Timer_ISR(void) {
    // Read the timer counter value
    uint32_t timer_value = TIMx->CNT;

    // Calculate the elapsed time
    uint32_t elapsed_time = timer_value * timer_clock周期;

    // Clear the timer interrupt
    TIMx->SR &= ~(1 << 0);

    // Perform other tasks or actions based on the elapsed time
    // ...
}
```

By understanding these mathematical models and formulas, developers can ensure that their real-time embedded systems meet their timing requirements and perform reliably under various conditions.

## Practical Projects: Code Case Studies and Detailed Explanations

### Project Background and Objectives

For this practical project, we will develop a simple real-time system that monitors temperature and humidity levels using a DHT22 sensor and controls a DC motor based on these readings. The system will consist of an ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller (e.g., STM32F103C8T6) connected to the DHT22 sensor and the DC motor. The primary objectives are:

1. **Read temperature and humidity values from the DHT22 sensor**.
2. **Control the speed of the DC motor based on the temperature and humidity readings**.
3. **Implement proper interrupt handling and timing synchronization**.

### Development Environment Setup

2. **Install the STM32CubeMX Configuration Tool**: This tool helps configure the microcontroller peripherals and generates initialization code.
3. **Install the ARM GCC Toolchain**: This toolchain is used for compiling and building the project.
4. **Install the required libraries**:
   - **DHT22 Library**: This library provides functions to read data from the DHT22 sensor.
   - **PWM Library**: This library is used to control the speed of the DC motor.

### Source Code Implementation and Explanation

Below is a detailed explanation of the source code for this project.

#### 1. Project Structure

The project structure is organized into several files:

- **main.c**: The main application file.
- **dht22.c**: The DHT22 sensor library implementation.
- **dht22.h**: The header file for the DHT22 sensor library.
- **pwm.c**: The PWM library implementation.
- **pwm.h**: The header file for the PWM library.
- **config.h**: Configuration constants and defines.

#### 2. Main.c

The main application file initializes the microcontroller peripherals, reads sensor data, and controls the DC motor based on the readings. Here is the main.c file:

```c
#include "stm32f1xx_hal.h"
#include "dht22.h"
#include "pwm.h"

// Configuration constants
#define DHT22_PIN GPIO_PIN_0
#define MOTOR_PIN GPIO_PIN_1
#define DHT22_CLOCKSOURCE HAL_RCC_CLKSOURCE_APB2
#define MOTOR_CLOCKSOURCE HAL_RCC_CLKSOURCE_APB1

int main(void) {
    // Initialize the HAL
    HAL_Init();

    // Configure DHT22 sensor
    DHT22_Init(DHT22_CLOCKSOURCE, DHT22_PIN);

    // Configure DC motor
    PWM_Init(MOTOR_CLOCKSOURCE, MOTOR_PIN);

    while (1) {
        // Read temperature and humidity
        float temperature = DHT22_ReadTemperature();
        float humidity = DHT22_ReadHumidity();

        // Control the motor speed based on temperature and humidity
        if (temperature > 30.0) {
            PWM_SetDutyCycle(0.8); // Set the duty cycle to 80%
        } else {
            PWM_SetDutyCycle(0.3); // Set the duty cycle to 30%
        }

        // Delay for a specific period
        HAL_Delay(1000);
    }
}
```

In this code, we first initialize the HAL library, configure the DHT22 sensor, and the DC motor PWM. The main loop reads the temperature and humidity values, controls the motor speed based on the readings, and delays for one second.

#### 3. DHT22.c and DHT22.h

The DHT22.c and DHT22.h files contain the implementation and header for the DHT22 sensor library. Here is an example of the DHT22.c file:

```c
#include "dht22.h"

// Function prototypes
void DHT22_Init(void);
float DHT22_ReadTemperature(void);
float DHT22_ReadHumidity(void);

// Global variables
DHT22 dht22;

void DHT22_Init(void) {
    // Configure the GPIO pin for the DHT22 sensor
    GPIO_InitTypeDef GPIO_InitStruct = {0};
    __HAL_RCC_GPIOA_CLK_ENABLE();
    GPIO_InitStruct.Pin = DHT22_PIN;
    GPIO_InitStruct.Mode = GPIO_MODE_INPUT;
    GPIO_InitStruct.Pull = GPIO_NOPULL;
    HAL_GPIO_Init(GPIOA, &GPIO_InitStruct);

    // Initialize the DHT22 sensor
    dht22 = dht22_init(&GPIOA, DHT22_PIN, DHT22_CLOCKSOURCE);
}

float DHT22_ReadTemperature(void) {
    // Read the temperature from the DHT22 sensor
    return dht22.readTemperature();
}

float DHT22_ReadHumidity(void) {
    // Read the humidity from the DHT22 sensor
    return dht22.readHumidity();
}
```

In this code, we initialize the GPIO pin for the DHT22 sensor, create a global DHT22 structure, and provide functions to read the temperature and humidity values.

#### 4. PWM.c and PWM.h

The PWM.c and PWM.h files contain the implementation and header for the PWM library. Here is an example of the PWM.c file:

```c
#include "pwm.h"

// Function prototypes
void PWM_Init(void);
void PWM_SetDutyCycle(float dutyCycle);

// Global variables
TIM_HandleTypeDef htim1;

void PWM_Init(void) {
    // Configure the PWM timer
    htim1.Instance = TIM1;
    htim1.Init.Prescaler = 0;
    htim1.Init.CounterMode = TIM_COUNTERMODE_UP;
    htim1.Init.Period = 1000 - 1;
    htim1.Init.ClockDivision = TIM_CLOCKDIVISION_DIV1;
    htim1.Init.RepetitionCounter = 0;
    HAL_TIM_PWM_Init(&htim1);

    // Configure the PWM channel for the DC motor
    TIM_OC_InitTypeDef sConfigOC = {0};
    sConfigOC.OCMode = TIM_OCMODE_PWM1;
    sConfigOC.Pulse = 500;
    sConfigOC.OCPolarity = TIM_OCPOLARITY_HIGH;
    sConfigOC.OCFastMode = TIM_OCFAST_DISABLE;
    HAL_TIM_PWM_ConfigChannel(&htim1, &sConfigOC, TIM_CHANNEL_1);
}

void PWM_SetDutyCycle(float dutyCycle) {
    // Set the PWM duty cycle for the DC motor
    TIM_HandleTypeDef htim1;
    htim1.Instance = TIM1;
    __HAL_TIM_SET_COMPARE(&htim1, TIM_CHANNEL_1, (uint32_t)(dutyCycle * htim1.Init.Period));
}
```

In this code, we configure the PWM timer and provide a function to set the duty cycle for the DC motor.
