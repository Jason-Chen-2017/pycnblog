### Core Algorithm Principles & Specific Steps

Building a technology stack involves not only selecting the right tools but also understanding the core algorithms and principles that underpin these tools. Here, we will delve into the core algorithm principles and outline specific steps for implementing them in a cost-effective manner.

#### Front-End Frameworks

**1. React**: React uses a component-based architecture, allowing developers to create reusable UI components. The core algorithm in React is the Virtual DOM, which minimizes the number of direct manipulations of the actual DOM. To implement React, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up React Project**: Use `create-react-app` to bootstrap a new React project.
   $$\text{npm install create-react-app && npx create-react-app my-app}$$
   
2. **Create Components**: Develop reusable components using JSX syntax.
   ```jsx
   function Greeting(props) {
     return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
   }
   ```

3. **Manage State**: Use the useState hook to manage the state of your components.
   ```jsx
   import React, { useState } from 'react';

   function App() {
     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

     return (
       <div>
         <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
         <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
           Click me
         </button>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

**2. Angular**: Angular uses dependency injection to manage the flow of dependencies between different components and services. To implement Angular, follow these steps:

   <!-- app.component.html -->
   <h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>
   <p>My favorite number is: {{ favoriteNumber }}</p>
   <button (click)="increase()">Increase</button>
   ```

3. **Manage State**: Use Angular's two-way data binding to manage the state of your components.
   ```typescript
   import { Component } from '@angular/core';

   @Component({
     selector: 'app-root',
     templateUrl: './app.component.html',
     styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
   })
   export class AppComponent {
     name = 'Angular';
     favoriteNumber = 42;
   }
   ```

### Mathematical Models and Formulas & Detailed Explanation & Example Illustrations

#### Data Structures and Algorithms

In building a technology stack, understanding the underlying mathematical models and algorithms is crucial. Let's delve into some core concepts, including data structures and sorting algorithms, and provide examples to illustrate their applications.

#### Data Structures

**1. Linked Lists**

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (or node) contains a pointer to the next element. The main advantage of linked lists is that they can be dynamically allocated, making them efficient for implementing operations like insertion and deletion.

**Mathematical Model:**

- **Length of a Linked List** ($L$): $L = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} \frac{1}{a_i}$, where $a_i$ is the length of the $i$-th node.
- **Sum of Values in a Linked List** ($S$): $S = \sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i$, where $v_i$ is the value of the $i$-th node.

**Example:**

Suppose we have a linked list with three nodes: $[3, 5, 7]$. The length of the list is $L = 1 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{7} = 1.67$, and the sum of the values is $S = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15$.

**2. Binary Trees**

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Binary trees are used for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

**Mathematical Model:**

- **Height of a Binary Tree** ($H$): $H = 1 + \max(H_{left}, H_{right})$, where $H_{left}$ and $H_{right}$ are the heights of the left and right subtrees, respectively.
- **Number of Nodes** ($N$): $N = n_0 + n_1 + n_2 + n_3$, where $n_0, n_1, n_2, n_3$ are the number of nodes in the empty subtree, left subtree with one node, left subtree with two nodes, and right subtree with three nodes, respectively.

**Example:**

Consider a binary tree with the following node counts: $n_0 = 1$, $n_1 = 2$, $n_2 = 4$, $n_3 = 3$. The height of the tree is $H = 1 + \max(1, 4) = 4$, and the total number of nodes is $N = 1 + 2 + 4 + 3 = 10$.

#### Sorting Algorithms

**1. Bubble Sort**

Bubble sort is a simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

**Mathematical Model:**

- **Number of Comparisons** ($C$): $C = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the list.
- **Number of Swaps** ($S$): $S = C - n$.

**Example:**

Consider an array $[5, 3, 8, 4]$. The number of comparisons is $C = \frac{4(4-1)}{2} = 6$, and the number of swaps is $S = 6 - 4 = 2$.

**2. Merge Sort**

Merge sort is an efficient, divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the list into smaller sublists, sorts them, and then merges them back together.

**Mathematical Model:**

- **Number of Comparisons** ($C$): $C = n \log_2 n$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the list.
- **Time Complexity** ($T$): $T = O(n \log_2 n)$.

**Example:**

Consider an array $[5, 3, 8, 4]$. The number of comparisons is $C = 4 \log_2 4 = 4$, and the time complexity is $T = O(4 \log_2 4) = O(4)$.

#### Examples of Applications

**1. Binary Search Tree**

A binary search tree is a binary tree where the left child contains only elements less than the parent, and the right child contains only elements greater than the parent. This allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

**Example:**

Consider a binary search tree with the following elements: $[3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8]$. To search for the value $5$, we compare it with the root node. Since $5$ is greater than $3$, we move to the right child and compare with the next node. This process continues until we find the value or reach a leaf node. The search involves $3$ comparisons.

**2. Hash Tables**

Hash tables are data structures that use a hash function to map keys to values. This allows for efficient retrieval and storage of data.

**Example:**

Consider a hash table with a hash function that sums the ASCII values of the characters in the key and takes the modulus of the table size. The table size is $10$. The key "apple" has an ASCII sum of $532$. The hash value is $532 \mod 10 = 2$. The value associated with the key "apple" is stored at index $2$ in the hash table.

By understanding these mathematical models and algorithms, developers can build efficient and scalable technology stacks. These principles are foundational to many of the tools and frameworks discussed in previous sections, and they provide the basis for optimizing performance and reliability.

from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///blog.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class Post(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    content = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=False)

@app.route('/posts', methods=['GET'])
def get_posts():
    posts = Post.query.all()
    return jsonify([{'id': post.id, 'title': post.title, 'content': post.content} for post in posts])

@app.route('/posts', methods=['POST'])
def create_post():
    data = request.get_json()
    new_post = Post(title=data['title'], content=data['content'])
    db.session.add(new_post)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify({'message': 'Post created successfully.'})

@app.route('/posts/<int:post_id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_post(post_id):
    post = Post.query.get_or_404(post_id)
    return jsonify({'id': post.id, 'title': post.title, 'content': post.content})

@app.route('/posts/<int:post_id>', methods=['PUT'])
def update_post(post_id):
    post = Post.query.get_or_404(post_id)
    data = request.get_json()
    post.title = data['title']
    post.content = data['content']
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify({'message': 'Post updated successfully.'})

@app.route('/posts/<int:post_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_post(post_id):
    post = Post.query.get_or_404(post_id)
    db.session.delete(post)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify({'message': 'Post deleted successfully.'})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    db.create_all()
    app.run(debug=True)
```

#### Containerization with Docker

**1. Create a Dockerfile**

In the `back-end` folder, create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the Flask application.

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

**2. Build the Docker Image**

Build the Docker image from the `Dockerfile`.

```bash
docker build -t my-blog-platform-back-end .
```

**3. Run the Docker Container**

Run the Docker container and map the port to the host machine.

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 my-blog-platform-back-end
```

#### Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions

**1. Create a GitHub Repository**

Create a new GitHub repository for the blog platform and add a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file to define the CI/CD pipeline.

```yaml
name: CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Run tests
      run: python -m unittest discover

    - name: Build Docker Image
      uses: docker-actions/docker-action@v1
      with:
        command: build
        args: "--tag my-blog-platform-back-end"
        context: .
        dockerfile: back-end/Dockerfile

    - name: Run Docker Container
      uses: docker-actions/docker-action@v1
      with:
        command: run
        args: "-d -p 5000:5000 my-blog-platform-back-end"
        image: "my-blog-platform-back-end"
```

#### Detailed Explanation

**1. Flask Application**

The Flask application defines routes for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting blog posts. It uses the SQLAlchemy ORM to interact with the SQLite database. The application exposes RESTful APIs for front-end consumption.

**2. Vue.js Components**

The Vue.js components handle the presentation layer of the blog platform. The `Home.vue` component fetches and displays the list of blog posts, the `PostForm.vue` component provides a form for creating and editing blog posts, and the `PostDetail.vue` component displays the details of a specific blog post.

**3. Dockerfile**

The Dockerfile containerizes the Flask application by specifying the base image, working directory, and command to run the application. The `EXPOSE` directive exposes the application port for communication.

**4. GitHub Actions**

GitHub Actions automates the building, testing, and deployment of the blog platform. The CI/CD pipeline runs whenever a commit is pushed to the main branch or a pull request is created. It sets up the Python environment, installs dependencies, runs tests, builds the Docker image, and runs the Docker container.

By following these steps, developers can create a fully functional blog platform using open-source tools and frameworks, demonstrating the practical application of the concepts discussed in this article.
