#### Background Introduction

随着互联网和移动互联网的普及，推荐系统已成为各类应用的关键组成部分。从电子商务平台的商品推荐，到社交媒体平台的个性化内容推送，推荐系统已经深刻影响了人们的生活。传统推荐系统主要基于用户历史行为、内容特征和协同过滤等算法，虽然在一定程度上提高了推荐的准确性和覆盖率，但仍存在一些局限性。例如，传统推荐系统往往缺乏对用户意图和需求的理解，难以在复杂、多变的场景下提供个性化的服务。

近年来，人工智能技术的快速发展，特别是深度学习和自然语言处理技术的突破，为推荐系统带来了新的机遇。大模型（如 ChatGPT）作为一种强大的自然语言处理工具，具有强大的语言理解和生成能力。通过将大模型引入推荐系统，我们可以更好地理解用户的需求和意图，从而提高推荐的精准度和用户体验。

#### In recent years, with the popularization of the Internet and mobile Internet, recommendation systems have become a key component of various applications. From product recommendations on e-commerce platforms to personalized content delivery on social media platforms, recommendation systems have profoundly influenced people's lives.

#### 1.5 Background Introduction

#### With the widespread use of the Internet and mobile Internet, recommendation systems have become an integral part of various applications. From product recommendations on e-commerce platforms to personalized content delivery on social media platforms, recommendation systems have profoundly influenced people's lives. Traditional recommendation systems are based on algorithms such as user historical behavior, content features, and collaborative filtering. Although they have improved the accuracy and coverage of recommendations to some extent, they still have certain limitations. For example, traditional recommendation systems often lack an understanding of user intent and needs, making it difficult to provide personalized services in complex and changing scenarios.

In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, especially deep learning and natural language processing, has brought new opportunities for recommendation systems. Large models (such as ChatGPT) are powerful natural language processing tools that have strong abilities in language understanding and text generation. By introducing large models into recommendation systems, we can better understand user needs and intent, thereby improving the accuracy and user experience of recommendations.

#### 1.1 Basic Principles and Characteristics of Large Models

Large models, also known as pre-trained language models, are trained on a large amount of text data to acquire strong language understanding and text generation capabilities. Large models are typically based on deep neural networks, such as transformers and recurrent neural networks. The following are key basic principles and characteristics:

1. **Pre-training and Fine-tuning**: Large models first undergo pre-training on a large amount of unlabelled text data to learn general language patterns and knowledge. Then, they are fine-tuned on specific tasks to provide accurate results for specific domains and applications.

2. **Large-scale Parameters**: Large models usually have tens or hundreds of billions of parameters, which allows them to capture complex patterns and correlations in text data.

3. **End-to-End Learning**: Large models can learn from input to output in an end-to-end manner, eliminating the need to break down tasks into multiple subtasks. This greatly simplifies the design and training process of models.

4. **Support for Multilingualism**: Large models typically support multiple languages, enabling them to process data in different languages and making their applications more widespread globally.

5. **Strong Language Understanding and Generation Abilities**: Through pre-training, large models acquire strong language understanding and generation capabilities, allowing them to generate high-quality and coherent texts for tasks such as dialogue systems and text generation.

#### 1.2 Applications of Large Models in Recommendation Systems

The applications of large models in recommendation systems mainly involve user understanding and content generation.

1. **User Understanding**: Through large models, we can better understand user intent and needs. For example, when a user searches for products on an e-commerce platform, a large model can analyze the user's input query to understand their true needs and provide more accurate recommendations.

2. **Content Generation**: Large models can generate personalized recommendation content. For example, on social media platforms, large models can generate personalized articles and videos based on the user's interests and historical behavior to attract their attention.

#### 1.3 Advantages and Challenges of Large Models

Large models have the following advantages in recommendation systems:

1. **Improved Recommendation Accuracy**: Large models can better understand user needs and intent, thereby improving the accuracy of recommendations.

2. **Reduced Development Costs**: Large models can learn end-to-end, eliminating the need to break down tasks into multiple subtasks. This simplifies the design and training process of models and reduces development costs.

3. **Support for Multilingualism and Multiscenario**: Large models support multiple languages, enabling them to process data in different languages. This makes their applications more widespread globally.

However, large models also face some challenges:

1. **Data Privacy**: Large models require a large amount of user data for training, and protecting user privacy becomes a major challenge.

2. **Computational Resource Requirements**: Large models typically require significant computational resources and storage space, which can be a challenge for scenarios with limited resources.

3. **Explainability**: The behavior of large models is often nonlinear and complex, making it important to explain the decision-making process and improve their explainability.
