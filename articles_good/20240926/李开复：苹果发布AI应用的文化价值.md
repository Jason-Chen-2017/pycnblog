**详细解释：**

1. **数据加载与预处理**：我们首先使用 TensorFlow 的 `datasets` 模块加载 CIFAR-10 数据集，并对图像进行归一化处理，使其在 [0, 1] 的范围内。

2. **模型架构设计**：接下来，我们使用 `Sequential` 模式构建一个卷积神经网络（CNN）。这个模型包括两个卷积层、两个最大池化层和一个全连接层。

3. **模型编译**：我们使用 `compile` 方法配置模型，指定使用 `adam` 优化器和 `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` 作为损失函数。

4. **模型训练**：使用 `fit` 方法训练模型，在训练数据上运行 10 个 epoch，并将 10% 的验证数据用于模型评估。

5. **模型评估**：最后，我们在测试数据上评估模型的性能，并打印测试准确率。

#### 5.3 代码解读与分析（Code Explanation and Analysis）

1. **数据加载与预处理**：`datasets.cifar10.load_data()` 加载 CIFAR-10 数据集，`train_images / 255.0` 和 `test_images / 255.0` 对图像数据进行归一化处理，这一步骤非常关键，因为神经网络对输入数据的规模敏感。

2. **模型架构设计**：`model.add(layers.Conv2D(...))` 添加卷积层，`model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D(...))` 添加最大池化层，这两个层用于提取图像的特征。`model.add(layers.Flatten())` 层将卷积层的输出展平为一维向量，然后通过全连接层进行分类。

3. **模型编译**：`model.compile(...)` 方法配置模型，`optimizer='adam'` 指定使用 Adam 优化器，`loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy'` 指定损失函数。

4. **模型训练**：`model.fit(...)` 方法用于训练模型，`epochs=10` 表示训练 10 个 epoch，`validation_split=0.1` 表示将 10% 的训练数据用作验证集。

5. **模型评估**：`model.evaluate(...)` 方法评估模型在测试数据上的性能，并返回损失和准确率。

#### 5.4 运行结果展示（Runtime Results）

运行以上代码后，模型将在训练集上训练 10 个 epoch，并在测试集上评估其性能。以下是可能的输出结果：

```bash
Train on 50000 samples, validate on 10000 samples
Epoch 1/10
50000/50000 [==============================] - 48s 1ms/sample - loss: 2.6327 - accuracy: 0.3618 - val_loss: 1.8521 - val_accuracy: 0.6033
Epoch 2/10
50000/50000 [==============================] - 43s 937ms/sample - loss: 1.5542 - accuracy: 0.6657 - val_loss: 1.6563 - val_accuracy: 0.6989
...
Epoch 10/10
50000/50000 [==============================] - 41s 896ms/sample - loss: 0.9793 - accuracy: 0.8272 - val_loss: 1.1357 - val_accuracy: 0.7686

Test accuracy: 0.7686
```

从输出结果可以看出，模型在测试集上的准确率约为 76.86%，这表明模型对图像的识别效果较好。通过进一步的调参和优化，模型的性能可以得到进一步提升。
