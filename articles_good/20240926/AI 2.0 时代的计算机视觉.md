### Background Introduction

The era of AI 2.0 has ushered in a new wave of advancements in computer vision, a field that has seen remarkable progress in recent years. With the advent of deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), computers are now capable of performing complex tasks such as image recognition, object detection, and scene understanding with unprecedented accuracy. This article aims to provide an in-depth overview of computer vision in the AI 2.0 era, highlighting the core algorithms, mathematical models, and practical applications.

### Core Concepts and Connections

#### What is Computer Vision?

Computer vision is a subfield of artificial intelligence that deals with enabling machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world. It involves the development of algorithms and techniques that can process, analyze, and understand digital images and videos.

#### The Role of Deep Learning

Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has become a cornerstone of computer vision. By leveraging neural networks with many layers, deep learning models can automatically learn complex patterns and features from large datasets, allowing them to achieve state-of-the-art performance in various computer vision tasks.

#### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs are a specific type of deep learning model that has proven highly effective for image processing and analysis. They are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images, making them particularly suitable for tasks such as image classification and object detection.

### Core Algorithm Principles and Specific Operational Steps

#### Image Preprocessing

Before feeding an image into a CNN, it often needs to be preprocessed to a standard size and format. This may involve resizing, normalization, and data augmentation techniques.

#### Convolutional Layers

Convolutional layers are responsible for learning spatial features from the input image. They consist of filters (also known as kernels) that slide over the input image, computing dot products between the filter weights and the input pixels. The resulting feature maps are then passed through an activation function, such as ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit).

#### Pooling Layers

Pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, which helps to decrease computational complexity and reduce overfitting. Common pooling operations include max pooling and average pooling.

#### Fully Connected Layers

Fully connected layers connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in the next layer. They are responsible for combining the high-level features extracted by the convolutional and pooling layers to make predictions.

#### Softmax Activation Function

The output layer typically uses a softmax activation function for classification tasks. This function converts the logits (raw scores) into probability distributions over the classes.

### Mathematical Models and Formulas

$$
\text{Convolution}:\quad \text{output}(i,j) = \sum_{x,y} \text{filter}(x,y) \times \text{input}(i-x,j-y)
$$

$$
\text{ReLU}:\quad \text{output}(i,j) = \max(0, \text{input}(i,j))
$$

$$
\text{Pooling}:\quad \text{output}(i,j) = \text{max}(\text{input}(\text{region around }(i,j)))
$$

$$
\text{Fully Connected}:\quad \text{output}(i) = \text{sum}(\text{weight}(i,j) \times \text{input}(j))
$$

$$
\text{Softmax}:\quad P(\text{class}_k) = \frac{e^{\text{logit}_k}}{\sum_{j} e^{\text{logit}_j}}
$$

### Project Practice: Code Examples and Detailed Explanations

# Load the MNIST dataset
mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()

# Preprocess the images
train_images = train_images / 255.0
test_images = test_images / 255.0

# Build the CNN model
model = models.Sequential()
model.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.Flatten())
model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax'))

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=5, batch_size=64)

# Evaluate the model
