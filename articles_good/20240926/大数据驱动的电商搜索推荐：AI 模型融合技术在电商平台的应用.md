## Background Introduction

With the rapid development of the internet and e-commerce, big data technology has become increasingly prevalent in online retail platforms. E-commerce platforms generate massive amounts of user behavior data, product data, and market data every day. This data encompasses user browsing records, search histories, purchase preferences, as well as product prices, sales volumes, and reviews. Extracting valuable insights from these vast amounts of data and providing personalized search recommendations is crucial for the continuous growth of online retail platforms.

E-commerce search and recommendation systems are a critical component of online retail platforms. They analyze user behaviors and product attributes to provide users with highly relevant and satisfying search results and recommended products. An efficient search and recommendation system can enhance user shopping experiences, increase sales, and improve platform competitiveness. However, traditional search and recommendation systems often rely on manually defined rules and simple algorithms, which fail to fully leverage the potential of big data.

In recent years, the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies has brought new opportunities for e-commerce search and recommendation systems. By incorporating deep learning, collaborative filtering, clustering analysis, and other algorithms, big data-driven search and recommendation systems can better understand and predict user behaviors, offering more precise and personalized recommendations. Moreover, the integration of various algorithms and techniques continues to emerge, further improving the performance of recommendation systems.

This article will explore big data-driven e-commerce search and recommendation systems, focusing on AI model fusion techniques. We will first introduce the basic concepts and architecture of e-commerce search and recommendation systems, then analyze the core algorithm principles and mathematical models in detail, and finally demonstrate the application of AI model fusion techniques in online retail platforms through a specific project case study.

### Mathematical Models and Formulas & Detailed Explanation & Example Demonstrations

#### 3.1 Collaborative Filtering

##### 3.1.1 User-Based Collaborative Filtering

User-based collaborative filtering revolves around calculating the similarity between users and generating recommendations based on the similarity matrix.

1. **Similarity Calculation**

Similarity is typically measured using cosine similarity or Pearson correlation coefficient:

\[ \text{Cosine Similarity} = \frac{\text{dot product of } u_i \text{ and } u_j}{\|u_i\|\|u_j\|} \]

\[ \text{Pearson Correlation} = \frac{\sum{(r_{ij} - \bar{r_i})(r_{ij} - \bar{r_j})}}{\sqrt{\sum{(r_{ij} - \bar{r_i})^2} \sum{(r_{ij} - \bar{r_j})^2}}} \]

Where \( u_i \) and \( u_j \) are the feature vectors of users \( i \) and \( j \), \( r_{ij} \) is the rating of user \( i \) on item \( j \), and \( \bar{r_i} \) and \( \bar{r_j} \) are the average ratings of users \( i \) and \( j \), respectively.

2. **Recommendation Generation**

Based on the similarity matrix \( S \), compute the predicted rating \( \hat{r}_{ij} \) for each unrated item \( j \) for user \( i \):

\[ \hat{r}_{ij} = \sum_{k \in N(i)} s_{ik} \cdot r_{kj} \]

Where \( N(i) \) is the set of users similar to user \( i \), and \( \hat{r}_{ij} \) is the predicted rating of user \( i \) on item \( j \).

##### 3.1.2 Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

1. **Item Similarity Calculation**

Using a method similar to user similarity calculation, compute the similarity between items:

\[ \text{Cosine Similarity} = \frac{\text{dot product of } v_i \text{ and } v_j}{\|v_i\|\|v_j\|} \]

Where \( v_i \) and \( v_j \) are the feature vectors of items \( i \) and \( j \).

2. **Recommendation Generation**

Based on the item similarity matrix \( V \), compute recommendations for user \( u \) on unrated items \( j \):

\[ \hat{r}_{ij} = \sum_{k \in \text{History}(u)} v_{ik} \cdot v_{kj} \]

Where \( \text{History}(u) \) is the set of items previously purchased by user \( u \), and \( \hat{r}_{ij} \) is the predicted rating of user \( u \) on item \( j \).

#### 3.2 Matrix Factorization

Matrix factorization is an extension of collaborative filtering that decomposes the user-item rating matrix into low-rank user feature matrix and item feature matrix.

##### 3.2.1 SVD Decomposition

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a common matrix factorization method:

\[ R = U \cdot S \cdot V^T \]

Where \( R \) is the user-item rating matrix, \( U \) and \( V \) are feature matrices, and \( S \) is a diagonal matrix containing singular values.

1. **Feature Matrix Extraction**

Extract the user feature matrix \( U \) and item feature matrix \( V \) from the SVD decomposition:

\[ u_i = U(:, i) \]
\[ v_j = V(:, j) \]

2. **Predict Rating**

Predict the rating of user \( i \) on item \( j \):

\[ \hat{r}_{ij} = u_i^T \cdot v_j = \sum_{k=1}^K u_{ik} \cdot s_k \cdot v_{kj} \]

Where \( s_k \) is the \( k \)-th singular value.

#### 3.3 Deep Learning

In deep learning-based recommendation systems, neural networks are often used to model user and item features.

##### 3.3.1 Neural Network Architecture

A simple neural network architecture includes an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer:

1. **Input Layer**

The input layer receives the feature vectors of users and items.

\[ x = [u; v] \]

2. **Hidden Layer**

The hidden layer transforms the input features through activation functions such as ReLU or Sigmoid.

\[ h = \sigma(W_1 \cdot x + b_1) \]

Where \( \sigma \) is the activation function, \( W_1 \) and \( b_1 \) are weights and biases.

3. **Output Layer**

The output layer predicts the rating of a user on an item.

\[ \hat{r}_{ij} = W_2 \cdot h + b_2 \]

Where \( W_2 \) and \( b_2 \) are weights and biases.

##### 3.3.2 Training Process

The neural network is trained using backpropagation:

1. **Forward Propagation**

Compute the predicted rating from the input layer to the output layer.

\[ \hat{r}_{ij} = \text{activation function}(\text{activation function}(W_2 \cdot \text{activation function}(W_1 \cdot x + b_1) + b_2)) \]

2. **Compute Loss**

Use mean squared error (MSE) to compute the error between the predicted rating and the actual rating.

\[ \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i,j} (\hat{r}_{ij} - r_{ij})^2 \]

3. **Backpropagation**

Update the network weights and biases.

\[ \Delta W_2 = -\alpha \frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial W_2} \]
\[ \Delta b_2 = -\alpha \frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial b_2} \]
\[ \Delta W_1 = -\alpha \frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial W_1} \]
\[ \Delta b_1 = -\alpha \frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial b_1} \]

Where \( \alpha \) is the learning rate.

                    [1, 1, 0, 5],
                    [1, 0, 4, 5]])

# Split the dataset into training and test sets
train_data, test_data = train_test_split(ratings, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Compute user and item similarity matrices
user_similarity = cosine_similarity(train_data, train_data)
