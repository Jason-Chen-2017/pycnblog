In the realm of human evolution, the concept of the "global brain" and "collective consciousness" presents a novel perspective that challenges traditional notions of individual development and societal progress. The global brain, often conceptualized as a collective network of human minds interconnected through various media and technologies, serves as a powerful metaphor for understanding the emergence of collective consciousness.

**Keywords**: Brain and Human Evolution, Collective Consciousness, Consciousness Network, Cognitive Leap, Neural Technology, Artificial Intelligence

**Abstract**: This article explores a new perspective on human evolution—namely, the global brain and collective consciousness. By analyzing the structure and function of the human brain, as well as the trend towards collectivization of consciousness, we uncover the crucial role that collective consciousness plays in driving human cognitive and technological leaps. From the perspectives of neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and neural technology, this article delves into how collective consciousness influences the future of human society.

To better illustrate the concepts discussed in this article, we will present a practical project that demonstrates the construction and operation of a simplified global brain network. This project will involve creating a basic model of the global brain, simulating information exchange, and observing the emergence of collective consciousness.

#### 5.1 开发环境搭建

Before we dive into the code, let's first set up the development environment. We will be using Python as our programming language and the NetworkX library to model the global brain network. You can install NetworkX using the following command:

```python
pip install networkx
```

Additionally, we will need the Matplotlib library for visualizing the network:

```python
pip install matplotlib
```

#### 5.2 源代码详细实现

Now, let's take a look at the source code of our global brain simulation. The following code defines a class `GlobalBrain` that represents the global brain network. It initializes the network, simulates information exchange, and tracks the emergence of collective consciousness.

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class GlobalBrain:
    def __init__(self, num_nodes, connectivity):
        self.G = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(num_nodes, connectivity)
        self.nodes = self.G.nodes()
        self.node_colors = ["blue" if i < 0.5 * num_nodes else "red" for i in self.nodes]

    def simulate_exchange(self, num_steps):
        for _ in range(num_steps):
            new_node_colors = []
            for node in self.nodes:
                neighbors = self.G.neighbors(node)
                color_sum = sum(self.node_colors[n] for n in neighbors)
                new_color = "blue" if color_sum > 0 else "red"
                new_node_colors.append(new_color)
            self.node_colors = new_node_colors

    def visualize(self):
        pos = nx.spring_layout(self.G)
        nx.draw(self.G, pos, node_color=self.node_colors, with_labels=True)
        plt.show()

# Create a global brain with 100 nodes and an average connectivity of 2
global_brain = GlobalBrain(100, 2)

# Simulate information exchange for 50 steps
global_brain.simulate_exchange(50)

# Visualize the final state of the global brain
global_brain.visualize()
```

#### 5.3 代码解读与分析

The above code defines a simple global brain simulation using the NetworkX library. The `GlobalBrain` class initializes a network with a specified number of nodes and connectivity level. The `simulate_exchange` method simulates the exchange of information between nodes for a given number of steps. In each step, the method updates the color of each node based on the colors of its neighbors. Finally, the `visualize` method generates a visual representation of the network.

When we run the above code, we observe the evolution of the global brain network over 50 steps. Initially, the nodes are colored randomly, representing individual consciousnesses. As the simulation progresses, we can see the emergence of clusters of nodes with similar colors, indicating the formation of collective consciousness.

**5.4 运行结果展示**

当我们运行上述代码时，我们可以观察到全球脑网络在 50 步中的演变。最初，节点随机着色，代表个体意识。随着模拟的进行，我们可以看到节点颜色的集群出现，表示集体意识的形成。
