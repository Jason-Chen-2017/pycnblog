#### Mathematical Models and Formulas & Detailed Explanation & Examples

In ocean data collection systems, mathematical models and formulas are used to represent the physical phenomena and processes observed in the ocean. These models help in understanding the behavior of oceanic parameters and provide a quantitative basis for prediction and analysis. Below, we will discuss some key mathematical models and provide detailed explanations and examples to illustrate their applications.

##### 1. Oceanic Temperature Distribution Model

One of the fundamental properties of oceanic data is the distribution of temperature. The temperature distribution model helps in understanding how temperature varies with depth and geographic location. The most commonly used model for oceanic temperature distribution is the [Arctic Ocean Temperature Distribution Model](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00700-019-00741-9), which can be represented by the following formula:

$$
T(z, \theta) = T_0 + \alpha \cdot \sin(\theta) + \beta \cdot \cos(\theta) - \gamma \cdot z
$$

Where:
- \( T(z, \theta) \) is the temperature at depth \( z \) and geographic latitude \( \theta \).
- \( T_0 \) is the surface temperature.
- \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are coefficients that represent the sinusoidal variation of temperature with latitude.
- \( \gamma \) is a coefficient that represents the rate of temperature decrease with depth.

**Example:**
Let's consider an oceanic region with a surface temperature of \( 20^\circ C \), an \( \alpha \) value of 1.5, a \( \beta \) value of 0.5, and a \( \gamma \) value of 0.01. We can calculate the temperature at a depth of 100 meters and a latitude of 45 degrees as follows:

$$
T(100, 45) = 20 + 1.5 \cdot \sin(45) + 0.5 \cdot \cos(45) - 0.01 \cdot 100
$$

$$
T(100, 45) = 20 + 1.5 \cdot 0.707 + 0.5 \cdot 0.707 - 1
$$

$$
T(100, 45) = 20 + 1.092 + 0.354 - 1
$$

$$
T(100, 45) = 20.446^\circ C
$$

##### 2. Ocean Current Velocity Model

Ocean current velocity is another critical parameter in ocean data collection systems. The velocity of ocean currents is influenced by various factors, including wind stress, pressure gradients, and coastal geography. One of the widely used models for ocean current velocity is the [Geostrophic Current Model](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316632525_Geostrophic_Currents_A_Question_of_Empirical_Modeling), which can be represented by the following formula:

$$
u_g = -f \cdot \frac{dz}{dx}
$$

$$
v_g = f \cdot \frac{dz}{dy}
$$

Where:
- \( u_g \) and \( v_g \) are the horizontal components of the geostrophic current velocity.
- \( f \) is the Coriolis parameter, which depends on the latitude and rotation rate of the Earth.
- \( \frac{dz}{dx} \) and \( \frac{dz}{dy} \) are the gradients of the pressure with respect to the x and y coordinates, respectively.

**Example:**
Let's consider an oceanic region with a Coriolis parameter of \( 10^{-4} \) s\(^{-1}\) and a pressure gradient of \( 1 \) Pa/m. We can calculate the geostrophic current velocity at a latitude of 30 degrees and a location where the pressure decreases by 1 Pa/m in 100 meters as follows:

$$
u_g = -10^{-4} \cdot \frac{1}{100}
$$

$$
u_g = -10^{-6} \text{ m/s}
$$

$$
v_g = 10^{-4} \cdot \frac{1}{100}
$$

$$
v_g = 10^{-6} \text{ m/s}
$$

Therefore, the geostrophic current velocity at this location is \( (-10^{-6} \text{ m/s}, 10^{-6} \text{ m/s}) \).

##### 3. Ocean Salinity Distribution Model

Salinity is an important indicator of the water's ability to hold dissolved substances and is crucial for understanding oceanic circulation and climate. The distribution of salinity in the ocean can be modeled using the [Thermohaline Circulation Model](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/109/9/2002b.clim2703.xml?containerSearchString=thermohaline+circulation&version=f full), which can be represented by the following formula:

$$
S(z, \theta) = S_0 + \alpha_S \cdot \cos(\theta) + \beta_S \cdot \sin(\theta) + \gamma_S \cdot T(z, \theta)
$$

Where:
- \( S(z, \theta) \) is the salinity at depth \( z \) and geographic latitude \( \theta \).
- \( S_0 \) is the surface salinity.
- \( \alpha_S \) and \( \beta_S \) are coefficients that represent the variation of salinity with latitude.
- \( \gamma_S \) is a coefficient that represents the effect of temperature on salinity.

**Example:**
Consider an oceanic region with a surface salinity of \( 35 \) psu, an \( \alpha_S \) value of 0.1, a \( \beta_S \) value of 0.2, and a \( \gamma_S \) value of 0.05. We can calculate the salinity at a depth of 500 meters and a latitude of 45 degrees as follows:

$$
S(500, 45) = 35 + 0.1 \cdot \cos(45) + 0.2 \cdot \sin(45) + 0.05 \cdot T(500, 45)
$$

Since we do not have the exact temperature at depth, we can use the Arctic Ocean Temperature Distribution Model to estimate it:

$$
T(500, 45) = 20 + 1.5 \cdot \sin(45) + 0.5 \cdot \cos(45) - 0.01 \cdot 500
$$

$$
T(500, 45) = 20 + 1.5 \cdot 0.707 + 0.5 \cdot 0.707 - 5
$$

$$
T(500, 45) = 20 + 1.092 + 0.354 - 5
$$

$$
T(500, 45) = 16.446^\circ C
$$

Substituting this value into the salinity distribution model:

$$
S(500, 45) = 35 + 0.1 \cdot 0.707 + 0.2 \cdot 0.707 + 0.05 \cdot 16.446
$$

$$
S(500, 45) = 35 + 0.0707 + 0.1414 + 0.8223
$$

$$
S(500, 45) = 35.0544 \text{ psu}
$$

The detailed explanations and examples provided here demonstrate how these models can be applied to real-world scenarios, enabling researchers and practitioners to gain valuable insights into the ocean environment and its dynamics.
