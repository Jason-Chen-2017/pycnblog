# 1.背景介绍



“Concurrency is not parallelism” has always been the mantra in computer science circles for decades and it hasn’t changed much since then. In fact, one of the most commonly used term in concurrent programming is "parallelism" which refers to dividing a task into smaller pieces and executing them simultaneously on multiple processors or threads to improve performance. However, this definition is somewhat misleading as the reality is more complicated with many different approaches, techniques, and tools available to optimize concurrency, including multi-threading, multiprocessing, distributed computing, and cloud computing. Nevertheless, today's modern systems are expected to have more cores than ever before and increasing demands for high concurrency levels necessitate knowledge about how to develop efficient concurrent programs that can take advantage of these resources efficiently. 

In this tutorial we will explore some core concepts and principles related to concurrency in Java using a hands-on approach by implementing several real-world examples. We assume readers to be familiar with basic syntax, data structures, control flow constructs, exceptions handling, and object-oriented programming. At the end of each chapter you'll find exercises to help you practice what you've learned. This tutorial aims at providing an overview of important topics in Java concurrency, such as synchronization mechanisms, thread pools, blocking queue, locks, semaphores, etc., while also covering advanced topics like wait/notify and CAS operations. The book assumes no prior experience with Java programming but provides clear explanations and code examples alongside proofs where necessary. You should be able to use this tutorial as a starting point for your own research on Java concurrency and apply it successfully in your daily work.

## Introduction

Before getting started with learning Java concurrency, let's first understand its history and terminology. 

### History

The first known implementation of concurrent programming was the development of FORTRAN in the 70s, followed by the Simula system from Bell Labs in the early 90s. These languages were developed to support concurrent programming paradigms where multiple processes execute independently on shared resources (i.e., memory) without interfering with each other. Concurrent programming exploded in popularity during the 1990s when various platforms offered native support for multithreading applications. Over time, new terms were introduced such as concurrent processing, parallel processing, and distributed computing, all referring to similar ideas but applying them in different contexts. 

One of the main differences between concurrent and parallel programming lies in their focus: concurrent programming focuses on managing access to shared resources among tasks, whereas parallel programming parallelizes computations across multiple processors or devices. For example, running the same algorithm on multiple threads typically improves execution speed due to increased utilization of processor resources, while performing the same computation on separate processors allows better usage of available resources. Contrastingly, running the same program on multiple computers in a network is considered parallel programming rather than concurrent programming.  

In recent years, multi-core processors have become commonplace and offer significant advantages over traditional single-threaded models. Despite their benefits, however, writing concurrent programs remains challenging even for experienced developers. Without appropriate tools and libraries, errors can easily occur and debugging can be a nightmare. This has led to the rise of frameworks such as Java threading APIs, Golang channels, Node.js event loop, Rust futures, etc., that provide higher level abstractions and ease the burden of writing complex concurrent programs. Today, multi-core processors are becoming more prevalent and hardware vendors are investing in technologies such as HyperThreading and SMT, both of which enable better utilization of CPU resources and reduce context switching overhead.

Another aspect of concurrent programming is resource management. A critical issue in any concurrent application is ensuring proper synchronization between threads to avoid race conditions and deadlocks. Traditional synchronization primitives such as locks, monitors, and barriers come with their own set of drawbacks, making them less suitable for general-purpose use cases. Modern programming languages such as Java and.NET offer improved features such as closures, actors, promises, and async/await patterns that allow users to write highly concurrent and resilient software.

However, while the concepts behind concurrency are well understood and intuitive, implementing them correctly requires attention to detail and careful planning. It's essential to choose appropriate synchronization strategies based on the characteristics of the problem being solved and to identify potential bottlenecks and deadlocks. Additionally, it's crucial to ensure scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance. With these challenges in mind, here are some key concepts and principles related to Java concurrency.


## Synchronization Mechanisms

Synchronization is the process of controlling access to shared resources among concurrent threads. In Java, there are three main types of synchronization mechanisms - **monitor**, **volatile variables**, and **atomic classes**. Let's discuss each of these in detail. 


### Monitors

A monitor is essentially a construct that enforces mutual exclusion among threads accessing shared resources. When a thread wants to enter a synchronized block of code, it must acquire the corresponding lock associated with the monitor. Once the thread has acquired the lock, only other threads waiting on the lock may proceed. Similarly, if another thread releases the lock, waiting threads are notified and allowed to acquire the lock. 

Here's an example of using a monitor in Java:

```java
class BankAccount {
    private int balance = 0;
    
    public void deposit(int amount) {
        synchronized(this) {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }

    public void withdraw(int amount) throws InsufficientFundsException {
        synchronized(this) {
            if (balance < amount)
                throw new InsufficientFundsException("Insufficient funds");
            
            balance -= amount;
        }
    }

    // getters and setters omitted...
}
```

In this example, `deposit` and `withdraw` methods are marked as synchronized so that only one thread can execute them at a time. When either method is called, it enters the locked region and waits until the lock becomes available. The lock is released automatically when the synchronized block exits. 

As mentioned earlier, monitors enforce mutual exclusion and prevent deadlocks. However, they come with additional costs such as reduced throughput, higher latency, and additional memory consumption compared to other synchronization mechanisms. Therefore, they should be used sparingly and relegated to low-level drivers and frameworks. Use atomic operations instead whenever possible. 

### Volatile Variables

A volatile variable is declared with the keyword `volatile`, indicating that reads and writes to it are done atomically. Unlike regular variables, volatile variables are cached in memory, allowing multiple threads to read and modify them concurrently. Any change made to a volatile variable by one thread is immediately visible to all other threads. Here's an example:

```java
public class Counter {
    private volatile int count = 0;

    public void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

In this example, `count` is declared as volatile to ensure visibility of updates to the counter value among multiple threads. Multiple threads can safely call the `increment` method and read the current value of `count`. This makes the counter safe for concurrent access. Note that volatile variables do not impose mutual exclusion, meaning multiple threads could still read or update a volatile variable concurrently. Avoid relying solely on volatile variables for synchronization unless absolutely necessary. They introduce unnecessary overhead and make debugging harder.

### Atomic Classes

An atomic class is a collection of methods designed to perform atomic operations on shared state. One way to achieve atomicity is through the use of compare-and-set (CAS) operations, which check whether the current value matches a given reference and, if yes, replace it with a new value atomically. An atomic class can be implemented as follows:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.*;

class AtomicIntegerArray {
    private final AtomicInteger[] array;

    public AtomicIntegerArray(int length) {
        array = new AtomicInteger[length];
        for (int i=0; i<array.length; i++) {
            array[i] = new AtomicInteger();
        }
    }

    public void addAndGet(int index, int delta) {
        while (!compareAndSet(index, array[index].get(), array[index].get()+delta)) {}
    }

    private boolean compareAndSet(int index, int expect, int update) {
        return array[index].compareAndSet(expect, update);
    }
}
```

In this example, `AtomicIntegerArray` uses two arrays of type `AtomicInteger` to implement atomic operations on an integer array. Each element of the array corresponds to an instance variable of `AtomicIntegerArray`. To add a value to an element, the `addAndGet` method calls `compareAndSet` repeatedly until the result indicates success. This ensures that only one thread modifies the variable at a particular index at once, ensuring atomicity. Compare-and-set operations are generally faster than locking and unlocking synchronized blocks and require fewer instructions, reducing contention and improving performance. 

Note that atomic classes don't necessarily guarantee strong consistency and may lose updates in case of failures. Careful consideration should be taken to determine the correct tradeoffs when designing concurrent algorithms. Additionally, certain built-in classes in Java such as ArrayList, HashMap, etc., are already implemented as atomic classes and can be used directly as shared state without having to create custom implementations. 

## Thread Pools

Thread pools are a powerful tool for optimizing resource usage in concurrent programs. Instead of creating and destroying threads frequently, thread pools maintain a pool of idle threads ready to accept new jobs. This reduces the overhead involved in creating and destroying threads, resulting in significant reduction in runtime and energy consumption. There are several ways to create and manage thread pools in Java, ranging from simple fixed size pools to more complex dynamically resized pools that adjust based on workload. Here's an example of creating a fixed size thread pool:

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
try {
  Future<String> future1 = executor.submit(() -> expensiveOperation());
  Future<String> future2 = executor.submit(() -> expensiveOperation2());

  String result1 = future1.get();
  String result2 = future2.get();
  System.out.println("Result 1: "+result1+", Result 2: "+result2);
} finally {
  executor.shutdown();
}
```

In this example, `executor` is a fixed size thread pool consisting of four worker threads. Two `expensiveOperation` tasks are submitted to the pool and stored in `Future` objects. The results are retrieved by calling the `get()` method on each future object, which blocks until the task completes and returns the result. Finally, `executor` is shut down to release resources.

Dynamically resized thread pools can be created using techniques such as smooth decay of thread counts according to load, sliding window scheduling policy, etc. Dynamic thread pool sizes can significantly reduce tail latencies and increase overall efficiency, particularly in scenarios with varying workload. However, care must be taken to ensure that the dynamic nature of the pool doesn't adversely affect performance.

## Blocking Queues

Blocking queues are data structures that provide a mechanism for coordination between threads. They act as buffers between threads and producer threads put elements onto the queue while consumer threads remove elements from the queue. Different types of blocking queues exist depending on the specific requirements of the application, including unbounded FIFO, bounded FIFO, priority queue, delay queue, etc. Here's an example of using an unbounded FIFO blocking queue:

```java
BlockingQueue<Task> queue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>();

// Add tasks to the queue...

while(!queue.isEmpty()) {
  Task task = queue.poll();
  
  // Process task...
}
```

In this example, `queue` is an unbounded FIFO blocking queue. Tasks are added to the queue using the `put` method, which blocks until space is available in the buffer. The `poll` method removes and retrieves the oldest item in the queue, returning null if the queue is empty. The loop continues until all items have been processed.

Unbounded blocking queues are ideal for scenarios where the number of pending tasks is unknown or potentially unlimited, enabling easy integration with third-party libraries and components. Bounded blocking queues are useful when the number of pending tasks needs to be limited to a specific range, preventing excessive growth and eventually causing the program to run out of resources. Priority blocking queues are useful for scenarios where tasks need to be ordered according to some criteria, such as highest priority first or shortest deadline first. Delayed blocking queues can be used to postpone task submission for a specified duration, ensuring that tasks are completed within a certain timeframe.

## Locks and Semaphores

Locks and semaphores are two synchronization mechanisms provided by the standard library in Java. Both are used to protect shared resources from concurrent access. A lock is a reentrant means of controlling access to a shared resource. A thread can acquire a lock multiple times recursively, up to a configurable limit. While holding a lock, the thread can manipulate shared state protected by the lock without worrying about conflicts caused by other threads. Semaphores, on the other hand, represent a special kind of synchronizer that enables multiple threads to synchronize their activities. They serve as signaling entities that permit or restrict access to a common resource, often represented as a shared resource or a semaphore. Here's an example of using a semaphore:

```java
Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(3);

for(int i=0; i<10; i++) {
  new Thread(() -> {
    try {
      semaphore.acquire();
      // Do something exclusive with the resource
      TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1);
      semaphore.release();
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }).start();
}
```

In this example, `semaphore` is initialized with a capacity of three, representing the maximum number of threads that can hold the semaphore. Ten threads are created, each trying to acquire the semaphore. Only three of these threads actually obtain the semaphore, leading to fairness and thus reducing the chance of a deadlock.

## Wait/Notify

Wait/notify is a primitive mechanism provided by Object class in Java that enables one thread to temporarily cease activity and wait for notification from another thread. A thread can wait on an object using the `wait` method, which causes it to block until it receives notification from another thread. Once awakened, the thread is placed back into the runnable state and can resume normal operation. Here's an example of using wait/notify:

```java
Object obj = new Object();
boolean flag = true;

Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
   while(flag) {
     synchronized(obj) {
       try {
         obj.wait();
       } catch (InterruptedException e) {
          e.printStackTrace();
       }
     }
   }
});

Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
   Thread.currentThread().setName("T2");
   try {
     TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(2);
     notifyAll();
   } catch (InterruptedException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
   }
});

t1.start();
t2.start();

TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(5);
flag = false;
```

In this example, `obj` is initially locked. `t1` creates an infinite loop that waits on `obj` using the `wait` method. Since `obj` is locked, `t1` cannot progress beyond this line. `t2` sleeps for two seconds and issues a `notifyAll` command to wake up all threads currently blocked on `obj`. As soon as `t2` wakes up, `t1` resumes execution and attempts to acquire the lock on `obj`. Since the lock is now free, `t1` leaves the `wait` statement and proceeds with its next iteration. Once `t1` finishes iterating ten times, `flag` is set to false, causing the loop in `t1` to terminate.

This mechanism can be used to coordinate the activities of multiple threads under certain circumstances. However, it should be used carefully and in small doses because it can lead to deadlocks and performance issues. Additionally, the use of explicit synchronization mechanisms can sometimes simplify the code and eliminate the need for the use of wait/notify altogether.
