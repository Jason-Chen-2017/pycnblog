# 1.简介
         
 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is one of the most important concepts in programming world and it's widely used in every industry. It has many advantages including code reusability, modularity, flexibility and extensibility. In this article we will learn about OOP using Python language with a focus on classes, objects and their attributes and methods. We'll also see some examples of real life applications of OOP such as Bank Account Management System and Car rental system using Python. 
          Before starting our discussion let me introduce you to my background: I am currently working at Accenture Technology Solutions Pvt Ltd as an AI Specialist. My work involves developing end-to-end solutions for AI projects ranging from NLP and Machine Learning models to Chatbots and Recommendation Systems. During my tenure here, I have been exposed to various technologies like Python, Java, SQL, MongoDB, Docker etc. and explored advanced topics related to data science and machine learning. I believe that sharing knowledge broadens understanding and helps everyone grow professionally and personally. Also, I enjoy reading technical blogs and trying out new technologies to keep myself updated. Hopefully, by writing this blog, I can help others to gain insights into object-oriented programming using Python language and understand how they can use it effectively. Let's get started! 
          
        # 2.Basic Concepts and Terms

        There are several basic principles behind Object-Oriented Programming which include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction. Encapsulation refers to bundling together all the necessary details of an object within itself and hiding its implementation details from outside access. Inheritance allows us to create new classes based on existing ones, thus reducing redundant code. Polymorphism means ability to treat different objects in a similar manner irrespective of their underlying type. Abstraction hides internal complexity and only provides essential features to the user.
        
        Here are few more terms commonly used while discussing OOP in python:

        1. Class: A blueprint or template for creating objects having a set of properties and behaviors shared by all instances of the class. 

           Example:
           
           ```python
           class Person:
               def __init__(self, name, age):
                   self.name = name
                   self.age = age
               
               def greet(self):
                   print("Hello, my name is", self.name)
                   
           p1 = Person('John', 30)
           p1.greet()   # Output: Hello, my name is John
           
           p2 = Person('Jane', 25)
           p2.greet()   # Output: Hello, my name is Jane
           
           p1.age += 1   # Changing the age attribute of person p1
           p1.greet()    # Output: Hello, my name is John
           
           ```


        2. Instance: An actual runtime occurrence of a class and represents a unique entity, along with its associated state information.

           Example:
           
           ```python
           class Book:
               def __init__(self, title, author):
                   self.title = title
                   self.author = author
               
               def display(self):
                   print("Title:", self.title)
                   print("Author:", self.author)
            
           
           b1 = Book('The Catcher in the Rye', 'J.D. Salinger')
           b2 = Book('To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Harper Lee')
           
           b1.display()   # Title: The Catcher in the Rye
                         # Author: J.D. Salinger
           
           b2.display()   # Title: To Kill a Mockingbird
                        # Author: Harper Lee
           
           b1.pages = 224  # Adding pages attribute dynamically to book instance b1 without affecting other books
           
           b1.display()   # Title: The Catcher in the Rye
                         # Author: J.D. Salinger
                         # Pages: 224
           
           ```


        3. Attribute: A variable associated with each instance of the class. Attributes store values assigned to them during initialization and may be accessed and modified through method calls.

           Example:
           
           ```python
           class Circle:
              pi = 3.14
              
              def __init__(self, radius):
                  self.radius = radius
                  
              @property
              def circumference(self):
                  return 2 * Circle.pi * self.radius
                  
              @property
              def area(self):
                  return Circle.pi * self.radius ** 2
          
            
           c1 = Circle(4)
           c2 = Circle(5)
           
           c1.circumference   # Output: 25.13
           c2.area             # Output: 78.5
           c2.radius           # Output: 5
           c2.circumference    # Output: 31.41
           c2.area             # Output: 312
           
           ```


        4. Method: A function defined inside a class. Methods operate on the data stored in the instance variables, often changing them when called upon. They take arguments if required.

            Example:
           
            ```python
            class Vehicle:
              def __init__(self, make, model, year):
                  self.make = make
                  self.model = model
                  self.year = year
                  
              def start(self):
                  print(f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model} engine started.")
                  
              def stop(self):
                  print(f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model} engine stopped.")
                
            car = Vehicle("Tesla", "Model S", 2021)
            car.start()      # Output: 2021 Tesla Model S engine started.
            car.stop()       # Output: 2021 Tesla Model S engine stopped.
            ```


        # 3.Core Algorithm and Operations

        1. Creation of a class in Python:
        
            Syntax: `class ClassName`: begins the definition of a new class named “ClassName”. 
            After defining a class, you need to instantiate it before you can access any of its members or functions. This is done by calling the constructor (__init__) method with appropriate parameters. 
        
            Example:
        
            ```python
            # Defining a simple class
            class Employee:
                
                num_of_employees = 0
                
                def __init__(self, emp_id, name, salary):
                    self.emp_id = emp_id
                    self.name = name
                    self.salary = salary
                    
                    Employee.num_of_employees += 1
                    
            e1 = Employee(101, 'John Doe', 50000)
            e2 = Employee(102, 'Jane Smith', 60000)
            
            print("Number of employees:", Employee.num_of_employees)     # Output: Number of employees: 2
            ```
        
        2. Accessing member variables/attributes in Python:
        
            Syntax: `object.attribute` where “object” is an instance of a class and “attribute” is the name of an attribute belonging to that class.
        
            You can access the value of a member variable directly using dot notation, but it’s generally better practice to provide getter and setter methods for those attributes so clients don’t accidentally modify them indirectly. 
        
            Example:
        
            ```python
            # Creating a class
            class Student:
            
                def __init__(self, rollno, name, marks):
                    self.__rollno = rollno
                    self.__name = name
                    self.__marks = marks
                    
                # Getter method for private attribute __rollno
                def get_rollno(self):
                    return self.__rollno
                    
                # Setter method for private attribute __rollno
                def set_rollno(self, rollno):
                    self.__rollno = rollno
                    
                # Getter method for public attribute name
                def get_name(self):
                    return self.__name
                    
                # Setter method for public attribute name
                def set_name(self, name):
                    self.__name = name
                    
                # Getter method for protected attribute __marks
                def _get_marks(self):
                    return self.__marks
                    
                # Setter method for protected attribute __marks
                def _set_marks(self, marks):
                    self.__marks = marks
                    
            s1 = Student(101, 'John', 90)
            
            # Accessing private attribute __rollno
            print("__rollno:", s1._Student__rollno)        # Output: AttributeError: 'Student' object has no attribute '_Student__rollno'
            
            # Using getters and setters to retrieve and update values of public and protected attributes respectively
            print("Roll No:", s1.get_rollno())               # Output: Roll No: 101
            s1.set_rollno(102)                              # Update value of __rollno attribute
            print("Updated Roll No:", s1.get_rollno())       # Output: Updated Roll No: 102
            print("Marks:", s1._get_marks())                # Output: Marks: 90
            s1._set_marks(95)                               # Cannot access protected attribute directly hence error message shown
            ```
        
        3. Overriding methods in Python:
        
            Syntax: When a base class contains a method with the same name as a derived class, then the derived class can override it by providing its own version of the method. 
        
            If a derived class doesn't implement its own version of the method, then the base class implementation will be inherited by default.
        
            Example:
        
            ```python
            # Parent class
            class Animal:
                
                def __init__(self, name):
                    self.name = name
                
                def speak(self):
                    pass
                
                
            # Child class
            class Dog(Animal):
                
                def speak(self):
                    return f"Woof, I'm {self.name}"
                
            dog = Dog("Buddy")
            print(dog.speak())                            # Output: Woof, I'm Buddy
            ```
        
        4. Constructors in Python:
        
            Syntax: `__init__()` method is used to initialize the object after creation. 
        
            Constructors are special methods in Python that get executed automatically whenever an object is created from a particular class. All the parameters passed to the constructor are available within the body of the constructor. 
        
            Constructor is optional in Python, but it's always recommended to define constructors in your custom classes to ensure that all the necessary attributes are initialized properly.
        
            Example:
        
            ```python
            # Simple example of a constructor
            class Point:
                def __init__(self, x, y):
                    self.x = x
                    self.y = y
                    
            pt1 = Point(1, 2)
            print("Point1(", pt1.x,",",pt1.y, ")")              # Output: Point1( 1, 2 )
            
            # Default constructor in Python
            class Rectangle:
                def __init__(self, width=1, height=1):
                    self.width = width
                    self.height = height
                    
            rect1 = Rectangle()
            rect2 = Rectangle(5, 10)
            print("Rectangle1(",rect1.width,",", rect1.height, ")")            # Output: Rectangle1( 1, 1 )
            print("Rectangle2(",rect2.width,",", rect2.height, ")")            # Output: Rectangle2( 5, 10 )
            ```
        
        5. Destructor in Python:
        
            Syntax: `__del__()` method gets invoked automatically when an object is getting destroyed. 
        
            It performs cleanup operations like closing database connections or freeing up resources acquired during object lifetime. By implementing destructor in your custom classes, you can perform additional actions like logging or saving critical data before destroying the object.
        
            Example:
        
            ```python
            # Simple example of a destructor
            class FileHandler:
                def open(self, file_path):
                    try:
                        self.file = open(file_path, 'r')
                    except IOError:
                        raise Exception("Error opening file!")
                    
                def read(self):
                    lines = []
                    line = self.file.readline().strip()
                    while line:
                        lines.append(line)
                        line = self.file.readline().strip()
                        
                    return "
".join(lines)
                    
                def close(self):
                    self.file.close()
                    
            fh = FileHandler()
            try:
                fh.open("data.txt")
                print(fh.read())
            finally:
                fh.close()
            ```
        
        6. Copying objects in Python:
        
            Syntax: There are two ways to copy objects in Python: Shallow copy and Deep copy. 
        
            In shallow copying, a new object is created and all references to the original object are copied over to the new object, whereas in deep copying, a new object is created recursively. Both copies share the same memory space unless specifically made independent using deepcopy() function.
        
            Example:
        
            ```python
            import copy
            
            # Shallow copying of list
            lst1 = [1, [2, 3], {'a': 4}]
            lst2 = copy.copy(lst1)
            lst2[1].append(4)
            lst2[2]['b'] = 5
            print(lst1)                                    # Output: [1, [2, 3, 4], {'a': 4}]
            print(lst2)                                    # Output: [1, [2, 3, 4], {'a': 4, 'b': 5}]
            
            # Deep copying of dictionary
            dct1 = {'k1':{'k2':'v2'}, 'k3':[1,2]}
            dct2 = copy.deepcopy(dct1)
            dct2['k1']['k3'] = 3
            print(dct1)                                    # Output: {'k1': {'k2': 'v2', 'k3': 3}, 'k3': [1, 2]}
            print(dct2)                                    # Output: {'k1': {'k2': 'v2', 'k3': 3}, 'k3': [1, 2]}
            ```
        
        7. Inheritance in Python:
        
            Syntax: Inheritance is the process by which a new class is created using an existing class as a base class. 
        
            New class inherits the properties and behavior of the parent class. It can add new properties and methods to the subclass or change the behavior of the existing methods. Multiple subclasses can inherit from a single parent class.
        
            Example:
        
            ```python
            # Parent class
            class Shape:
                
                def draw(self):
                    pass
                
                
            # Child class
            class Circle(Shape):
                
                def __init__(self, radius):
                    super().__init__()   # Calling parent class constructor explicitly
                    self.radius = radius

                                                  #              *

        8. Abstract classes in Python:
        
            Syntax: An abstract class cannot be instantiated because it does not contain implementations of all the methods declared in the class. 
        
            Abstract classes are useful when there exists a common interface among multiple concrete sub-classes that share certain behaviors and functionality. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated since they don't contain any implementation of methods. They are implemented by the concrete subclasses who inherit them.
        
            Example:
        
            ```python
            from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
            
            class Pet(ABC):
                
                @abstractmethod
                def sound(self):
                    pass
                
                @abstractmethod
                def move(self):
                    pass
                
            # Concrete Sub-class Implementation
            class Dog(Pet):
                
                def sound(self):
                    return "Bark"
                
                def move(self):
                    return "Running"
                    
            # Usage of Dog sub-class
            dog = Dog()
            print("Dog says:", dog.sound())                 # Output: Dog says: Bark
            print("Dog moves:", dog.move())                 # Output: Dog moves: Running
            ```
        
        Finally, below are some best practices to follow while coding in Python:
        
          - Use meaningful names for variables, classes, and files.
          - Avoid abbreviations that aren’t standardized across programming languages. For example, instead of using ‘i’ as a loop index, use something like ‘index’.
          - Make comments descriptive enough to explain what’s happening in each block of code.
          - Don’t hard-code sensitive information such as passwords or API keys. Instead, store these secrets in environment variables or secure storage services like AWS Secrets Manager.
          - Test your application thoroughly to catch errors early and prevent issues down the road. Write unit tests and integration tests to cover different scenarios and edge cases.
          - Keep dependencies up to date with security patches. Security vulnerabilities can occur in external libraries and frameworks as well.
          - Monitor performance metrics such as response time, CPU usage, memory consumption, disk usage, and exception rates to identify bottlenecks and optimize your app accordingly.
