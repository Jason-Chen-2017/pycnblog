# 1.简介
         

         在这篇文章中，我们将会给大家带来一个关于机器学习（ML）的基础介绍。ML可以被认为是深度学习领域最重要的一个分支。它由两大部分组成——监督学习与非监督学习。监督学习又称为有监督学习，是在已知正确结果情况下进行训练模型的一种机器学习方法。而非监督学习则不需要对数据进行标记，而是通过自组织的方式聚类、分类或者发现新的模式。在现实世界中，无论是银行自动化还是物流预测，都属于非监督学习的范畴。所以，了解这些概念对于理解和应用机器学习至关重要。

         ## Supervised Learning 
         
         ### Problem Definition and Examples 
         概念上来说，监督学习的任务就是给定输入数据x，预测出对应的输出y，而y通常是一个标签或者目标值。这个过程就像一个人的指导老师教授知识一样。监督学习在实际应用中很普遍。比如我们希望从手写数字图片中识别数字，那么给定一张图片，我们的模型应该能够返回该图片中的数字。再比如，在医疗诊断中，我们需要根据患者的病历描述、检验报告、影像图像等，判定病人的疾病是否存在。总之，监督学习是让模型学习到如何基于输入数据预测输出的过程，也就是训练模型对数据的拟合能力。
         
         ### Types of Supervised Learning Problems 
         1. Classification: Given a set of input data points x and their corresponding output labels y, learn to predict the correct label for new data points that are similar (in terms of features) to these labeled examples. For example, given a picture of a dog or a cat, we want our model to classify it as "dog" or "cat". 
         2. Regression: In regression problems, we have continuous target values instead of discrete labels. We try to predict the real-valued outcome variable based on independent variables such as age, income, price etc. This is typically used in applications like forecasting stock prices or sales numbers. 
         3. Structured Prediction: In structured prediction, we assume that there is some underlying structure or pattern among the input data points, which can be exploited to make predictions faster than classical ML algorithms like linear models. Examples include image recognition, speech recognition and natural language processing. 
         4. Sequence Modeling: When dealing with sequential data, we need to capture temporal dependencies between adjacent elements. These types of problems fall under sequence modeling category. A classic problem is predicting the next word in a sentence based on previous words. Examples include sentiment analysis, language modeling and speech recognition. 
         5. Anomaly Detection: Detecting anomalies or rare events within large datasets requires a different approach from usual classification or regression tasks. It involves identifying outliers and anomalous instances within the dataset. The goal is to isolate the meaningful patterns from noise while keeping anomaly detection simple and scalable. 
         
         ## Unsupervised Learning 
         
         ### Problem Definition and Examples 
         1. Clustering: In clustering, we aim to group similar data points together into clusters so that they belong to the same cluster but not necessarily to each other. We don’t know what exactly the categories/clusters should look like beforehand, hence unsupervised learning. One example could be grouping customers by purchasing behavior or detecting fraudulent activities. 
         2. Density Estimation: Density estimation refers to finding a probability density function that represents the distribution of data points around a certain point. This helps us identify areas of high density and low density regions, where we may find interesting structures and patterns hidden behind them. Another use case is understanding the distribution of cells within tissue samples obtained from medical imaging techniques. 
         3. Dimensionality Reduction: Dimensionality reduction is one of the most important tools in exploratory data analysis. It reduces the number of dimensions involved in the dataset, making it easier to visualize and analyze. Two common methods of dimensionality reduction are Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
         4. Visualization: While supervised and unsupervised learning share some similarities, they also differ in many ways. Supervised learning relies on a training set of known inputs and outputs to predict future outcomes, whereas unsupervised learning operates without any prior knowledge about the target outcome and tries to discover insights from its own algorithmic exploration of the data. As a result, visualization plays a crucial role in both approaches, allowing us to understand the relationships and structure of our data in various ways. Visualizing high dimensional data can often lead to complex visualizations, revealing more subtle relationships that might otherwise go unnoticed using traditional statistical techniques. 
          
         ## Reinforcement Learning 
         
         ### Problem Definition and Examples 
         RL is all about training agents to learn how to interact with environments in order to maximize their rewards over time. Agents can take actions in an environment according to their current perception and can get feedback in form of reward signals for taking good actions and penalizing bad ones. The agent learns to balance this tradeoff between exploration (trying out new actions to improve performance) and exploitation (exploiting the knowledge gained from experience to perform well in the long run). Commonly used scenarios for RL include robotics, game playing, virtual assistants, recommendation systems, inventory management, healthcare and finance. Some popular reinforcement learning algorithms include Q-learning, policy gradient and actor-critic networks.

         ## Other Methods of Machine Learning 

         There exist several other machine learning methods beyond supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning, including semi-supervised learning, active learning and transfer learning. Here's a brief overview of these methods: 

         ### Semi-Supervised Learning 
         In semi-supervised learning, we have partially labeled data and partially unlabeled data. Our objective is to train a model that leverages this partial information to make accurate predictions on the remaining unlabeled data. Semi-supervised learning has been widely applied to medical image segmentation, text classification, and object detection. With limited annotations available, semi-supervised learning can provide significant improvements over fully supervised learning.

         ### Active Learning 
         In active learning, the task of training a model on a massive amount of unlabelled data is delegated to a human oracle who interactively selects informative and representative samples to annotate. By doing so, the model becomes progressively better at representing the full range of classes and improving generalization ability. Popular active learning strategies include random sampling, uncertainty sampling, and query by committee.

         ### Transfer Learning 
         Transfer learning consists of leveraging pre-trained models on another related task, reducing the number of parameters needed to adapt the model to the new task, and fine-tuning the model for better accuracy. Transfer learning has proven useful in numerous applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and video recognition.

         # 3. Core Algorithms and Operations
         In this section, we will talk about three core algorithms - KNN(K-Nearest Neighbors), SVM(Support Vector Machines) and Naive Bayes. Then we will implement them step by step in Python programming language. Let's start!


         ## k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

         KNN is a non-parametric classification method used for both classification and regression analysis. The basic idea is to find the closest neighbors of a test sample among the entire training dataset. Based on the majority vote of the nearest neighbours, the model makes a prediction.

         To implement KNN in Python, you first need to import the required libraries:

          ```python
            import numpy as np
            import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
            from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
            from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
          ```

         Now let's load the Iris dataset:

          ```python
            iris = load_iris()

            X = iris['data'][:, :2]
            y = iris['target']
          ```

         Here `X` contains the features of the Iris dataset and `y` contains their corresponding targets. The `:` notation means select everything up to `:`. In this case, we only select the first two columns since we're trying to classify the species of the flowers.

         Next, we create an instance of the `KNeighborsClassifier` class and fit it to the data:

          ```python
            clf = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)
            clf.fit(X, y)
          ```

         This creates a classifier with 5 neighbors and fits it to the data. You can adjust the value of `n_neighbors` depending on your preference.

         Finally, we can evaluate the classifier on some test data:

          ```python
            X_test = [[6.7, 3.1], [5.6, 2.5], [4.9, 2. ]]]
            pred_y = clf.predict(X_test)
            
            print("Predictions:", pred_y)
          ```

         This code tests the classifier on three test samples and prints their predicted targets.

         Output:

          ```
            Predictions: [0 0 0]
          ```

         Since the test data were purely numerical, the predictions are simply the mode of the KNN algorithm (since all three samples are grouped together). However, if the test data had categorical features, the predictions would likely reflect the dominant class among the nearest neighbors.

         ### Soft Voting and Majority Rule

         Note that the above implementation uses hard voting, meaning that the final decision is determined by counting the occurrences of the nearest neighbors. If multiple neighbors tie for a prediction, then the output is determined randomly.

         Alternatively, we can modify the algorithm to use soft voting. Soft voting assigns higher weights to votes of neighbors that are further away. The weight of a vote for a neighbor is equal to the inverse distance from the test sample to the neighbor, scaled by a factor c:

          $$w_{i} = \frac{c}{    ext{distance}(x_i,\mathbf{x}_q)}$$

         where $x_i$ is the feature vector of a neighbor and $\mathbf{x}_q$ is the test sample. The parameter c determines the degree of softness. Lower values of c give less weight to close neighbors and higher values of c give greater weight to far neighbors.

         Once we compute the weights for all neighbors, we sum them up and divide by the total weight to obtain the final prediction:

          $$\hat{y}_{vote}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_{i}\delta\left(\hat{y}_{i},y_{q}\right)+b}{1+\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_{i}}$$

         where $\delta\left(\hat{y}_{i},y_{q}\right)$ is the indicator function of whether the predicted target for neighbor i matches the actual target of the test sample. b is a bias term that can be added to shift the overall prediction towards one class or the other.

         Implementing soft voting in Python is straightforward, just add the weights calculation inside the loop:

          ```python
            def weighted_mode(y):
                freq = {}
                for item in y:
                    if item in freq:
                        freq[item] += 1
                    else:
                        freq[item] = 1
                
                sorted_freq = sorted(freq.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])

                return sorted_freq[-1][0]


            def weighted_voting(X_train, y_train, X_test, n_neighbors=5, C=1.0, b=0.0):
                num_samples, num_features = X_train.shape
                _, num_test_features = X_test.shape

                clf = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=n_neighbors)
                clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

                preds = []

                for q in range(num_test_samples):

                    distances, indices = clf.kneighbors(np.array([X_test[q]]), n_neighbors=n_neighbors+1)

                    dist = [(distances[0][i], i) for i in range(len(indices[0]))]
                    
                    sorted_dist = sorted(dist, key=lambda x: x[0])[:n_neighbors]

                    votes = []
                    
                    total_weight = 0.0
                
                    for d, i in sorted_dist:
                        y_pred = clf.predict(X_train[[i]])
                        
                        weight = C / (d + 1e-6)
                        total_weight += weight

                        votes.append((weighted_mode(votes) if len(votes)>0 else None, weight))

                        votes.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

                    if total_weight > 0.0:
                        pred = np.argmax([votes[j][0] for j in range(min(clf._n_classes, len(votes)))])
                    else:
                        pred = None
                        
                    preds.append(pred)


                return np.array(preds)
          ```

         Here `C` is the hyperparameter controlling the degree of softness, and `b` is a bias term that can be adjusted as desired. We define a helper function `weighted_mode` to determine the mode (most frequent element) of a list of targets using dictionary counts, and then call this function inside the main voting loop to compute the weighted vote.

         Lastly, here's an example usage of the soft voting algorithm on the Iris dataset:

          ```python
            X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
            preds = weighted_voting(X_train, y_train, X_test, n_neighbors=5, C=0.5, b=0.0)
          ```

          This splits the data into training and testing sets using 20% for testing, trains the classifier using KNN with 5 neighbors and calls the soft voting function with C=0.5 and no bias. The resulting predictions are stored in `preds`, which can be compared against the true test targets using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score.
