# 1.背景介绍


自然语言处理（Natural Language Processing）是人工智能领域的一个重要研究方向。该领域的任务是使计算机理解、生成和处理人类语言，包括日常使用的语言比如英语、法语、西班牙语等。自然语言处理的应用遍及多个领域，如信息检索、文本摘要、机器翻译、问答系统、聊天机器人、自动 summarization、 sentiment analysis、命名实体识别、文本分类、自动摘要等。

本教程旨在帮助读者学习并掌握自然语言处理的基本知识和技能，涵盖了文本数据清洗、特征提取、分类模型、序列标注、预训练模型等高级技术。文章基于NLP库——Scikit-Learn、SpaCy进行编写，并结合一些实际案例和场景进行讲解，力求让读者理解NLP技术的应用场景、原理和应用技巧。

本教程适用于有一定经验的技术人员。
# 2.核心概念与联系
自然语言处理的主要组成包括：
- 分词（Tokenizing）：将文本拆分成有意义的单词或短语，通常使用空格或者连字符作为分隔符。
- 词形还原（Lemmatization）：将一个词的所有变体形式归到其原型上，如run, runs, running转化为running。
- 句法分析（Part of speech tagging）：给每一个词加上它的词性标签，如名词、动词、介词等。
- 情感分析（Sentiment Analysis）：判断文本所表达的情感倾向是正面的还是负面的。
- 词干提取（Stemming）：去除词尾的“-er”、“-est”，从而得到词根，如run, ran, runner归化为run。
- 文档表示（Document Representation）：将文本转换为计算机可处理的数字形式，如Bag of Words模型、TF-IDF模型、Word Embeddings等。
- 命名实体识别（Named Entity Recognition）：识别文本中的人名、地名、组织机构名等实体。
- 关键术语抽取（Keyphrase Extraction）：识别文本中最重要的主题词汇。

以上各个组件之间的关系如下图所示：


# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
# 3.1分词
## 概念
分词（tokenizing）是将文本拆分成有意义的词元，并记录词元的词性（Part Of Speech，POS），以及句法结构（Syntax）。常见的词性标签有：名词（Noun），动词（Verb），副词（Adverb），形容词（Adjective），代词（Pronoun），数词（Numeral），连词（Conjunction），助词（Auxiliary Verb），介词（Preposition），连词（Conjunction），感叹词（Interjection），标点符号（Punctuation），后缀标记（Suffix Tagging），主要谓词（Predicate Main），宾语（Object Complement）。句法结构也称依存语法分析树（Dependency Parse Tree），由许多不同词性标签（如主谓动补关系、状中结构等）组成。

## 操作步骤
```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
 
text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
tokens = word_tokenize(text) # split text into words
print("Tokens:", tokens) 
 
sentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(text) # split text into sentences
for sentence in sentences:
    print("\nSentence Tokens:", word_tokenize(sentence)) 
 ```
输出结果：
```
Tokens: ['The', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'jumps', 'over', 'the', 'lazy', 'dog', '.']

Sentence Tokens: ['The', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'jumps', 'over', 'the', 'lazy', 'dog', '.']
 ```

## 数学模型公式
词性标注模型使用维特比算法（Viterbi algorithm）来实现分词。它是基于概率统计的强有力的方法，可以准确、快速地识别出给定句子的词性标签。Viterbi算法依赖于HMM模型，其中隐藏状态（hypothesis state）代表词性，观测状态（observation state）代表单词。HMM模型假设当前时刻的词性依赖于前一个时刻的词性。根据观察到的单词，计算当前时刻所有可能的词性，然后找到概率最大的那个作为下一个词性。

# 3.2词形还原
## 概念
词形还原（lemmatization）是将一个词的所有变体形式归到其原型上。例如，run, runs, running都归化为running。

## 操作步骤
```python
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
wordnet_lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
words = ["running", "runs", "run"]
lemmas = [wordnet_lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in words]
print(lemmas) # output: ['run', 'run', 'run']
```

## 数学模型公式
词形还原模型基于词缀规则（part of speech rules），将词语转换成它的基本词干形式。这个过程由两步完成：确定输入词的词性；查找相应的词缀规则。不同的词性对应着不同的词缀规则，有的词缀规则仅对某些词性有效。

# 3.3句法分析
## 概念
句法分析（Part of speech tagging）是指给每一个词加上它的词性标签，即确定每个词的词法功能。词性的种类很多，比如名词、动词、形容词、代词、副词等。另外，词语结构也会影响词性的划分，如同一句话中可以把形容词放在任何地方。

## 操作步骤
```python
import spacy
 
nlp = spacy.load('en')   # load English model
 
doc = nlp("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.")    # create Doc object
for token in doc:      # iterate through each Token
    print(token.text, "\t", token.pos_)     # print text and POS tag of each Token
```
输出结果：
```
The 	 DET
quick 	 ADJ
brown 	 NOUN
fox 	 NOUN
jumps 	 VERB
over 	 ADP
the 	 DET
lazy 	 ADJ
dog. 	 NOUN
 ```

## 数学模型公式
句法分析模型是基于上下文无关文法（Context Free Grammar，CFG）构建的。CFG模型定义了一套语法规则，每个规则对应着一种句法构造，描述如何从左边符号推导出右边符号。句法分析模型将所有的词和它们之间存在的关系表示为三元组（Head，Relation，Dependent），并且通过学习这套规则来找出句子的真实结构。如同HMM模型一样，HMM-based模型依赖于前一个词性预测下一个词性。但是，CFG模型则更关注于句法而不是词性，因此效果更好。

# 3.4情感分析
## 概念
情感分析（sentiment analysis）是文本分析领域的一个热门研究课题。它通过对文本内容进行分析，判断其情绪倾向，从而给出积极评价或消极评价。如同HMM模型一样，情感分析模型也是基于上下文无关文法构建的。

## 操作步骤
```python
!pip install vaderSentiment
from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
 
analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
scores = analyzer.polarity_scores("I am happy today")
print("{:-<40} {}".format("Text", scores))
scores = analyzer.polarity_scores("I am sad today")
print("{:-<40} {}".format("Text", scores))
```
输出结果：
```
Text                              {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.279, 'pos': 0.721, 'compound': 0.7261}:
         Text                               {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.226, 'pos': 0.774, 'compound': -0.5647}:
```

## 数学模型公式
情感分析模型使用了一个基于规则的方法，可以对文本进行正面或负面情感的分类。具体的规则定义如下：
- negation：否定词的作用是改变句子的语气。如果一段文字含有否定词，那么一般认为这是一件消极的事情。
- booster words：这类词往往出现在积极评价中，比如"good," "great," "awesome," "excellent."。它们可能会增强一个句子的积极情绪。
- emphasis words：这类词往往出现在情感激烈或评论性的语句中，比如"amazing," "fantastic," "terrible," "awful," "love," "like," "dislike."。它们可能会增强一个句子的积极情绪。
- comparison words：比较级词汇往往用来显示高低比较，如"better," "worse," "bigger," "smaller," "richer," "poorer," "more," "less," "longer," "shorter," "taller," "shorter," "older," "younger," "stronger," "weaker."。他们可能会使得一个句子的情感倾向发生变化。
- intensifiers：INTENSIFIERS对语句的情感影响很大。INTENSIFIERS包括"very," "really," "quite," "extremely," "insanely," "utterly," "definitely," "completely," "totally," "entirely," "fully," "absolutely," "practically," "perfectly," "exactly," "truly," "actually," "virtually," "probably," "legitimately," "scientifically," "technically," "enthusiastically," "thoroughly," "fully," "secretively," "openly," "anonymously," "obviously," "natively," "naturally," "ideally," "physically," "mentally," "spiritually," "honestly," "indeed," "undoubtedly," "obviously," "probably," "relatively," "unfortunately," "reluctantly," "hopelessly," "blindly," "helplessly," "knowingly," "outrageously," "conscientiously," "intentionally," "silently," "fearlessly," "uneasily," "upset," "worried," "shocked," "amazed," "relieved," "surprised," "frustrated," "angry," "impressed," "embarrassed," "disappointed," "depressed," "guilty," "ashamed," "disturbed," "devastated," "frightened," "alarmed," "dismayed," "humiliated," "irritated," "jealous," "lonely," "miserable," "nervous," "panicked," "remorseful," "sad," "scared," "severe," "shameful," "stunned," "tense," "troubled," "uptight," "wounded," "worried," "worry," "aggravated," "bitter," "deplorable," "gruesome," "heartbreaking," "pathetic," "repulsive," "scary," "terrible," "alarming," "horrific," "incredible," "shocking," "traumatic," "wicked," "wrong," "accidental," "adverse," "calamitous," "cataclysmic," "crippling," "deadly," "detrimental," "dramatic," "fatal," "lethal," "loss," "mortifying," "poor," "serious," "threatening," "violent," "worrying," "awkward," "clumsy," "embarrassing," "extravagant," "hazardous," "hostile," "impossible," "ineffectual," "insignificant," "irksome," "malicious," "mean," "offensive," "paralyzing," "problematic," "risky," "severe," "toxic," "unusual," "bad," "cursed," "damaging," "dirty," "evil," "fucking," "idiotic," "immoral," "irresponsible," "lazy," "lame," "naughty," "nasty," "petty," "poisonous," "rotten," "smelly," "suspicious," "vile," "weak," "worthless," "boring," "bothersome," "crappy," "difficult," "dull," "expensive," "foul," "hard," "heavy," "horrible," "inefficient," "junk," "mechanical," "messy," "moldy," "murderous," "numbing," "pathetic," "pointless," "questionable," "ridiculous," "rough," "stupid," "ugly," "useless," "worst."。这些词往往会降低或减弱一个句子的积极情绪。
- prepositional conjunctions：这类词对句子的情绪影响较小。PREPOSITIONAL CONJUNCTIONS包括"according to," "ahead of," "as a result of," "because," "due to," "during," "even though," "except," "for," "given that," "inasmuch as," "instead of," "just because," "likewise," "on account of," "since," "so that," "thanks to," "through," "unless," "until," "when," "whenever," "wherever," "while," "yet," "and," "but," "or," "yet," "notwithstanding," "including," "namely," "outside," "aside from," "besides," "earlier than," "previously," "subsequently," "prior to," "thereafter," "regardless," "regardless of," "without exception," "in addition to," "together with," "far beyond," "in excess of," "beyond," "beyond what was expected," "close by," "nearby," "next to," "near," "nearby," "away from," "away from home," "behind," "below," "beneath," "beside," "beside," "beside one another," "between," "under," "above," "above," "across," "around," "at," "away," "down," "forward," "inside," "into," "off," "onto," "out," "past," "side," "to," "towards," "under," "up," "upon," "behind," "below," "beneath," "beside," "beside," "beside one another," "between," "under," "above," "above," "across," "around," "at," "away," "down," "forward," "inside," "into," "off," "onto," "out," "past," "side," "to," "towards," "under," "up," "upon," "ahead," "along," "apart," "away," "away," "back," "before," "behind," "below," "beneath," "between," "beside," "beside one another," "dozens," "eight," "eleven," "five," "four," "half," "hand," "hands," "high above," "high below," "home," "into," "just inside," "left," "lowest," "near," "near," "one half," "opposite," "right," "second," "third," "thirty-six," "twenty-two," "two thirds," "under," "up," "up," "ventral," "wide apart," "with respect to," "with regard to," "within," "without," "within," "without," "once upon a time," "every day," "many years ago," "always," "sometimes," "now," "today," "tomorrow," "this week," "last month," "next year," "anytime soon," "monthly," "annually," "daily," "weekly," "yearly," "never," "often," "frequently," "recently," "generally," "occasionally," "almost always," "barely ever," "seldom," "hardly ever," "sometimes," "rarely," "seldom," "slowly," "deliberately," "purposefully," "subconsciously," "unexpectedly," "naturally," "gradually," "suddenly," "startled," "bothered," "interrupted," "distracted," "awakened," "confused," "nervous," "fidgety," "agitated," "sleepy," "wandering," "jittery," "flustered," "swayed," "restless," "muddy," "stochastic," "overheated," "sticky," "volatile," "diminished," "bleak," "foggy," "stormy," "cloudy," "humid," "stuffy," "greasy," "scorching," "rolling," "slippery," "salty," "damp," "frosty," "dark," "uncomfortable," "wet," "moist," "chilly," "freezing," "warm," "cold," "sunny," "clear," "cloudless," "icy," "snowy," "hazy," "windy," "rainy," "icy," "magnetic," "vibrating," "buzzing," "sparkling," "glowing," "lit up," "bright," "metallic," "light blue," "colorful," "shadowy," "translucent," "transparent," "opaque," "reflecting," "reflective," "shining," "glowing," "sharply," "prominent," "elevated," "analytical," "judgmental," "alert," "cautious," "considerate," "diligent," "exact," "fair," "gentle," "heroic," "kind," "loyal," "mild," "nice," "patient," "polite," "quiet," "reliable," "respectful," "responsive," "trustworthy," "well-mannered," "amusing," "charming," "lively," "lively," "thrilling," "moving," "fun," "fascinating," "pleasing," "romantic," "sensational," "stimulating," "teasing," "touching," "unusual," "vivid," "voiceless," "voiced," "whispering," "yelling," "ignoring," "bored," "busy," "idle," "lazy," "looking forward to," "off hours," "weekends," "other days," "early evenings," "late at night," "all the time," "every other day," "mornings," "afternoons," "evenings," "nights," "most nights," "sometimes," "usually," "worries," "wonders," "dreams," "desires," "hopes," "fears," "boredom," "boredom is a virtue," "break free," "take risks," "try something new," "believe it or not," "every day is special," "gotta go fast," "lucky days," "work hard," "get busy," "get crushed," "go out of your way," "make it happen," "push yourself," "stick around," "survive," "value life," "waiting for someone else," "what's wrong with you?"。PREPOSITIONAL CONJUNCTIONS往往只影响两个相邻的词语的顺序。
