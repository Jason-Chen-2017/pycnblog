**Mathematical Models and Formulas & Detailed Explanation & Example Illustrations**

To quantitatively analyze the development of new quality productivity, we need to use mathematical models and formulas. The following examples demonstrate the use of these models and formulas.

#### 4.1 Productivity Growth Rate

The productivity growth rate can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
PGR = \frac{GDP_{t}}{GDP_{t-1}} - 1
$$

Where $PGR$ represents the productivity growth rate, $GDP_{t}$ represents the GDP at time $t$, and $GDP_{t-1}$ represents the GDP at time $t-1$.

Example: Suppose that China's GDP in 2020 was $10 trillion, and its GDP in 2021 was $11 trillion. The productivity growth rate can be calculated as:

$$
PGR = \frac{11}{10} - 1 = 0.1
$$

This means that China's productivity growth rate in 2021 was 10%.

#### 4.2 Digitalization Level

The digitalization level can be measured using the following formula:

$$
DL = \frac{DT}{T}
$$

Where $DL$ represents the digitalization level, $DT$ represents the digital technology investment, and $T$ represents the total investment.

Example: Suppose that China's digital technology investment in 2021 was $500 billion, and its total investment was $1000 billion. The digitalization level can be calculated as:

$$
DL = \frac{500}{1000} = 0.5
$$

This means that China's digitalization level in 2021 was 50%.

These algorithms serve as the backbone for analyzing and optimizing productivity, digital transformation, and industry upgrading. The following section provides a detailed explanation of these core algorithms and their application steps.

#### 3.1 Algorithm 1: Productivity Growth Rate Analysis

**Purpose**: The first algorithm focuses on calculating and analyzing the productivity growth rate, which is a critical indicator of economic performance.

**Input**: The algorithm requires historical GDP data, which includes GDP values for consecutive time periods.

**Output**: The algorithm outputs the productivity growth rate for each period.

**Steps**:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather GDP data for consecutive time periods (e.g., years, quarters).
2. **Data Preparation**: Ensure that the data is clean and formatted correctly for analysis.
3. **Calculate Productivity Growth Rate**:
   $$
   PGR_t = \frac{GDP_t}{GDP_{t-1}} - 1
   $$
   Where $PGR_t$ represents the productivity growth rate for period $t$, and $GDP_t$ and $GDP_{t-1}$ represent the GDP values for periods $t$ and $t-1$, respectively.
4. **Analyze Trends**: Plot the productivity growth rate over time to identify trends and patterns.

**Example**:

Consider the following GDP data for two consecutive years:

| Year | GDP (in billions) |
|------|-------------------|
| 2022 | 100               |
| 2023 | 110               |

The productivity growth rate for 2023 can be calculated as:
$$
PGR_{2023} = \frac{110}{100} - 1 = 0.1
$$

This indicates a 10% productivity growth rate for the period from 2022 to 2023.

#### 3.2 Algorithm 2: Digital Transformation Level Assessment

**Purpose**: The second algorithm aims to assess the level of digital transformation within an economy or industry.

**Input**: The algorithm requires data on digital investments, total investments, and other relevant digital indicators.

**Output**: The algorithm outputs the digital transformation level, which is a measure of the extent to which digital technologies have been integrated into economic activities.

**Steps**:

1. **Data Collection**: Collect data on digital investments (e.g., investments in IT infrastructure, digital services, R&D) and total investments.
2. **Data Preparation**: Ensure that the data is clean and formatted correctly for analysis.
3. **Calculate Digital Transformation Level**:
   $$
   DTL = \frac{Digital\ Investment}{Total\ Investment}
   $$
   Where $DTL$ represents the digital transformation level.
4. **Analyze Trends**: Plot the digital transformation level over time to identify trends and patterns.

**Example**:

Consider the following data on digital and total investments:

| Year | Digital Investment (in millions) | Total Investment (in millions) |
|------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 2022 | 50                              | 100                           |
| 2023 | 70                              | 120                           |

The digital transformation level for 2023 can be calculated as:
$$
DTL_{2023} = \frac{70}{120} \approx 0.583
$$

This indicates that approximately 58.3% of the total investments in 2023 were digital investments.

#### 3.3 Algorithm 3: Industry Upgrading Analysis

**Purpose**: The third algorithm analyzes the process of industry upgrading by assessing the relative importance of different sectors in the economy.

**Input**: The algorithm requires sector-specific data on value-added, employment, and productivity.

**Output**: The algorithm outputs a ranking of industries based on their contribution to the economy and their potential for further upgrading.

**Steps**:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather sector-specific data on value-added, employment, and productivity.
2. **Data Preparation**: Ensure that the data is clean and formatted correctly for analysis.
3. **Calculate Industry Scores**:
   $$
   Score_i = \frac{Value\ Added_i}{Productivity_i}
   $$
   Where $Score_i$ represents the score for industry $i$, and $Value\ Added_i$ and $Productivity_i$ represent the value-added and productivity for industry $i$, respectively.
4. **Rank Industries**: Sort the industries based on their scores to identify the most productive and potentially upgradable sectors.

**Example**:

Consider the following data for two industries:

| Industry | Value Added (in billions) | Productivity (in millions) |
|----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| A        | 30                        | 20                        |
| B        | 40                        | 30                        |

The scores for these industries can be calculated as:
$$
Score_A = \frac{30}{20} = 1.5
$$
$$
Score_B = \frac{40}{30} \approx 1.333
$$

Based on these scores, Industry A has a higher potential for upgrading compared to Industry B.

#### 3.4 Algorithm 4: New Quality Productivity Assessment

**Purpose**: The fourth algorithm integrates the findings from the previous algorithms to provide a comprehensive assessment of new quality productivity.

**Input**: The algorithm requires the outputs from the previous algorithms, including productivity growth rates, digital transformation levels, and industry upgrading scores.

**Output**: The algorithm outputs a composite score that represents the level of new quality productivity.

**Steps**:

1. **Data Collection**: Collect the outputs from the previous algorithms.
2. **Data Preparation**: Ensure that the data is clean and formatted correctly for analysis.
3. **Calculate Composite Score**:
   $$
   NQPS = w_1 \times PGR + w_2 \times DTL + w_3 \times \sum{Score_i}
   $$
   Where $NQPS$ represents the new quality productivity score, and $w_1$, $w_2$, and $w_3$ are weights assigned to each component based on their importance.
4. **Analyze Results**: Interpret the composite score to assess the level of new quality productivity and identify areas for improvement.

**Example**:

Assume the following weights and scores:
$$
w_1 = 0.4, \ w_2 = 0.3, \ w_3 = 0.3
$$
$$
PGR = 0.1, \ DTL = 0.583, \ Score_A = 1.5, \ Score_B = 1.333
$$

The new quality productivity score can be calculated as:
$$
NQPS = 0.4 \times 0.1 + 0.3 \times 0.583 + 0.3 \times (1.5 + 1.333) = 0.04 + 0.175 + 0.5 = 0.725
$$

This indicates a new quality productivity score of 72.5%, suggesting that the country has made significant progress but still has room for further improvement.

In conclusion, these core algorithms provide a systematic approach to analyzing and optimizing the development of new quality productivity. By understanding and applying these algorithms, stakeholders can gain valuable insights into the performance of their economies and industries, enabling more informed decision-making and strategic planning.
