## 4. Mathematical Models and Formulas: Detailed Explanation and Examples

### Benefits of International Collaboration in Human Computer Science

The benefits of international collaboration in human computer science can be quantified using various mathematical models and formulas. Here, we present a simplified model to illustrate the impact of collaboration on research outcomes and technological advancements.

### Model Assumptions

- **A1**: The research community consists of N institutions, each with a certain level of resources (Ri) and expertise (Ei).
- **A2**: The collaboration between institutions leads to an increase in the overall research output (O) and technological advancements (T).
- **A3**: The level of collaboration between institutions is measured by the collaboration coefficient (C).

### Model Formulation

The model is based on the following equation:

\[ O = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{R_i \cdot E_i}{C} \]

The equation calculates the average research output per institution, taking into account their individual resources (Ri) and expertise (Ei), and adjusting for the level of collaboration (C).

### Example Calculation

Consider a research community with three institutions (N = 3). The institutions have the following resources and expertise:

- **Institution 1**: Resources (R1) = 100, Expertise (E1) = 80
- **Institution 2**: Resources (R2) = 150, Expertise (E2) = 60
- **Institution 3**: Resources (R3) = 200, Expertise (E3) = 70

If the collaboration coefficient (C) is set to 2, the average research output (O) can be calculated as:

\[ O = \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{100 \cdot 80}{2} + \frac{150 \cdot 60}{2} + \frac{200 \cdot 70}{2} \right) \]

\[ O = \frac{1}{3} \left( 4000 + 4500 + 5600 \right) \]

\[ O = \frac{1}{3} \left( 14100 \right) \]

\[ O = 4700 \]

With a collaboration coefficient of 2, the average research output per institution is 4700.

### Impact of Collaboration on Technological Advancements

The impact of international collaboration on technological advancements can be quantified using the following equation:

\[ T = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{R_i \cdot E_i}{C} + \beta \cdot \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} C_i \]

The equation adds a term (βCi) that represents the impact of collaboration on technological advancements. The parameter β is a constant that determines the relative importance of collaboration in driving technological progress.

### Example Calculation

Using the same example as before, with a collaboration coefficient of 2 and a constant β = 1.5, the total technological advancements (T) can be calculated as:

\[ T = \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{100 \cdot 80}{2} + \frac{150 \cdot 60}{2} + \frac{200 \cdot 70}{2} \right) + 1.5 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \left( 2 + 2 + 2 \right) \]

\[ T = \frac{1}{3} \left( 4000 + 4500 + 5600 \right) + 1.5 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \left( 6 \right) \]

\[ T = \frac{1}{3} \left( 14100 \right) + 1.5 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \left( 6 \right) \]

\[ T = 4700 + 1.5 \cdot 2 \]

\[ T = 4700 + 3 \]

\[ T = 4730 \]

With a collaboration coefficient of 2 and a constant β = 1.5, the total technological advancements are 4730.

### 5.4. Running Results and Discussion

To run the collaborative machine learning project, execute the `main()` function. The code will load and preprocess the datasets from Institution A and Institution B, train a neural network model using the combined dataset, and evaluate its performance on the testing set.

The output will display the test accuracy of the model. This metric provides an indication of the model's performance in classifying images correctly. Higher accuracy values indicate a better-performing model.

To further analyze the results, we can plot the confusion matrix and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. These visualizations provide insights into the model's performance and can help identify areas for improvement.

```python
# Load the testing data
X_test, y_test = load_and_preprocess_data()

# Load the model weights and evaluate it on the testing data
model.load_weights('model_weights.h5')
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the confusion matrix
conf_matrix = tf.math.confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred.round())

# Plot the confusion matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(conf_matrix, annot=True, cmap='Blues')
plt.xlabel('Predicted Labels')
plt.ylabel('True Labels')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()

# Calculate the ROC curve
fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_test, y_pred)

# Plot the ROC curve
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(fpr, tpr, color='darkorange', lw=2, label='ROC curve (area = %0.2f)' % auc(fpr, tpr))
plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color='navy', lw=2, linestyle='--')
plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')
plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')
plt.title('Receiver Operating Characteristic')
plt.legend(loc="lower right")
plt.show()
```

The confusion matrix visualization shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each class. The ROC curve visualization provides insights into the model's ability to distinguish between the positive and negative classes.

By analyzing these results, researchers can identify the model's strengths and weaknesses and explore potential improvements, such as hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, or incorporating additional data sources.
