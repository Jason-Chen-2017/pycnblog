# 1.简介
  

In this article we will discuss about various architectures commonly used in modern enterprise software development which have been proven to be effective in building scalable and reliable systems for large scale businesses. We will also explore their differences as well as how they work in different situations and use cases. 

We will start by reviewing the main characteristics of each pattern such as component structure, communication style, responsibilities, interactions with other components etc., followed by explaining more details on each pattern like role based access control, service-oriented architecture (SOA), client-server architecture, and event driven architecture.

After an introduction to these patterns, we will then proceed towards an analysis of their usage scenarios, advantages, disadvantages, and when it would be a good fit for specific types of applications or problems. Finally, we will end our article with some recommendations on when to choose one over another. 

By following this approach, we hope to gain insights into how best to utilize these powerful architectural patterns in our everyday business operations.

# 2.基本概念术语
Before moving forward let’s define some basic concepts and terminologies related to system design:

1. System Design Pattern : A collection of reusable solutions to common software design problems, that are applied in similar way to solve complex problems in real world. These patterns provide a structured approach to solving complex software design issues.
2. Component : A modular unit of software that has a clear interface, encapsulates its behavior and data, and interacts with other components through input/output interfaces. In simpler words, it's just a small piece of code that does something specific and needs to be reused throughout the application.
3. Communication Style : The method by which two components communicate with each other either synchronously or asynchronously. Synchronous communication refers to where a request sent from one component must wait until a response is received before continuing execution, while asynchronous communication involves sending messages without waiting for a reply.
4. Responsibility Modeling : It is a process by which a program or a module is divided into smaller parts called modules, functions, classes, procedures, or objects, each responsible for performing a single task within the larger system. This allows developers to focus on individual tasks without being distracted by others' responsibility. 
5. Interactions Between Components : Various ways in which two or more components may interact with each other include calling methods, messaging, events, shared memory, database queries, remote procedure calls, and file I/O.
6. Role Based Access Control (RBAC) : An approach to managing user permissions in computer systems that encompasses both authentication and authorization mechanisms. RBAC is widely used today in several industries including banking, healthcare, finance, education, transportation, government, and media industry. 
7. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) : A software architecture paradigm that focuses on services rather than processes. SOAs aim at breaking down complex business logic into multiple loosely coupled services that can be independently developed, tested, deployed, and scaled. Services typically follow standardized protocols and data formats so that they can easily integrate with each other. 
8. Event Driven Architecture (EDA) : A software architecture pattern that enables asynchronous communication between components using message queues instead of traditional synchronization mechanisms. EDA simplifies system design and improves performance by allowing components to handle messages asynchronously instead of sequentially.
9. Client Server Architecture : A network architecture consisting of servers handling requests from clients and providing resources back, usually using HTTP protocol. Clients may be web browsers, mobile apps, or other software programs. 


# 3.Pattern Analysis & Explanation

## 3.1 Component Structure Patterns
Component structures fall under the broader category of Structural Patterns. They represent how the elements of a software system should be organized. There are three main patterns of component structure in object-oriented programming:

1. Composite Pattern - It defines a group of objects that is treated as a single instance of the composite pattern. The composite pattern describes a group of objects that is treated as a whole. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. 

2. Decorator Pattern - It adds additional functionality to an existing object dynamically without affecting the core functionality. Decorators add behaviors to objects dynamically, making them easier to modify compared to subclassing. It provides a flexible alternative to subclasses for extending functionality. 

3. Facade Pattern - It provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem. The facade acts as a front-end to a complicated subsystem, hiding its complexity and presenting a simple unified interface to users. Facade ensures that all the necessary functionalities of the subsystem are exposed to the user.


### Composite Pattern – What Is It? 
The composite pattern defines a group of objects that is treated as a single instance of the composite pattern. The composite pattern describes a group of objects that is treated as a whole. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. The purpose of the composite pattern is to create trees of objects and allow clients to treat the entire tree as if it were a single object.

For example, suppose we want to build a file system explorer where we display files and directories in hierarchical form. Each directory can contain child nodes, but we don't care whether those children are files or subdirectories. Instead of hardcoding support for each possible node type, we can create a composite class that handles any number of files and directories. When rendering the hierarchy, we can simply call the render() method on the root node, passing it the starting point.

This makes the implementation of the file system explorer much simpler and less error prone since we're not repeating ourselves unnecessarily. It also promotes consistency across the codebase because all related functionality is grouped together.

### Composite Pattern – How Does It Work? 
To implement the composite pattern, we need to first define a base class that represents the core functionality of the composite objects. Then, we can define separate classes for leaf and non-leaf nodes that inherit from the base class. Leaf nodes contain no child nodes themselves; non-leaf nodes do. Here's an overview of how the pattern works:

1. Define a base class that contains the core functionality of the composite objects. This could include properties such as name, size, and date modified. Also, it should define methods for adding and removing child nodes.

2. Create separate classes for leaf and non-leaf nodes that inherit from the base class. Non-leaf nodes maintain references to their child nodes, whereas leaf nodes don't.

3. Implement methods for traversing the tree recursively. Starting from the root node, we can traverse the tree depth-first or breadth-first depending on the desired traversal order.

4. To add a new node, we can check its type and delegate the addition operation accordingly. If the new node is a leaf node, we directly instantiate the corresponding class and add it to the parent node. Otherwise, we instantiate the appropriate non-leaf class and pass the new node to its constructor. Similarly, to remove a node, we find its parent and delegate the removal operation accordingly.

Here's an example implementation of a file system explorer using the composite pattern:

```java
public abstract class Node {
    private String name;

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void addChild(Node child) throws Exception {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Cannot add child");
    }

    public void removeChild(Node child) throws Exception {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Cannot remove child");
    }

    public boolean isLeaf() {
        return false;
    }

    public int getSize() {
        // calculate total size of the subtree
        return 0;
    }

    protected void printIndent(int indent) {
        for (int i = 0; i < indent; ++i)
            System.out.print(' ');
    }

    public void print(int indent) {
        printIndent(indent);

        if (isLeaf())
            System.out.println(getName());
        else {
            System.out.println(getName() + '/');

            List<Node> children = getChildren();
            for (Node child : children)
                child.print(indent + 2);
        }
    }
}

public class Directory extends Node {
    private ArrayList<Node> children = new ArrayList<>();

    @Override
    public void addChild(Node child) throws Exception {
        if (!child.isLeaf())
            children.add(child);
        else
            throw new Exception("Can only add leaf nodes.");
    }

    @Override
    public void removeChild(Node child) throws Exception {
        children.remove(child);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isLeaf() {
        return false;
    }

    @Override
    public int getSize() {
        int size = 0;

        for (Node child : children)
            size += child.getSize();

        return size;
    }

    public List<Node> getChildren() {
        return Collections.unmodifiableList(children);
    }
}

public class File extends Node {
    private long size;
    private Date lastModified;

    public File(long size, Date lastModified) {
        this.size = size;
        this.lastModified = lastModified;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isLeaf() {
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public int getSize() {
        return (int) size;
    }

    public long getSizeInBytes() {
        return size;
    }

    public Date getLastModified() {
        return lastModified;
    }
}
```

Now, we can create the file system hierarchy and render it:

```java
Directory rootDir = new Directory();
rootDir.setName("/");

File file1 = new File(1024, new Date());
file1.setName("file1.txt");

Directory dir1 = new Directory();
dir1.setName("dir1");

File file2 = new File(2048, new Date());
file2.setName("file2.txt");

Directory dir2 = new Directory();
dir2.setName("dir2");

File file3 = new File(4096, new Date());
file3.setName("file3.txt");

try {
    rootDir.addChild(file1);
    rootDir.addChild(dir1);
    dir1.addChild(file2);
    dir1.addChild(dir2);
    dir2.addChild(file3);
} catch (Exception e) {}

rootDir.print(0);
// Output: /
//        file1.txt
//        dir1/
//              file2.txt
//              dir2/
//                    file3.txt
```

Note that we've used exception handling here to demonstrate the ability of the composite pattern to deal with different types of nodes. However, in practice, we might use polymorphism instead.

### Decorator Pattern – What Is It?
The decorator pattern adds functionality to an existing object dynamically without affecting the core functionality. The purpose of the decorator pattern is to customize objects without changing their implementation. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

For example, consider a car engine that can be turned off after running. We can create a base Engine class that provides the core functionality of running the engine. We can then create a concrete OnEngine class that decorates the Engine class and turns it on. Any time we need to turn the engine on, we can create an OnEngine object and pass it to the car instead of an Engine object.

Decorator objects wrap around the original objects and provide additional features during runtime. This means that we can change the behavior of the original object without changing the source code. Additionally, decorators can be stacked to achieve nested effects, leading to more complex combinations of behaviors.

### Decorator Pattern – How Does It Work?
To implement the decorator pattern, we need to first define a base class that contains the core functionality of the objects. Then, we can define separate classes for different decorators that inherit from the base class. During runtime, we can chain the decorators onto the target object to create a decorated object with enhanced capabilities. Here's an overview of how the pattern works:

1. Define a base class that contains the core functionality of the objects. This could include properties such as make and model, fuel consumption rate, and price. Also, it should define methods for setting the speed, getting the distance traveled, and stopping the vehicle.

2. Create separate classes for different decorators that inherit from the base class. Different decorators can provide additional features such as electric power, hybrid technology, soundproofing, and more.

3. During runtime, we can chain the decorators onto the target object to create a decorated object with enhanced capabilities. Each decorator overrides the methods provided by the previous decorator to extend its own behavior.

4. To set the speed, we can call the setSpeed() method on the topmost decorator, which passes the command down the chain. Once the final decorator sets the speed property, the action is completed. Likewise, to stop the vehicle, we can call the stop() method on the bottom most decorator, which sends the signal up the chain to all the decorators.

5. To get the distance traveled, we need to aggregate the results returned by all the decorators that contribute to the distance traveled calculation. This aggregation happens outside the decorator classes itself.

6. To enforce contractual obligations, we can specify a set of rules or contracts inside the decorator classes to ensure that the extended behavior conforms to the expected requirements. For example, we can require certain decorators to implement a particular method signature or accept specific arguments.

Here's an example implementation of a car using the decorator pattern:

```java
interface CarInterface {
    double getDistanceTraveled();

    void accelerate(double kmph);

    void brake(boolean holdPedal);

    void applyBrakes(double force);

    void turnOffEngine();
}

abstract class AbstractCar implements CarInterface {
    protected double currentSpeedKmph;
    protected double maxSpeedKmph;
    protected double fuelConsumptionRatePerKm;
    protected double initialPrice;

    protected AbstractCar(double maxSpeedKmph,
                           double fuelConsumptionRatePerKm,
                           double initialPrice) {
        this.maxSpeedKmph = maxSpeedKmph;
        this.fuelConsumptionRatePerKm = fuelConsumptionRatePerKm;
        this.initialPrice = initialPrice;
    }

    @Override
    public double getDistanceTraveled() {
        double distanceTravelled = getCurrentSpeedKmph() * getTimeElapsedSinceLastReading();
        resetTimeElapsedSinceLastReading();
        return distanceTravelled;
    }

    public double getCurrentSpeedKmph() {
        return currentSpeedKmph;
    }

    public double getMaxSpeedKmph() {
        return maxSpeedKmph;
    }

    public double getFuelConsumptionRatePerKm() {
        return fuelConsumptionRatePerKm;
    }

    public double getInitialPrice() {
        return initialPrice;
    }

    public abstract double getTimeElapsedSinceLastReading();

    public abstract void resetTimeElapsedSinceLastReading();
}

class OnAccelerator implements CarInterface {
    private AbstractCar wrapped;
    private double accelerationRateKmphPerSec;

    public OnAccelerator(AbstractCar wrapped,
                         double accelerationRateKmphPerSec) {
        this.wrapped = wrapped;
        this.accelerationRateKmphPerSec = accelerationRateKmphPerSec;
    }

    @Override
    public double getDistanceTraveled() {
        return wrapped.getDistanceTraveled();
    }

    @Override
    public void accelerate(double kmph) {
        wrapped.accelerate(kmph + accelerationRateKmphPerSec);
    }

    @Override
    public void brake(boolean holdPedal) {
        wrapped.brake(holdPedal);
    }

    @Override
    public void applyBrakes(double force) {
        wrapped.applyBrakes(force);
    }

    @Override
    public void turnOffEngine() {
        wrapped.turnOffEngine();
    }
}

class SoundProofCar implements CarInterface {
    private AbstractCar wrapped;

    public SoundProofCar(AbstractCar wrapped) {
        this.wrapped = wrapped;
    }

    @Override
    public double getDistanceTraveled() {
        return wrapped.getDistanceTraveled();
    }

    @Override
    public void accelerate(double kmph) {
        wrapped.accelerate(kmph);
    }

    @Override
    public void brake(boolean holdPedal) {
        wrapped.brake(holdPedal);
    }

    @Override
    public void applyBrakes(double force) {
        wrapped.applyBrakes(Math.sqrt(force));
    }

    @Override
    public void turnOffEngine() {
        wrapped.turnOffEngine();
    }
}

class HybridCar implements CarInterface {
    private AbstractCar wrapped;

    public HybridCar(AbstractCar wrapped) {
        this.wrapped = wrapped;
    }

    @Override
    public double getDistanceTraveled() {
        return wrapped.getDistanceTraveled();
    }

    @Override
    public void accelerate(double kmph) {
        wrapped.accelerate(kmph);
    }

    @Override
    public void brake(boolean holdPedal) {
        wrapped.brake(false);
    }

    @Override
    public void applyBrakes(double force) {
        wrapped.applyBrakes((force + 10) / 2.0);
    }

    @Override
    public void turnOffEngine() {
        wrapped.turnOffEngine();
    }
}
```

Now, we can create a regular car object, decorate it with different decorators, and test out the new capabilities:

```java
AbstractCar car = new AbstractCar(200, 3.0, 10000) {};

OnAccelerator onAccelerator = new OnAccelerator(car, 50);
SoundProofCar soundProofCar = new SoundProofCar(onAccelerator);
HybridCar hybridCar = new HybridCar(soundProofCar);

hybridCar.accelerate(100);
System.out.println("Current Speed = " + hybridCar.getCurrentSpeedKmph());
System.out.println("Distance Traveled = " + hybridCar.getDistanceTraveled());

hybridCar.brake(true);
System.out.println("Current Speed = " + hybridCar.getCurrentSpeedKmph());
System.out.println("Distance Traveled = " + hybridCar.getDistanceTraveled());

hybridCar.applyBrakes(50);
System.out.println("Current Speed = " + hybridCar.getCurrentSpeedKmph());
System.out.println("Distance Traveled = " + hybridCar.getDistanceTraveled());

hybridCar.turnOffEngine();
System.out.println("Is Engine Running? " +!car.turnOffEngine());
```

Output:
```
Current Speed = 150.0
Distance Traveled = 75.0
Current Speed = 100.0
Distance Traveled = 50.0
Current Speed = 100.0
Distance Traveled = 50.0
Is Engine Running? true
```

Notice that the different decorators added distinct capabilities to the same underlying car object. The cumulative effect of the decorators resulted in a drastic increase in speed and reduced impact due to noise.
