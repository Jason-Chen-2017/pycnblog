# 1.简介
  

Backpropagation is one of the most popular algorithms used for training neural networks. It belongs to a family of gradient-based optimization methods that use calculus to approximate the gradients of loss functions with respect to network parameters and update them iteratively to minimize the error of the model's output while making it more accurate at each iteration. The purpose of this article is to provide an introduction and explanation of backpropagation algorithm for beginners by walking through a concrete example using Python and NumPy libraries. 

In general, backpropagation involves computing the partial derivatives of the cost function (also called the loss) with respect to every weight and bias term in the network architecture, then updating those values iteratively towards minimizing the overall error of the model. The main goal behind backpropagation is to adjust the weights and biases of the neurons in the network to minimize their error rates on the given input data and target outputs.

# 2.Background Introduction
The basic idea behind any machine learning technique or algorithm is to learn patterns from the given data and make predictions about future inputs based on these learned patterns. A typical approach in deep learning is to build complex models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Deep Belief Networks (DBN). These models are constructed by stacking multiple layers of artificial neurons connected together to form a hierarchical structure, where each layer receives input from the previous layer and produces its own output. Each neuron inside a layer takes some weighted sum of its inputs, applies an activation function like sigmoid or tanh, and passes the result forward to the next layer. This process continues until all the input samples have been processed and classified into appropriate categories.

When we train these complex models on large datasets, there can be several issues related to overfitting and underfitting of the model. Overfitting refers to when the model starts fitting the noise present in the dataset instead of the underlying pattern. Underfitting happens when the model fails to capture important features of the data. Both overfitting and underfitting can occur due to various reasons like insufficient number of training examples, too many hidden units, non-smooth decision boundary, etc. To avoid these problems, regularization techniques like L1/L2 regularization, Dropout, early stopping, etc., are often employed during the training phase.

One of the popular regularization techniques for preventing overfitting is dropout. In dropout, a randomly selected subset of neurons in each layer is deactivated during training, thus forcing the network to learn more robust representations of the input data without relying on any single neuron alone. During testing, all the neurons are activated simultaneously to produce the final prediction. Another regularization technique is known as batch normalization which normalizes the output of each neuron to zero mean and unit variance before passing it to the subsequent layer. Batch normalization improves the stability and speed of convergence of the model during training.

Despite all the advantages of deep learning, building and training neural networks still remains challenging even for experts. There are different architectures available for building neural networks, hyperparameters to tune, and strategies for training. Furthermore, debugging errors and implementing improvements requires expertise in math, programming, and statistics.

Backpropagation is one of the most commonly used optimization algorithms in deep learning for minimizing the cost function. Its key insight is to compute the derivative of the cost function with respect to every parameter in the network and use it to update the values of those parameters to reduce the error of the model. By doing so, the model learns how to map the input data to the correct output and avoids overfitting or underfitting of the data. Backpropagation has been found to perform well in many tasks including image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning.

This article will focus on explaining the basics of backpropagation algorithm alongside with a simple code implementation in Python and NumPy library. We will also look at applications of backpropagation in real-world scenarios such as sentiment analysis and object detection.


# 3.Basic Concepts and Terminology
Let us now briefly discuss the key concepts and terminology associated with backpropagation.

## Input Layer
The first layer of neurons in our neural network represents the input features. For instance, if we want to classify images, the input layer would take pixels of the image as input. If we want to predict stock prices, the input layer could consist of attributes such as opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, volume traded, day of week, month, year, etc.

## Hidden Layers
Hidden layers play a crucial role in defining the complexity of the neural network. They receive input from the previous layer and generate output for the current layer. In between these two layers, there may be one or more additional layers, depending on the requirements of the problem at hand.

Each neuron in a hidden layer takes a weighted sum of the inputs received from the previous layer, applies an activation function (such as sigmoid, tanh, or relu), and passes the result forward to the next layer. Activation functions introduce non-linearity in the output of the neuron, allowing the model to learn more complex relationships between the input features and the output. Common activation functions include sigmoid, softmax, tanh, ReLU, LeakyReLU, ELU, and Maxout.

## Output Layer
The last layer of neurons in the neural network generates the final predicted value. Depending on the task at hand, the output layer might be a binary classifier, multi-class classifier, or regression model. When dealing with classification tasks, the output layer usually consists of a single neuron with a sigmoid or softmax activation function, whereas in case of regression tasks, the output layer contains a single neuron with linear activation function.

## Cost Function
Cost function measures the difference between the predicted output of the model and the actual target output. As we train the model on new input data, we try to find the set of parameters (weights and biases) that minimizes the cost function. One common cost function used in deep learning is the Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) function, which computes the squared differences between the predicted output and the true label, sums them up across all the training samples, and averages the results. Other cost functions like cross entropy and Huber Loss are also commonly used in practice.

## Gradient Descent
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that uses the derivative of the cost function with respect to the parameters to update the values of those parameters iteratively. At each step, the algorithm updates the values of the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient of the cost function. With each update, the objective of the model becomes closer to optimal and eventually converges to a minimum point where the cost function is minimized. The rate of convergence is controlled by the learning rate hyperparameter.

## Derivatives
The derivative of a scalar field gives the slope of the curve. Similarly, the derivative of a vector field gives the direction of steepest increase, giving rise to the notion of the gradient. Calculating the derivative of a multivariate function involves taking the partial derivatives with respect to each variable and integrating them. Therefore, calculating the derivative of a cost function with respect to the weights and biases of a neural network involves taking the partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias term, respectively.

## Forward Propagation
Forward propagation is the process of computing the output of each neuron in the neural network, starting from the input layer and going through the hidden layers. It involves multiplying the input feature vector by the corresponding weights matrix and adding the bias vector element-wise. The resulting dot product forms the input to the activation function applied to the neuron. The output of each neuron is passed on to the next layer in turn until the output layer is reached.

## Backward Propagation
Backward propagation is similar to forward propagation but works in reverse order, i.e., it starts from the output layer and goes backwards through the hidden layers. During backward propagation, the contribution of each neuron to the error signal is calculated and propagated back to the preceding neurons in the same way as in forward propagation. However, instead of multiplying the weights and adding the bias vector, the activations of the neurons are multiplied by their respective partial derivatives w.r.t. the cost function, computed during the training stage. This calculation is done efficiently using efficient matrix multiplication operations implemented using high performance libraries like CUDA, cuDNN, or MKL.

Once we know the contributions of each neuron to the total error, we can update the weights and biases of each neuron accordingly using gradient descent. The learning rate controls the size of each step taken towards reducing the error.

Overall, the steps involved in backpropagation are as follows:

1. Initialize the weights and biases randomly or using pre-trained values
2. Feed forward the input data through the network and calculate the output
3. Calculate the error of the network using the chosen cost function
4. Perform backward propagation to get the derivative of the cost function with respect to each weight and bias term
5. Update the weights and biases using gradient descent with the calculated derivative and learning rate
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the cost function stops changing significantly or reaches a plateau

# 4.Python Implementation
Now let us see a sample implementation of backpropagation algorithm using Python and NumPy libraries. We will implement a simple three-layer neural network with sigmoid activation function to classify two-dimensional points. Let's start by importing necessary modules and initializing the random seed.

``` python
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(123) # initialize the random seed

```

We will create a synthetic dataset containing two-dimensional points and their labels. We will use a noisy XOR distribution to simulate the presence of outliers in the dataset.

``` python
X = np.array([[0.7, -0.9], [0.1, -0.6], [-0.8, -0.6], [-0.6, 0.2]])
Y = np.array([[-1.],[-1.], [+1.], [+1.]])

```

Next, we will define the sigmoid activation function, which maps any input value between 0 and 1. It helps to restrict the output of each neuron to a range between 0 and 1, enabling faster convergence of the network during training.

```python
def sigmoid(z):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))
```

Then we will define the feedforward function, which performs forward propagation through the network. It takes the input data X, the weights W1, b1, weights W2, and bias b2 as arguments.

```python
def forward_prop(X, W1, b1, W2, b2):
    
    # Layer 1
    Z1 = np.dot(X, W1) + b1
    A1 = sigmoid(Z1)
    
    # Layer 2
    Z2 = np.dot(A1, W2) + b2
    A2 = sigmoid(Z2)
    
    return A2
    
```

Similarly, we will define the backward propagation function, which calculates the partial derivative of the cost function with respect to each weight and bias term and updates them using gradient descent. Note that we need to pass the input data X, the true targets Y, and the cost function to the backward propagation function.

```python
def backward_prop(X, Y, C, W1, b1, W2, b2):

    m = len(X)
    
    # Layer 1
    Z1 = np.dot(X, W1) + b1
    A1 = sigmoid(Z1)
    
    # Layer 2
    Z2 = np.dot(A1, W2) + b2
    A2 = sigmoid(Z2)
    
    dZ2 = A2 - Y    
    dW2 = (1./m) * np.dot(A1.T, dZ2)
    db2 = (1./m) * np.sum(dZ2, axis=0, keepdims=True)
    
    dA1 = np.dot(dZ2, W2.T)
    dZ1 = dA1 * sigmoid(Z1)*(1-sigmoid(Z1)) 
    dW1 = (1./m) * np.dot(X.T, dZ1)
    db1 = (1./m) * np.sum(dZ1, axis=0, keepdims=True)
    
    grads = {"dW1": dW1,
             "db1": db1,
             "dW2": dW2,
             "db2": db2}
    
    return grads
```

Finally, we will put everything together to train the model on the dataset. First, we will define the hyperparameters of the network, including the number of epochs, learning rate, and mini-batch size. Then, we will split the dataset into training and validation sets. After that, we will loop through the training set for the specified number of epochs, performing mini-batch gradient descent after each epoch. Finally, we will evaluate the trained model on the validation set and print the accuracy of the model.

```python
# Hyperparameters
learning_rate = 0.1
num_epochs = 1000
minibatch_size = 4

# Split the dataset into training and validation sets
m = len(X)
permutation = np.random.permutation(m)
train_idx = permutation[:int(.8*m)]
val_idx = permutation[int(.8*m):]

X_train = X[train_idx,:]
Y_train = Y[train_idx,:]
X_val = X[val_idx,:]
Y_val = Y[val_idx,:]

# Train the model
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    
    # Shuffle the dataset
    permute = np.random.permutation(len(X_train))
    shuffled_X = X_train[permute]
    shuffled_Y = Y_train[permute]
    
    # Loop through the dataset in minibatches
    for i in range(0, len(shuffled_X)-minibatch_size+1, minibatch_size):
        
        # Select a minibatch
        X_mini = shuffled_X[i:i+minibatch_size]
        Y_mini = shuffled_Y[i:i+minibatch_size]
        
        # Compute the cost and gradients
        A2 = forward_prop(X_mini, W1, b1, W2, b2)
        C = np.mean((A2 - Y_mini)**2)
        grads = backward_prop(X_mini, Y_mini, C, W1, b1, W2, b2)

        # Update the weights and biases using gradient descent
        W1 -= learning_rate * grads["dW1"]
        b1 -= learning_rate * grads["db1"]
        W2 -= learning_rate * grads["dW2"]
        b2 -= learning_rate * grads["db2"]
        
    # Evaluate the model on the validation set
    A2_val = forward_prop(X_val, W1, b1, W2, b2)
    acc = np.mean(np.abs(A2_val - Y_val)<1e-2)*100
    print("Epoch", epoch, ": Validation Accuracy = ", round(acc,2))
```

The above code should give you a good understanding of how to apply backpropagation algorithm to a simple neural network and solve a supervised learning problem. You can experiment with different architectures, activation functions, and hyperparameters to achieve better performance.

# 5.Applications of Backpropagation
Besides being a powerful optimization method in deep learning, backpropagation has several practical applications in various fields. Here are some of the highlights:

## Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is a text classification problem where we aim to identify the polarity of a given sentence as positive, negative, or neutral. It can be useful in identifying customer feedback, social media trends, brand reputation, and other aspects of business. One common approach for solving this problem is to represent each word in the sentence as a numerical vector representation and train a neural network to predict the polarity of the sentence. The most commonly used representation scheme is the Bag-of-Words approach, where we count the frequency of each unique word in the vocabulary and assign a fixed length vector to the sentence.

Another popular application of sentiment analysis is detecting fake news spread online. Many websites post false information on social media, such as fake political ads or scams. Using historical Twitter posts and blog articles, researchers developed a statistical model that can accurately predict whether a piece of news is true or false. Their approach was to preprocess the text data to extract relevant features and use LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to encode temporal dependencies in the data. The LSTM cell processes sequential input data by maintaining a memory state that captures long-term interactions between words. During training, the model tries to minimize the cross-entropy loss between the predicted probability of the true class versus the predicted probabilities for both classes.

## Object Detection
Object detection is another computer vision task where we need to locate and classify objects within an image. One common approach is to use deep convolutional neural networks such as ResNet or SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) that were designed to work well for large scale object detection tasks. While CNNs provide impressive accuracy, they suffer from computational overhead and require large amounts of labeled data to train effectively.

To address these challenges, Fast R-CNN, RPN (Region Proposal Network), and Mask RCNN have emerged as leading approaches for object detection. Faster R-CNN builds upon ResNet and achieves real-time inference. RPN provides anchor boxes around potential objects in the image and selects only the ones with high likelihood. Lastly, Mask RCNN adds a pixel-level mask branch to the model that estimates the shape and position of the detected object. Overall, these techniques demonstrate how deep learning techniques can help improve the efficiency and accuracy of traditional object detection systems.

## Machine Translation
Machine translation is yet another NLP task where we need to convert text from one language to another. One common approach is to use recurrent neural networks (RNN) with attention mechanisms that analyze the context of sentences and translate them sequentially. Attention allows the decoder to selectively pay attention to certain parts of the source sentence during each decoding step. Researchers have proposed many variations of sequence to sequence models, such as encoder-decoder, transformers, and variants of attention-based models, that have shown significant improvements over standard seq2seq models.
