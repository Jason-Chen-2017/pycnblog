In the realm of data center cost optimization, mathematical models and formulas play a crucial role in quantifying and optimizing various cost components. In this section, we will delve into the key mathematical models and formulas used in data center cost optimization, provide detailed explanations, and illustrate their application through examples.

#### 1. Cost of Resources

The cost of resources is one of the most significant components in data center operations. This includes the costs of computational resources, storage, network bandwidth, and power. The following formulas can be used to calculate these costs:

**Formula for Cost of Computational Resources**:
\[ C_{CPU} = \text{CPU\_Cost} \times \text{CPU\_Utilization} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ C_{GPU} = \text{GPU\_Cost} \times \text{GPU\_Utilization} \times \text{Time} \]

Where:
- \( C_{CPU} \) and \( C_{GPU} \) are the costs of CPU and GPU resources, respectively.
- \( \text{CPU\_Cost} \) and \( \text{GPU\_Cost} \) are the per-unit costs of CPU and GPU resources.
- \( \text{CPU\_Utilization} \) and \( \text{GPU\_Utilization} \) are the utilization rates of CPU and GPU resources.
- \( \text{Time} \) is the duration of resource usage.

**Example Calculation**:
Assuming a CPU cost of \$0.10 per hour, a CPU utilization rate of 70%, and a GPU cost of \$0.50 per hour with a GPU utilization rate of 40%, the cost for 24 hours would be:
\[ C_{CPU} = \$0.10 \times 0.70 \times 24 = \$2.08 \]
\[ C_{GPU} = \$0.50 \times 0.40 \times 24 = \$4.80 \]

**Total Cost**: \$2.08 (CPU) + \$4.80 (GPU) = \$6.88

**Formula for Cost of Storage**:
\[ C_{Storage} = \text{Storage\_Cost} \times \text{Storage\_Utilization} \times \text{Time} \]

Where:
- \( C_{Storage} \) is the cost of storage resources.
- \( \text{Storage\_Cost} \) is the per-unit cost of storage resources.
- \( \text{Storage\_Utilization} \) is the utilization rate of storage resources.

**Example Calculation**:
Assuming a storage cost of \$0.05 per GB-month, a storage utilization rate of 80%, and a duration of 3 months, the cost would be:
\[ C_{Storage} = \$0.05 \times 0.80 \times 3 = \$0.12 \]

**Total Cost**: \$0.12

**Formula for Cost of Network Bandwidth**:
\[ C_{Bandwidth} = \text{Bandwidth\_Cost} \times \text{Bandwidth\_Utilization} \times \text{Time} \]

Where:
- \( C_{Bandwidth} \) is the cost of network bandwidth.
- \( \text{Bandwidth\_Cost} \) is the per-unit cost of network bandwidth.
- \( \text{Bandwidth\_Utilization} \) is the utilization rate of network bandwidth.

**Example Calculation**:
Assuming a bandwidth cost of \$0.20 per GB-month, a bandwidth utilization rate of 60%, and a duration of 3 months, the cost would be:
\[ C_{Bandwidth} = \$0.20 \times 0.60 \times 3 = \$0.36 \]

**Total Cost**: \$0.36

**Total Resource Cost**:
\[ C_{Total} = C_{CPU} + C_{GPU} + C_{Storage} + C_{Bandwidth} \]

**Example Calculation**:
\[ C_{Total} = \$6.88 (CPU) + \$4.80 (GPU) + \$0.12 (Storage) + \$0.36 (Bandwidth) = \$12.16 \]

#### 2. Energy Efficiency Models

Energy efficiency in data centers is critical for cost optimization. The following formulas can be used to calculate and optimize energy consumption:

**Formula for Energy Consumption**:
\[ E = P \times t \]

Where:
- \( E \) is the total energy consumption in kWh.
- \( P \) is the power consumption in kW.
- \( t \) is the duration of time in hours.

**Example Calculation**:
Assuming a power consumption of 100 kW and a duration of 24 hours, the energy consumption would be:
\[ E = 100 \times 24 = 2400 \text{ kWh} \]

**Formula for Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)**:
\[ PUE = \frac{\text{Total Facility Energy}}{\text{IT Equipment Energy}} \]

Where:
- \( PUE \) is the Power Usage Effectiveness.
- \( \text{Total Facility Energy} \) is the total energy consumed by the data center.
- \( \text{IT Equipment Energy} \) is the energy consumed by IT equipment.

**Example Calculation**:
Assuming a Total Facility Energy of 3000 kWh and an IT Equipment Energy of 2000 kWh, the PUE would be:
\[ PUE = \frac{3000}{2000} = 1.5 \]

**Formula for Energy Efficiency Improvement**:
\[ \text{Efficiency Improvement} = \frac{\text{New PUE} - \text{Old PUE}}{\text{Old PUE}} \]

**Example Calculation**:
Assuming the PUE improved from 1.5 to 1.3, the efficiency improvement would be:
\[ \text{Efficiency Improvement} = \frac{1.3 - 1.5}{1.5} = -0.1333 \text{ (or -13.33%)} \]

#### 3. Capacity Planning Models

Capacity planning is essential for ensuring that data centers can scale efficiently to meet future demands. The following formulas can be used to forecast future capacity requirements:

**Formula for Capacity Demand**:
\[ \text{Capacity Demand} = \text{Current Capacity} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate})^n \]

Where:
- \( \text{Capacity Demand} \) is the future capacity required.
- \( \text{Current Capacity} \) is the current capacity.
- \( \text{Growth Rate} \) is the annual growth rate of demand.
- \( n \) is the number of years.

**Example Calculation**:
Assuming a current capacity of 1000 servers and a growth rate of 10% per year, the capacity demand after 3 years would be:
\[ \text{Capacity Demand} = 1000 \times (1 + 0.10)^3 = 1000 \times 1.331 = 1331 \text{ servers} \]

**Formula for Capacity Utilization**:
\[ \text{Capacity Utilization} = \frac{\text{Actual Capacity}}{\text{Required Capacity}} \]

Where:
- \( \text{Capacity Utilization} \) is the ratio of actual capacity to required capacity.

**Example Calculation**:
Assuming an actual capacity of 1200 servers and a required capacity of 1000 servers, the capacity utilization would be:
\[ \text{Capacity Utilization} = \frac{1200}{1000} = 1.2 \text{ (or 120%)} \]

**Formula for Capacity Gap**:
\[ \text{Capacity Gap} = \text{Required Capacity} - \text{Actual Capacity} \]

**Example Calculation**:
Assuming a required capacity of 1200 servers and an actual capacity of 1000 servers, the capacity gap would be:
\[ \text{Capacity Gap} = 1200 - 1000 = 200 \text{ servers} \]

In conclusion, the use of mathematical models and formulas is essential for effective data center cost optimization. These models enable precise quantification of resource costs, energy consumption, and capacity requirements, allowing enterprises to make informed decisions and implement targeted optimization strategies. Through detailed explanation and examples, we have highlighted the practical application of these models, providing a foundation for further exploration and practical implementation.
