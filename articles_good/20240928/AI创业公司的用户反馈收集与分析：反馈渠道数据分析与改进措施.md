### 2.4 Mathematical Models and Formulas & Detailed Explanation & Examples

In the process of analyzing user feedback, mathematical models and formulas play a crucial role in extracting meaningful insights from the collected data. These models enable startups to quantify and interpret user feedback, providing a foundation for data-driven decision-making. Below, we discuss several key mathematical models and formulas used in user feedback analysis, along with detailed explanations and examples.

#### 2.4.1 Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is a common technique used to determine the emotional tone of user feedback. It classifies text data into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. This analysis helps startups understand user sentiment and identify areas of concern or improvement.

**Core Formula**:

$$
Sentiment\ Score = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (w_i \cdot s_i)
$$

Where:
- \( w_i \) represents the weight of each sentiment word.
- \( s_i \) represents the sentiment score of each word (usually +1 for positive, -1 for negative, and 0 for neutral).

**Example**:

Consider the following sentence: "The new feature is great, but the user interface is confusing."

**Step-by-Step Calculation**:

1. **Tokenize the Sentence**: ["The", "new", "feature", "is", "great", ",", "but", "the", "user", "interface", "is", "confusing"]

2. **Determine Sentiment Scores**: Assign sentiment scores to each word. For simplicity, we'll use +1 for positive words and -1 for negative words.
   - "great": +1
   - "confusing": -1

3. **Calculate the Sentiment Score**:
   $$
   Sentiment\ Score = (w_{great} \cdot 1) + (w_{confusing} \cdot -1) = 1 - 1 = 0
   $$

The sentiment score of the sentence is 0, indicating a neutral sentiment.

#### 2.4.2 Topic Modeling

Topic modeling is a statistical method used to discover abstract topics within a collection of documents. It helps startups identify the main themes discussed in user feedback, providing insights into user interests and preferences.

**Core Model**:

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a popular topic modeling technique that assumes documents are a mixture of topics, and each topic is a mixture of words.

**Formula**:

$$
P(z|\alpha, \beta) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(N) \prod_{k=1}^{K} \Gamma(\alpha_k)} \prod_{n=1}^{N} \left( \frac{1}{\Gamma(\sum_{k=1}^{K} \beta_{ik})} \prod_{k=1}^{K} \frac{\beta_{ik}^{w_{ik,n}}}{\sum_{j=1}^{V} \beta_{ij}^{w_{ik,n}}} \right)
$$

Where:
- \( z \) represents the topic assignment for each word.
- \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are hyperparameters.
- \( K \) is the number of topics.
- \( V \) is the vocabulary size.
- \( w_{ik,n} \) is the count of word \( i \) in document \( n \) topic \( k \).

**Example**:

Consider a collection of user feedback documents with three topics: "product features," "usability," and "support."

**Step-by-Step Calculation**:

1. **Preprocess the Text**: Tokenize and convert text data into a document-term matrix.

2. **Fit the LDA Model**: Use the document-term matrix to fit an LDA model with three topics.

3. **Extract Topics**: Generate topic distributions for each document. For example, a document might have the following topic distribution: [0.3, 0.4, 0.3], indicating that it covers "product features," "usability," and "support" in roughly equal proportions.

#### 2.4.3 Clustering Analysis

Clustering analysis is used to group similar user feedback entries together, enabling startups to identify different segments of their user base. This can help in tailoring product improvements to specific user groups.

**Core Model**:

K-means clustering is a popular method for partitioning data into K clusters, where each data point belongs to the nearest cluster center.

**Formula**:

$$
c_j = \frac{1}{N_j} \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{ij}
$$

Where:
- \( c_j \) is the centroid of cluster \( j \).
- \( N_j \) is the number of points in cluster \( j \).
- \( x_{ij} \) is the value of feature \( i \) for data point \( j \).

**Example**:

Consider a dataset of user feedback with two features: "satisfaction" and "frequency of use."

**Step-by-Step Calculation**:

1. **Select K**: Choose the number of clusters \( K \) (e.g., 3).

2. **Initialize centroids**: Randomly select \( K \) data points as initial centroids.

3. **Assign points to clusters**: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.

4. **Update centroids**: Recompute the centroids based on the assigned data points.

5. **Iterate**: Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the centroids no longer change significantly.

The resulting clusters can be analyzed to understand different user segments and tailor product improvements accordingly.

By applying these mathematical models and formulas, AI startups can gain valuable insights from user feedback, making informed decisions to improve product quality and user satisfaction. These techniques provide a quantitative basis for understanding user behavior and preferences, enabling more effective product development and customer engagement strategies.

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score
from gensim.models import LdaModel
import gensim

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('customer_reviews.csv')

# Preprocess the text data
def preprocess_text(text):
    # Convert text to lowercase
    text = text.lower()
    # Remove punctuation and special characters
    text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9\s]', '', text)
    # Tokenize text
    tokens = text.split()
    # Remove stop words
    stop_words = set('for a of and to in with on at by from up about out if will not but are these be an they have I it at not be to in this that it by on with at from they we all have I do you your him her its me her him them us our about if and but what when where who'
                    .split())
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in stop_words]
    # Rejoin tokens into a single string
    return ' '.join(tokens)

df['preprocessed_text'] = df['review_text'].apply(preprocess_text)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df['preprocessed_text'], df['rating'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

#### 2.5.4 Feature Extraction

Next, we extract features from the preprocessed text data using TF-IDF vectorization.

```python
# Vectorize the text data
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1000)
X_train_vectorized = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_vectorized = vectorizer.transform(X_test)
```

#### 2.5.5 Model Training

We will use a Naive Bayes classifier to classify reviews based on their ratings.

```python
# Train the classifier
classifier = MultinomialNB()
classifier.fit(X_train_vectorized, y_train)

# Predict the ratings for the test set
y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test_vectorized)

# Evaluate the classifier
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
```

#### 2.5.6 Insight Extraction and Visualization

After training the model, we can extract insights and visualize the results.

```python
# Extract top features for each class
feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()
top_features = []
for i in range(len(feature_names)):
    top_features.append(feature_names[i] for i in classifier.feature_importances_ > 0.1)

# Visualize top features for each class
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from wordcloud import WordCloud

wordclouds = []
for class_idx, class_name in enumerate(['positive', 'negative']):
    top_features_class = top_features[class_idx]
    wordcloud = WordCloud(background_color='white', width=800, height=800, max_words=100).generate(' '.join(top_features_class))
    wordclouds.append(wordcloud)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)
plt.imshow(wordclouds[0], interpolation='bilinear')
plt.title('Positive Features')
plt.axis('off')

plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)
plt.imshow(wordclouds[1], interpolation='bilinear')
plt.title('Negative Features')
plt.axis('off')

plt.show()
```

#### 2.5.7 Running the Project

To run the project, execute the above code snippets in a Python script or Jupyter Notebook. The output will include a classification report and accuracy score, as well as word clouds visualizing the top features for positive and negative reviews.

By following these steps, we can see how user feedback can be effectively collected, preprocessed, and analyzed to extract actionable insights.
