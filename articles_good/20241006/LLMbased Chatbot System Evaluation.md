        self.hidden_bias = np.random.randn(hidden_size)
        self.output_bias = np.random.randn(output_size)

    def forward_pass(self, inputs):
        hidden activations = sigmoid(np.dot(inputs, self.weights_input_to_hidden) + self.hidden_bias)
        output activations = sigmoid(np.dot(hidden activations, self.weights_hidden_to_output) + self.output_bias)
        return output_activations

    def backward_pass(self, inputs, outputs, output_activations):

        self.output_bias += output_delta

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def sigmoid_derivative(x):
    return x * (1 - x)
```

### 3.3 Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of RNN that addresses the vanishing gradient problem, allowing it to learn long-term dependencies in sequential data. LSTMs are particularly effective in chatbot systems for generating coherent and contextually relevant responses. The following pseudo-code illustrates the basic architecture and training process of an LSTM:

```python
class LSTM:
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        self.input_size = input_size
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size

        self.forget_gate_weights = np.random.randn(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.input_gate_weights = np.random.randn(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.output_gate_weights = np.random.randn(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.cells = np.random.randn(hidden_size)
        self.hidden_bias = np.random.randn(hidden_size)
        self.output_bias = np.random.randn(output_size)

    def forward_pass(self, inputs):
        forget_gate = sigmoid(np.dot(inputs, self.forget_gate_weights) + self.hidden_bias)
        input_gate = sigmoid(np.dot(inputs, self.input_gate_weights) + self.hidden_bias)
        output_gate = sigmoid(np.dot(inputs, self.output_gate_weights) + self.hidden_bias)
        cell = self.cells * forget_gate + input_gate * tanh(np.dot(inputs, self.input_gate_weights) + self.hidden_bias)
        self.cells = cell
        hidden_state = output_gate * tanh(cell)
        output_activations = sigmoid(np.dot(hidden_state, self.output_bias))
        return output_activations

    def backward_pass(self, inputs, outputs, output_activations):
        output_error = outputs - output_activations
        output_delta = output_error * sigmoid_derivative(output_activations)

        cell_derivative = output_delta * sigmoid_derivative(output_gate) * tanh_derivative(self.cells)
        forget_gate_derivative = cell_derivative * sigmoid_derivative(self.cells) * sigmoid_derivative(self.forget_gate)
        input_gate_derivative = cell_derivative * sigmoid_derivative(self.cells) * tanh_derivative(np.dot(inputs, self.input_gate_weights) + self.hidden_bias) * sigmoid_derivative(self.input_gate)
        hidden_state_derivative = cell_derivative * sigmoid_derivative(self.cells) * tanh_derivative(cell)

```

By understanding the core algorithm principles and their step-by-step implementation, we can better appreciate the complexities involved in developing and optimizing LLM-based chatbot systems. In the following sections, we will explore the mathematical models and formulas used in these systems, providing further insights into their underlying mechanisms.

## 4. Mathematical Models and Formulas & Detailed Explanation & Example Illustration

### 4.1. Introduction to Mathematical Models

Mathematical models play a crucial role in the functioning of LLM-based chatbot systems. They enable the representation and analysis of complex phenomena, such as natural language understanding, dialogue management, and response generation. In this section, we will delve into some of the key mathematical models used in these systems, providing detailed explanations and examples to help readers understand their concepts and applications.

### 4.2. Neural Network Models

Neural networks are the backbone of LLM-based chatbot systems. They are composed of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process and transmit information through weighted connections. The following sections discuss some of the fundamental mathematical models used in neural networks:

#### 4.2.1. Activation Functions

Activation functions determine the output of a neuron based on its input. They introduce non-linearities into the network, enabling it to model complex relationships. Common activation functions include the sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent (tanh), and rectified linear unit (ReLU) functions.

**Sigmoid Function**

The sigmoid function is defined as:

$$
\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
$$

**Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh) Function**

The hyperbolic tangent function is defined as:

$$
\tanh(x) = \frac{e^{x} - e^{-x}}{e^{x} + e^{-x}}
$$

**Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) Function**

The ReLU function is defined as:

$$
\text{ReLU}(x) =
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } x < 0 \\
x & \text{if } x \geq 0
\end{cases}
$$

#### 4.2.2. Backpropagation Algorithm

Backpropagation is an algorithm used to train neural networks by adjusting the weights and biases based on the error between the predicted and actual outputs. It involves the following steps:

1. **Forward Pass**: Compute the network outputs by propagating the inputs through the network.
2. **Compute Gradients**: Calculate the gradients of the error with respect to the weights and biases.
3. **Update Weights and Biases**: Adjust the weights and biases based on the computed gradients using an optimization algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD).

**Gradient Computation**

The gradients of the error with respect to the weights and biases can be computed using the chain rule. For a single-layer neural network with input \(x\), output \(y\), and weights \(w\), the gradient of the error with respect to \(w\) is:

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial w} = \frac{\partial E}{\partial y} \frac{\partial y}{\partial w}
$$

**Example**

Consider a simple neural network with one input, one hidden layer with one neuron, and one output. Let \(x\) be the input, \(y\) be the output, and \(w\) be the weight. The error \(E\) is given by:

$$
E = (y - \sigma(w \cdot x))^2
$$

The gradient of the error with respect to \(w\) is:

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial w} = -2(y - \sigma(w \cdot x)) \cdot \sigma'(w \cdot x)
$$

Using the sigmoid derivative:

$$
\sigma'(x) = \sigma(x) \cdot (1 - \sigma(x))
$$

The gradient can be simplified to:

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial w} = -2(y - \sigma(w \cdot x)) \cdot \sigma(w \cdot x) \cdot (1 - \sigma(w \cdot x))
$$

### 4.3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are designed to handle sequential data, such as text. They maintain a hidden state that captures information about the previous inputs and is used to generate the current output. The following sections discuss some of the key mathematical models used in RNNs:

#### 4.3.1. Hidden State Update

The hidden state \(h_t\) of an RNN at time step \(t\) is updated using the following formula:

$$
h_t = \text{tanh}(W_h \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_h)
$$

where \(W_h\) is the weight matrix, \(b_h\) is the bias vector, and \([h_{t-1}, x_t]\) is the concatenated hidden state and input at time step \(t\).

#### 4.3.2. Output Generation

The output \(y_t\) at time step \(t\) is generated using the following formula:

$$
y_t = W_o \cdot h_t + b_o
$$

where \(W_o\) is the weight matrix and \(b_o\) is the bias vector.

#### 4.3.3. Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)

Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) is an extension of the backpropagation algorithm used to train RNNs. It involves the following steps:

1. **Forward Pass**: Compute the network outputs and hidden states by propagating the inputs through the network.
2. **Compute Gradients**: Calculate the gradients of the error with respect to the weights and biases using BPTT.
3. **Update Weights and Biases**: Adjust the weights and biases based on the computed gradients using an optimization algorithm, such as SGD.

**Gradient Computation**

The gradients of the error with respect to the weights and biases can be computed using the chain rule. For an RNN with input \(x\), output \(y\), hidden state \(h\), and weights \(W_h\), \(W_o\), the gradient of the error with respect to \(W_h\) is:

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial W_h} = \sum_{t} \frac{\partial E}{\partial h_t} \frac{\partial h_t}{\partial W_h}
$$

Using the chain rule and the hidden state update formula, the gradient can be simplified to:

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial W_h} = \sum_{t} (\frac{\partial E}{\partial h_t} \odot (1 - \tanh^2(h_t))) \odot [h_{t-1}, x_t]
$$

where \(\odot\) denotes the element-wise product.

### 4.4. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of RNN that addresses the vanishing gradient problem, allowing it to learn long-term dependencies in sequential data. The following sections discuss some of the key mathematical models used in LSTMs:

#### 4.4.1. LSTM Cell

The LSTM cell consists of several gates and a memory cell. The key components are:

- **Forget Gate**: Determines which information from the previous hidden state should be forgotten.
- **Input Gate**: Controls the information that should be updated in the memory cell.
- **Output Gate**: Determines which information from the memory cell should be used to generate the current output.

The formulas for these gates and the memory cell are:

$$
f_t = \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f) \\
i_t = \sigma(W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i) \\
o_t = \sigma(W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o) \\
c_t = f_t \odot c_{t-1} + i_t \odot \tanh(W_c \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_c) \\
h_t = o_t \odot \tanh(c_t)
$$

where \(f_t\), \(i_t\), \(o_t\), and \(c_t\) are the forget, input, output, and memory cell gates at time step \(t\), and \(W_f\), \(W_i\), \(W_o\), \(W_c\), \(b_f\), \(b_i\), \(b_o\), and \(b_c\) are the corresponding weight matrices and biases.

#### 4.4.2. Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)

The BPTT algorithm for LSTMs is similar to that of RNNs, with additional considerations for the complex cell structure. The key steps are:

1. **Forward Pass**: Compute the network outputs, hidden states, and gate values by propagating the inputs through the LSTM cell.
2. **Compute Gradients**: Calculate the gradients of the error with respect to the weights and biases using BPTT, taking into account the interactions between the gates and the memory cell.
3. **Update Weights and Biases**: Adjust the weights and biases based on the computed gradients using an optimization algorithm, such as SGD.

**Gradient Computation**

The gradients of the error with respect to the weights and biases can be computed using the chain rule and the LSTM cell formulas. For an LSTM with input \(x\), output \(y\), hidden state \(h\), memory cell \(c\), and weights \(W_f\), \(W_i\), \(W_o\), \(W_c\), \(b_f\), \(b_i\), \(b_o\), and \(b_c\), the gradient of the error with respect to \(W_f\) is:

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial W_f} = \sum_{t} \frac{\partial E}{\partial c_t} \odot (1 - f_t) \odot [h_{t-1}, x_t]
$$

Using the chain rule and the LSTM cell formulas, the gradient can be simplified to:

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial W_f} = \sum_{t} (\frac{\partial E}{\partial c_t} \odot (1 - f_t) \odot (1 - f_{t-1}) \odot [h_{t-2}, x_{t-1}])
$$

The gradients for the other weight matrices and biases can be computed using similar approaches.
