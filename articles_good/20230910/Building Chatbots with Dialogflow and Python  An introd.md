# 1.简介
  

Chatbots or Conversational AI are applications that mimic the way humans interact with technology through text messaging. Chatbots can be used for a variety of purposes such as customer service assistance, personal assistants, and even create entertainment by providing responses in engaging ways. In this article we will explore how to build chatbots using the Dialogflow API from Google Cloud Platform alongside Python programming language.

This is not an exhaustive tutorial on building chatbots but rather just an introductory guide to show you what it takes to get started developing your own chatbot. It assumes some basic knowledge of programming, machine learning, and natural language processing concepts. We also assume that you have access to a Google account and have created a project within the GCP Console. If you don't meet these prerequisites, then please refer to our tutorials on getting set up before proceeding further. 

In this article, we will cover:

1. Setting up the necessary tools
2. Creating a new agent and setting up intents
3. Training and testing the model
4. Integrating the bot into a website or application using webhook integration
5. Adding more functionality like fetching weather data based on user queries etc.

By the end of this tutorial, you should have built your first chatbot using Dialogflow and Python!


# 2.基本概念术语说明
Before we start writing code let's understand some of the key terms and technologies involved.

## Natural Language Processing(NLP): 
Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the ability of machines to understand human languages naturally. The primary purpose of NLP systems is to extract meaningful information from unstructured text and translate it into computer-readable form so that computers can process them more easily. There are several subtasks associated with NLP tasks including language modeling, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, topic detection, relation extraction, speech recognition/generation, and question answering. Within the scope of Chatbots, one common task is Intent Analysis which involves extracting the intention behind the user's query and mapping it to predefined actions or functions.

## TensorFlow: 
TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. It was originally developed by the Google Brain Team for deep learning models running on large datasets. At its core, TensorFlow provides a flexible framework for constructing machine learning models that can run on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs across a range of tasks, such as image classification, regression, clustering, and natural language processing. As part of our example, we will use TensorFlow to train our chatbot model.

## Keras:
Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was introduced by <NAME> as part of his research effort for the development of Deep Learning algorithms. Keras makes implementing complex deep learning models simple while abstracting away many of the underlying details. For instance, we can define layers of our neural network without worrying about tensor shapes, initialization strategies, regularization techniques, activation functions, optimization algorithms, or other low-level concerns. By relying upon Keras, we can focus on building our chatbot logic rather than reinventing the wheel.

## Dialogflow:
Dialogflow is a conversational AI platform provided by Google Cloud Platform that enables developers to design and integrate conversation flows into their mobile apps, web sites, devices, and bots. Developers can design conversations using natural language prompts called intents, and assign parameters to entities to handle contextual variations. When users input text messages, Dialogflow identifies the most appropriate intent and executes the corresponding action or function defined within the agent. It offers prebuilt templates for various use cases such as booking flights, ordering pizza, playing music, and managing calendar events. A single agent can support multiple platforms like SMS, Facebook Messenger, Skype, Twitter, and Google Assistant among others.

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解
Now that we have covered the background and basics, let's dive deeper into the algorithmic side of building chatbots with Dialogflow and Python.

We will go over each step needed to build a simple chatbot using Python and Dialogflow. These steps include:

1. Import Libraries
2. Define Intents & Slots
3. Create Agent & Intents
4. Train Model
5. Test Model
6. Deploy Bot to Webhook URL

### Step 1: Import Libraries
The following libraries need to be imported before starting:

```python
import dialogflow_v2beta1 as dialogflow
from google.oauth2 import service_account
import json
import os
import random
import time
```

Firstly, we import the `dialogflow` module from the `dialogflow_v2beta1` package to interface with the Dialogflow API. Then, we import the `service_account` class from the `google.oauth2` package to authenticate ourselves when making requests to the API. Next, we import the `json` module to parse JSON objects returned by the API and the `os` module to read environment variables containing authentication credentials. Finally, we import the `random`, `time`, modules to generate random responses and control program execution delays.

### Step 2: Define Intents & Slots
Intents define what the bot does and represent the actions that the user wants to perform. Each intent has one or more sample utterances, which are the sentences that trigger the intent. Intents may also have parameters, known as slots, which describe additional pieces of information required to fulfill the intent. For example, if the intent is "book flight" the slot might be "departure date". 

Here is an example of defining two intents, BookHotel and SearchRestaurants. Both intents require different sets of parameters to be fulfilled to complete the task, depending on the specifics of the request. 

```python
# Define Hotel booking intent
hotel_intent = {
    'display_name': 'BookHotel', # Display name of the intent
    'training_phrases': [
        {'text': 'I want to book a hotel'}, # Sample sentence for the intent
        {'text': 'I am looking for a place to stay'} # Another sample sentence for the intent
    ],
    'parameters': [{
        'display_name': 'Location', # Parameter display name
        'entity_type_display_name': '@sys.geo-city', # System Entity type for location parameter
        'is_list': False, # Boolean indicating whether the parameter requires a list of values
       'mandatory': True # Boolean indicating whether the parameter must be included in every training phrase
    }, 
    {
        'display_name': 'Check-in Date', 
        'entity_type_display_name': '@date.check-in', 
        'is_list': False, 
       'mandatory': True
    },
    {
        'display_name': 'Check-out Date', 
        'entity_type_display_name': '@date.check-out', 
        'is_list': False, 
       'mandatory': True
    }]
}

# Define Restaurant search intent
restaurant_intent = {
    'display_name': 'SearchRestaurants',
    'training_phrases': [
        {'text': 'Looking for a place to eat'},
        {'text': 'Recommend me a restaurant near here'}
    ],
    'parameters': [{
        'display_name': 'Restaurant Type',
        'entity_type_display_name': '@cuisine.type',
        'is_list': False,
       'mandatory': True
    }, 
    {
        'display_name': 'Price Range',
        'entity_type_display_name': '$price',
        'is_list': False,
       'mandatory': True
    },
    {
        'display_name': 'Number of Guests',
        'entity_type_display_name': '$guests',
        'is_list': False,
       'mandatory': True
    }]
}
```

### Step 3: Create Agent & Intents
An agent represents the collection of intents, entities, and contexts used to solve your business problems. To create an agent, you'll need to specify the name of the agent and choose a region where it will live. You can also optionally add language and timezone settings. Once you've done that, you can begin adding intents to your agent. Here's an example of creating an agent with two intents:

```python
def create_agent():

    # Set default values for Dialogflow authentication
    credentials = os.environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS']
    project_id = os.environ['PROJECT_ID']
    
    # Authenticate with the Google API client
    try:
        credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(credentials)
        session_client = dialogflow.SessionsClient(credentials=credentials)
    except Exception as e:
        print('Error authenticating:', e)
        return None
    
    # Specify the agent details
    parent = session_client.project_path(project_id)
    agent = {
        'display_name': 'MyAgent',
        'default_language_code': 'en'
    }
    
    # Create the agent
    try:
        response = session_client.create_agent(parent, agent)
        print('Agent created:')
        print('\tName:', response.name)
        print('\tDisplay Name:', response.display_name)
        print('\tDefault Language Code:', response.default_language_code)
    except Exception as e:
        print('Error creating agent:', e)
        return None
    
    # Add the intents to the agent
    try:
        hotels = session_client.create_intent(response.name, hotel_intent)
        restaurants = session_client.create_intent(response.name, restaurant_intent)
        
        print('Intents added to agent:')
        print('\tHotel Intent:', hotels.name)
        print('\tRestaurant Intent:', restaurants.name)
        
    except Exception as e:
        print('Error adding intents to agent:', e)
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    create_agent()
```

In this example, we first retrieve the necessary authentication credentials and configure a session client for interacting with the API. We then specify the agent details, create the agent, and add the intents to the agent using the `create_intent()` method.

Note: Make sure to replace `$PROJECT_ID` with your actual Project ID. Also make sure to store the Service Account Key file path in an environment variable called `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`. This variable tells the SDK where to look for the authentication credentials file.

### Step 4: Train Model
After you've added all of the intents to your agent, you're ready to train the model so that Dialogflow can identify patterns in user queries and map them to the correct intent. Training typically involves feeding Dialogflow examples of both the inputs and outputs you expect during normal operation. Here's an example of training the model:

```python
def train_model():
    
    # Load the JSON object containing the training phrases
    with open('data/train_phrases.json') as f:
        train_phrases = json.load(f)
    
    # Connect to the Dialogflow API and find the agent
    credentials = os.environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS']
    project_id = os.environ['PROJECT_ID']
    
    # Authenticate with the Google API client
    try:
        credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(credentials)
        session_client = dialogflow.SessionsClient(credentials=credentials)
    except Exception as e:
        print('Error authenticating:', e)
        return None
    
    # Find the agent by display name
    agents = session_client.search_agents(project_id, display_name='MyAgent')
    if len(agents)!= 1:
        print('Could not find agent.')
        return None
    else:
        agent_id = agents[0].name.split('/')[-1]
        print('Found agent:', agent_id)
    
    # Iterate through each intent and provide samples of expected input and output
    for intent in ['BookHotel', 'SearchRestaurants']:
        print('Training:', intent)
        training_phrases = []
        for i in range(len(train_phrases[intent])):
            training_phrases.append({'parts': [{'text': train_phrases[intent][i]['text']}]})
            
            if intent == 'BookHotel':
                message = dialogflow.types.Intent.Message(
                        text={'text': [
                            ('Great choice! Do you have any other questions?' +
                             '\nYou can ask me things like "Can I make a reservation?"'+
                             '\nor "What payment options do you offer?" ')
                        ]})
                
            elif intent == 'SearchRestaurants':
                message = dialogflow.types.Intent.Message(
                    text={
                        'text': [
                            ('Enjoy your meal! Did you find anything else interesting? '+
                             '\nTry asking me things like "Where can I find food trucks?"'+
                             '\nor "Do you serve vegetarian food?"')
                        ]
                    })
            
        try:
            session_client.batch_update_intents([
                dialogflow.types.IntentBatch(
                    parent=session_client.intent_path(project_id, agent_id, intent),
                    intents=[
                        dialogflow.types.Intent(
                            display_name=intent,
                            training_phrases=training_phrases,
                            messages=[message],
                            priority=100000
                        )
                    ]
                )])
            
            print('\tSuccessfully trained:', intent)
            
        except Exception as e:
            print('\tError training:', e)
            
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    train_model()
```

In this example, we load a JSON object containing sample training phrases for each intent. We then connect to the Dialogflow API and find the agent specified by display name. We iterate through each intent and provide a sample of expected input and output to Dialogflow. We use the `batch_update_intents()` method to send the updated training phrases to the Dialogflow API for training.

Note: Replace `'./data/train_phrases.json'` with the absolute filepath to your training phrasses JSON object. Also ensure that your training phrases match exactly the ones defined in Step 2.

### Step 5: Test Model
After training the model, you can test it out to see how well it performs against sample queries. Here's an example of testing the model:

```python
def test_model():
    
    # Load the JSON object containing the sample queries
    with open('data/test_queries.json') as f:
        test_queries = json.load(f)
    
    # Connect to the Dialogflow API and find the agent
    credentials = os.environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS']
    project_id = os.environ['PROJECT_ID']
    
    # Authenticate with the Google API client
    try:
        credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(credentials)
        session_client = dialogflow.SessionsClient(credentials=credentials)
    except Exception as e:
        print('Error authenticating:', e)
        return None
    
    # Find the agent by display name
    agents = session_client.search_agents(project_id, display_name='MyAgent')
    if len(agents)!= 1:
        print('Could not find agent.')
        return None
    else:
        agent_id = agents[0].name.split('/')[-1]
        print('Found agent:', agent_id)
        
    # Iterate through each test query and check the predicted intent
    for i in range(len(test_queries)):
        query = test_queries[i]['query']
        result = predict_intent(session_client, project_id, agent_id, query)
        
        print('#{}: "{}"\n\tPredicted Intent:{}'.format(i+1, query, result))
    
    
def predict_intent(session_client, project_id, agent_id, text):
    """
    Predicts the highest scoring intent for a given text input using the
    Dialogflow API. Returns the display name of the predicted intent.
    """
    session = session_client.session_path(project_id, agent_id, str(uuid.uuid4()))
    text_input = dialogflow.types.TextInput(text=text, language_code='en')
    query_input = dialogflow.types.QueryInput(text=text_input)
    
    response = session_client.detect_intent(session=session, query_input=query_input)
    return response.query_result.intent.display_name


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_model()
```

In this example, we load a JSON object containing sample queries. We then connect to the Dialogflow API and find the agent specified by display name. We iterate through each test query and pass it to the `predict_intent()` function to receive the predicted intent back from Dialogflow. We then compare the predicted intent to the true intent labelled in the sample query and calculate the accuracy of the model.

Note: Ensure that your test queries match exactly the ones defined in Step 2.

### Step 6: Deploy Bot to Webhook URL
Finally, once you've tested the model and verified that it works correctly, you can deploy the chatbot to a public URL via webhook integration. This means that incoming HTTP POST requests sent to the webhook URL will trigger Dialogflow to interpret the user's query and respond accordingly. Here's an example of deploying the bot to a Heroku app:

```python
def deploy_webhook():
    
    # Retrieve the endpoint URL from the Heroku CLI
    cmd = 'heroku config:get WEBHOOK_URL --app {}'.format('my-chatbot-app')
    proc = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, shell=True)
    url, err = proc.communicate()
    url = url.decode().strip()
    
    # Update the Dialogflow agent's webhook configuration
    credentials = os.environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS']
    project_id = os.environ['PROJECT_ID']
    
    # Authenticate with the Google API client
    try:
        credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(credentials)
        session_client = dialogflow.SessionsClient(credentials=credentials)
    except Exception as e:
        print('Error authenticating:', e)
        return None
    
    # Find the agent by display name
    agents = session_client.search_agents(project_id, display_name='MyAgent')
    if len(agents)!= 1:
        print('Could not find agent.')
        return None
    else:
        agent_id = agents[0].name.split('/')[-1]
        print('Found agent:', agent_id)
    
    # Configure the webhook for the agent
    webhook = '{}/{}'.format(url, 'webhook')
    try:
        session_client.set_agent(
            session_client.agent_path(project_id, agent_id),
            {"webhook_configuration": {"url": webhook}}
        )
        
        print('Webhook configured successfully.')
    except Exception as e:
        print('Error configuring webhook:', e)
        
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    deploy_webhook()
```

In this example, we use the Heroku CLI tool to retrieve the publicly accessible URL for our deployed chatbot. We then update the Dialogflow agent's webhook configuration to point at our newly created endpoint. Note that the webhook needs to accept HTTP POST requests sent to the `/webhook` endpoint and forward them to the Dialogflow API. Otherwise, the webhook won't work properly.

Note: Replace `'my-chatbot-app'` with the actual name of your Heroku app and replace `'$PROJECT_ID'` with your actual Project ID. Also make sure to store the Service Account Key file path in an environment variable called `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`.
