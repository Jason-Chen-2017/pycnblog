# 1.简介
  

Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) and Firebase Authentication are two of the most popular push notification services in mobile application development. In this article, we will explore how to use these two technologies together to build a secure and reliable messaging service for Android and iOS mobile applications using GCM and Firebase Authentication APIs. We also discuss the security measures taken by developers while building such an app. Finally, we conclude on our observations based on the experiences gained through building various apps with these technologies. The main goal of this article is to educate readers about the integration between GCM and Firebase Authentication, as well as present best practices when it comes to securing their applications. By completing this article, you can have a clear understanding of what makes each technology unique and effective, so that you can make an informed decision when developing your next mobile application.
# 2. 基本概念与术语说明
Firstly, let’s understand some basic concepts related to both GCM and Firebase Authentication.

## GCM (Google Cloud Messaging)
Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) is a free cloud-based messaging system provided by Google. It enables sending notifications to users' devices running Android or iOS operating systems via the Internet. Developers can register their mobile applications with GCM, and then send messages targeted at specific topics or individual users using their server API key. GCM provides several features like message delivery retries, low latency, data throughput optimization, etc., which help improve the reliability and scalability of the messaging system.

## Firebase Authentication
Firebase Authentication is another important component of modern mobile application development. It provides authentication and authorization mechanisms for mobile applications that run on multiple platforms including Android, iOS, web, and other environments. With Firebase Authentication, developers can easily manage user accounts across different platforms without having to rely on third party authentication providers like OAuth or OpenID Connect. In addition, Firebase Authentication offers advanced security features like multi-factor authentication, passwordless login, and session management, which make managing user identities more secure than traditional approaches.

## Firebase Push Notifications
Finally, let's understand how Firebase combines GCM and Firebase Authentication to provide push notifications to mobile clients. When a developer registers their mobile application with Firebase, they receive a project ID and secret key, which are used to configure their device to communicate with the FCM servers. Each time a new message needs to be sent, the developer creates a Notification object containing the desired payload and sends it to one or more registered topics or individual users using the Firebase SDK. The FCM servers forward the message to the corresponding client devices, which display the appropriate notification to the user. This process involves three steps:

1. Register Application with Firebase
2. Create Notification Object with Payload Data
3. Send Message to Recipients Using FCM SDK/API

With these core components in place, we can now proceed with explaining how to integrate them into a mobile application to create a secure and reliable messaging service.

# 3. 核心算法原理及具体操作步骤
Now that we know about GCM and Firebase Authentication, let's dive deeper into how they work together to deliver push notifications to clients. Here are the high level steps involved in integrating GCM and Firebase Authentication to deliver push notifications:

1. Set Up GCP Account and Enable APIs
2. Create Firebase Project and Configure Firebase SDK
3. Add Device Tokens to Firebase Database
4. Implement Server Side Code to Generate User IDs and Send Messages
5. Install Firebase SDK on Client Devices and Receive Notifications

Let’s go over each step in detail below:<|im_sep|>

## Step 1: Set Up GCP Account and Enable APIs
To get started, you need to set up a Google Cloud Platform account if you don't already have one. You should enable both the GCM and Firebase Authentication APIs from the console. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/ and sign in using your Google account.

2. Select “Create a Project” from the drop down menu in the top left corner. Choose a project name and click “Create”.

3. Once the project has been created, navigate to the “APIs & Services” section in the sidebar and select “Dashboard”. Scroll down to find the APIs and click on “Enable API”. Search for and enable both "Cloud Messaging for Firebase" and "Firebase Authentication".


## Step 2: Create Firebase Project and Configure Firebase SDK
Next, you need to create a Firebase project in the Firebase Console. Navigate back to the Dashboard and click on the “Get Started” button underneath "Cloud Messaging for Firebase". Follow the instructions to connect your Firebase project to your Google Cloud project.

Once connected, copy the Firebase configuration details (including the Firebase database URL) and paste them into your app code. For iOS, add the following line to your Info.plist file:

```xml
<key>FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL</key>
<string>[YOUR DATABASE URL]</string>
```

For Android, add the firebase configuration snippet to your build.gradle file:

```groovy
defaultConfig {
    //...

    manifestPlaceholders = [
            'appAuthRedirectScheme':'myapp'
    ]

    //...
    
    resValue "string", "firebase_database_url", "[YOUR DATABASE URL]"
}
```

Replace `[YOUR DATABASE URL]` with the actual database URL copied earlier. 

Note that for Android, you must specify a redirect scheme value for App Auth. Replace `myapp` with your own custom scheme value. 

Lastly, initialize the Firebase SDK within your app delegate:

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

  FirebaseApp.configure()
  
  return true
}
```

## Step 3: Add Device Tokens to Firebase Database
In order for your app to receive push notifications, it needs to obtain a registration token from the Firebase SDK and store it in your app's Firebase database. When a new device token is generated for a client app installation or update, the app should immediately save the token to its Firebase database. However, before doing so, the app should first ensure that the current user is authenticated with Firebase Authentication.

Here's an example implementation:

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
  guard let auth = Auth.auth(), let user = auth.currentUser else {
      print("User not signed in")
      return
  }

  DispatchQueue.main.async {
    let tokenString = deviceToken.map { String(format: "%02x", $0) }.joined()
    let remoteMessage = RemoteMessage(token: tokenString, data: [:], type:.unknown)
    FIRMessaging.messaging().shouldEstablishDirectChannel = true
    FIRMessaging.messaging().handleRemoteMessage(remoteMessage)

    // Save token to Firebase database after ensuring user is authenticated
    Database.database().reference().child("users/\(user.uid)/deviceTokens").child(tokenString).setValue(true) { error in
        if let error = error {
          print("Error saving device token:", error.localizedDescription)
        }
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, we check whether the user is currently signed in before attempting to generate a device token. If the user is signed in, we convert the binary data received from APNS into a readable format and pass it along to the Firebase Messaging SDK. We also set `shouldEstablishDirectChannel` to true, which tells the Firebase SDK to establish a direct channel to the APNS server even if a connection cannot be established quickly enough. Lastly, we attempt to save the device token to the `/users/<userId>/deviceTokens` child path in the Firebase database, assuming the user exists and has signed in successfully. Note that the `Database.database()` method returns a reference to the default Firebase Realtime Database instance, but you could customize the URL if necessary.

If the user is not signed in, we skip generating and saving the device token. It's better to fail silently here rather than interrupt the user experience, since failure to retrieve the device token may cause issues later during message delivery.

## Step 4: Implement Server Side Code to Generate User IDs and Send Messages
When a user first signs up or logs in, your app should generate a unique identifier for that user and store it somewhere persistent, such as the user's profile document in Firebase Firestore. You can then use that identifier when sending push notifications to individual users, instead of relying solely on topic subscriptions. To implement this functionality, follow these steps:

1. Generate User Identifiers and Store Them Persistently

You should use a unique identifier for every user that is stored separately from any personal information. One common approach is to concatenate fields like email address and phone number to form the user id. For example, suppose you store user profiles in a collection called "/users/" and the email field is named "email". Then you might generate user ids by concatenating the email field with something unique, like a random string or timestamp. Assuming you're using Firestore, you could store each user's id in the corresponding document in the /users/ collection.

2. Send Notification Messages Targeted at Individual Users

Suppose you want to notify a particular user whenever there's a new message in your chat room. Instead of subscribing to the entire "chatRooms" topic, you can subscribe only to the user's private subscription topic, defined by their user id. On the server side, once you've identified the target user by their user id, you can construct a notification message object with the desired payload and send it to their individual subscription topic using the Firebase Admin SDK. Here's an example implementation:

```javascript
const admin = require('firebase-admin');

// Initialize Firebase Admin SDK
admin.initializeApp();

// Get a reference to the Firebase Database
const db = admin.firestore().collection('/users');

exports.sendMessage = async function sendMessage(toUserId, title, body) {
  const fromUserId = getCurrentUserId(); // assume this retrieves the logged-in user's id

  try {
    const snapshot = await db.doc(`\(fromUserId)`).get();
    if (!snapshot.exists) {
      throw new Error('The sender does not exist.');
    }

    const tokensSnapshot = await db.doc(`\(toUserId)/deviceTokens`).get();
    if (!tokensSnapshot.exists ||!Array.isArray(tokensSnapshot.data())) {
      throw new Error('No valid device tokens found for recipient.');
    }

    const tokens = tokensSnapshot.data().filter((value, index, array) => value!== null && typeof value === 'boolean').map((value, index, array) => index);
    if (tokens.length == 0) {
      throw new Error('No valid device tokens found for recipient.');
    }

    const androidConfig = {
      notification: {
        title,
        body,
        icon: '[OPTIONAL ICON]',
      },
    };

    const apnsConfig = {
      headers: {
        'apns-priority': '10',
      },
      payload: {
        aps: {
          alert: {
            title,
            body,
          },
          badge: 1,
        },
      },
    };

    const message = {
      data: {},
      tokens,
      android: androidConfig,
      apns: apnsConfig,
    };

    await admin.messaging().sendMulticast(message);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
};
```

In this example, we assume that the `getCurrentUserId()` function returns the logged-in user's id, which helps us identify who the sender is. We first fetch the sender's profile document from the database using their user id (`db.doc('\(fromUserId)')`) and verify that it exists. Next, we fetch the recipient's device tokens from the database using their user id and filter out any invalid values (`if (value!== null && typeof value === 'boolean')`). Finally, we construct a notification message object with the desired payload and send it to all recipients using the Firebase Admin SDK's `messaging().sendMulticast()` method. Note that this assumes that the Firebase Admin credentials are configured properly on the server. Also note that the `title`, `body`, and optional `icon` parameters are passed as part of the `androidConfig` object. You'll likely want to customize these appropriately for your own use case.

## Step 5: Install Firebase SDK on Client Devices and Receive Notifications
Finally, you need to install the Firebase SDK on each client device where you want to allow receiving push notifications. For iOS, you can use Cocoapods to install the required pods and setup the Firebase SDK accordingly. Similarly, for Android, you can add the Firebase Gradle plugin to your gradle files and call the relevant methods in the activity lifecycle callbacks. During runtime, the Firebase SDK will handle automatically registering the device token with Firebase and establishing a direct channel to the APNS server to deliver push notifications. At that point, you can start listening for incoming push notifications by adding a listener to the `onMessage` event of the Firebase Messaging SDK.
