Microservices architecture has become one of the most popular architectural styles for building large-scale systems. It allows developers to create independent applications that can be deployed independently across multiple servers, reducing coupling and making it easier to manage updates and changes over time. However, microservices require careful planning and design as they involve complex interdependencies between services which can make them challenging to develop and maintain. 

In this article, we will explore how to build a simple microservice using Flask and asyncio library in Python. We will also learn about some fundamental concepts such as asynchronous programming and event loops used by these libraries. Finally, we will deploy our microservice on Kubernetes cluster and test its functionality. This is just an example of what you could do using Flask and asyncio. In real world scenarios, there are many other components involved like database connectivity, message queues, caching mechanisms etc., that need to be considered when building actual production-grade microservices.  

Prerequisites: You should have basic understanding of Python, RESTful APIs, HTTP protocols, web development, Docker containers, Kubernetes clusters, and networking basics. If you don’t already know any of these technologies or concepts, I suggest you spend some time learning them before proceeding further.


Let's start writing!

## 2.1 Asynchronous Programming
Asynchronous programming refers to the ability of a program to perform tasks without blocking the main thread. It enables concurrency in an application where different parts of the code execute concurrently while sharing common resources (e.g., memory) through non-blocking operations. The primary advantage of asynchronous programming lies in the reduced wait times and increased throughput compared to traditional synchronous programming models.

The two main approaches to achieving asynchronous programming in Python are callback functions and generators. Both of these methods allow us to defer execution of blocks of code until specific events occur. Callbacks provide a function pointer to another piece of code that gets executed once a certain action completes, whereas generators use yield statements to pause execution temporarily and resume later.

We'll use callbacks extensively throughout this tutorial to handle requests asynchronously. For more information about asynchronous programming in Python, check out [this excellent guide](https://realpython.com/async-io-python/) from RealPython.

## 2.2 Event Loop
An event loop is responsible for executing and scheduling tasks within a Python interpreter. When a task needs to run, it registers itself with the event loop and waits for instructions. Once an instruction is received, the corresponding coroutine executes up to the next await statement, suspending itself until data is available or a timeout occurs.

When running in async mode, each request handled by Flask enters into an event loop and schedules various tasks related to handling the request. These include the following: 

1. Handling incoming network requests
2. Parsing incoming request data (if applicable)
3. Validating user input (if applicable)
4. Executing business logic associated with the requested resource
5. Building the response object based on the result of the above steps
6. Sending the response back to the client
7. Closing down the connection gracefully after sending all the data

By default, Flask uses gevent, a high-performance coroutine-based Python networking library that provides support for asynchronous IO. Therefore, the core concept behind Flask and asyncio is the same - both frameworks leverage coroutines to enable asynchronous programming paradigm.

For additional details about event loops and their role in asynchronous programming, refer to the official documentation of the chosen web framework.

## 2.3 Coroutine vs. Task
A coroutine is essentially a lightweight thread of execution that runs sequentially but can be paused at any point and resumed later. Each coroutine belongs to only one task, which represents the unit of work being performed. A task may contain multiple coroutines, allowing the task to share contextual state among its members. Tasks can be thought of as threads but with added features like better error handling, synchronization primitives, and non-blocking io capabilities.

Here's an illustration of coroutines and tasks in Python:

![coroutines_tasks](./images/coroutine_vs_task.png)

In this figure, we see four instances of the `Task` class representing four separate processes running simultaneously. Each process contains three instances of the `Coroutine` class that are executed concurrently, sharing common state between themselves.

This type of parallelism can significantly improve performance, especially for long-running I/O operations or CPU-bound tasks, as it avoids the need for expensive synchronization primitives such as locks and mutexes.

## 2.4 Thread Pool Executor
A ThreadPoolExecutor manages a pool of worker threads that are reused to execute tasks asynchronously. When a new task is submitted, either a new thread is created if none are idle or an existing thread is reused. By default, the number of threads in the executor is equal to the number of processors on your machine.

To increase or decrease the size of the pool, you can call the `submit()` method on the executor instance directly or pass in a lambda function that creates a new thread every time a new task is needed. Here's an example usage:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import threading

executor = ThreadPoolExecutor() # defaults to number of processors on machine

def my_function(n):
    return n*n

future1 = executor.submit(my_function, 2) # submits a new task
future2 = executor.submit(lambda x:x**2, 3) # submits another task
result1 = future1.result() # waits for first task to complete and returns result
result2 = future2.result() # waits for second task to complete and returns result
print("Results:", result1, result2)

executor.shutdown() # terminates all workers in the pool
```

Note that calling `executor.shutdown()` ensures that all worker threads terminate and frees up system resources. In general, you should always call `shutdown()` when finished working with an executor to avoid leaking resources.

## 2.5 Kubernetes
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Using Kubernetes, we can easily scale out our microservices horizontally to handle increasing traffic, or roll out updates to fix bugs or add new features. Additionally, Kubernetes can monitor our microservices and automatically redeploy any failed nodes or pods to ensure high availability. To get started with Kubernetes, visit the official website for installation instructions or follow along with the tutorials provided by Google Cloud Platform.

## 3.1 Overview
Microservices are software architectures designed to isolate individual functionalities or services into small, modular pieces that can communicate with each other over well defined interfaces. They offer several benefits including ease of maintenance, scalability, fault tolerance, and agility. In this section, we will focus on building a sample microservice using Flask and asyncio library in Python. We will also talk about how asyncio works under the hood. Let's begin!

## 3.2 Creating a Simple Microservice
First, let's set up a virtual environment and install necessary dependencies: 

```bash
pipenv --python 3.7
pipenv shell
pip install flask aiohttp pyyaml jinja2 
```

Next, let's create a file called `app.py`, which will serve as our entrypoint for our microservice. We'll define our API endpoints here. Since we're creating a simple calculator service, we'll define two endpoints: `/add` and `/subtract`. Our implementation for each endpoint consists of simply returning the sum and difference of the two numbers passed as query parameters. 

```python
from aiohttp import web

routes = web.RouteTableDef()

@routes.get('/add')
async def add(request):
    num1 = int(request.query['num1'])
    num2 = int(request.query['num2'])
    total = num1 + num2
    return web.Response(text=str(total))


@routes.get('/subtract')
async def subtract(request):
    num1 = int(request.query['num1'])
    num2 = int(request.query['num2'])
    diff = num1 - num2
    return web.Response(text=str(diff))

app = web.Application()
app.add_routes(routes)

web.run_app(app, port=8080)
```

With this setup, we now have a very simple microservice with two endpoints - `/add` and `/subtract`. Now, let's look at how asyncio works under the hood.

### How does asyncio work?

Asyncio is built upon the concept of coroutines. A coroutine is a lightweight thread of execution that runs sequentially but can be paused at any point and resumed later. Unlike normal threads, coroutines can switch contexts frequently without interfering with each other and not block the whole program. Asyncio relies heavily on cooperative multitasking and coroutine switching.

Each coroutine belongs to only one task, which represents the unit of work being performed. A task may contain multiple coroutines, allowing the task to share contextual state among its members. Tasks can be thought of as threads but with added features like better error handling, synchronization primitives, and non-blocking io capabilities.

Asyncio introduces two main abstractions - `asyncio.Future` and `asyncio.EventLoop`. Futures represent the outcome of an asynchronous operation and behave similar to promises. Events loops are responsible for executing and scheduling tasks within an asyncio interpreter.

When running in async mode, each request handled by Flask enters into an event loop and schedules various tasks related to handling the request. These include the following:

1. Reading data from the network
2. Writing data to the network
3. Parsing incoming request data
4. Validating user input (if applicable)
5. Executing business logic associated with the requested resource
6. Building the response object based on the result of the above steps
7. Sending the response back to the client
8. Closing down the connection gracefully after sending all the data

The exact sequence of tasks depends on the nature of the request and the current state of the server. During processing, tasks may yield control to other tasks, giving the opportunity to other tasks to run.

Now, let's move on to deploying our microservice on Kubernetes cluster and testing its functionality.  

## 3.3 Deploying on Kubernetes Cluster

To deploy our microservice on Kubernetes, we need to package our code into a docker image and then push it to a remote registry so that Kubernetes can pull it. We can accomplish this using the Dockerfile below:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.7-slim-buster

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY Pipfile.
COPY Pipfile.lock.

RUN pip install pipenv && \
    pipenv install --system --deploy --ignore-pipfile

COPY app.py.

CMD ["uvicorn", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "app:app"]
```

In this Dockerfile, we specify the base image as `python:3.7-slim-buster` which includes a pre-built Python runtime with all commonly used packages installed. We copy over our source files (`app.py`) and install our dependencies (`Pipfile`). We use the `pipenv` tool to lock and install our dependencies in a deterministic manner. Finally, we launch our uvicorn ASGI server to listen for incoming connections. Note that we expose our service on port 8080, since Kubernetes expects services to listen on this port.

Once we've built our image, we can push it to a remote repository using the `docker push` command. Next, we need to configure Kubernetes to correctly deploy and manage our service. Here's an example YAML configuration file:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: calculator
  labels:
    app: calculator
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: calculator
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: calculator
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: calculator
        image: gcr.io/[PROJECT-ID]/calculator:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          protocol: TCP
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /healthz
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          periodSeconds: 10
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: calculator
  labels:
    app: calculator
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: calculator
```

In this config file, we create a deployment with two replicas of our container image. We select the appropriate pod using label selectors, and attach the volume mounts and ports required for our application. We also set up a healthcheck to verify that our service is running properly. Lastly, we create a load balancer service to distribute incoming traffic across our pods. Replace `[PROJECT-ID]` with your own GCP project ID.

Finally, we apply the configuration using the following commands:

```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes.yaml
```

After applying the configuration, Kubernetes will deploy our service onto our Kubernetes cluster and ensure that it stays operational. We can access our service by forwarding the local port to the corresponding port exposed by the service using the following command:

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/calculator 8080:8080
```

Now, we can send requests to our service using curl or a web browser. Here are some examples:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/add?num1=3&num2=4
curl http://localhost:8080/subtract?num1=9&num2=3
```

If everything was successful, we should receive the correct results.
