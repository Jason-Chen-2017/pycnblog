The core algorithm of the smart thermostat is designed to process data from various sensors and APIs to determine the optimal temperature settings. This section will provide a detailed explanation of the algorithm principles and specific operational steps using pseudocode.

### 3.1 Algorithm Principles

The smart thermostat algorithm operates based on the following principles:

1. **User Preferences**: The algorithm takes into account the user's preferred temperature settings and adjusts the temperature accordingly.
2. **Environmental Data**: The algorithm considers real-time environmental data, such as the outside temperature, humidity, and occupancy status.

### 3.2 Pseudocode

```plaintext
function adjustTemperature(preferredTemp, outsideTemp, humidity, occupancy):
    if occupancy is true:
        if outsideTemp is above preferredTemp:
            newTemp = preferredTemp - (outsideTemp - preferredTemp) * 0.1
        else:
            newTemp = preferredTemp + (preferredTemp - outsideTemp) * 0.1
    else:
        newTemp = preferredTemp - 2
    
    if humidity is above 80%:
        newTemp = newTemp - 1
    
    return newTemp
```

### 3.3 Operational Steps

## 4. Mathematical Models and Formulas

In the design of a smart thermostat, various mathematical models and formulas are used to determine the optimal temperature settings. This section will provide a detailed explanation of these models and formulas, along with examples.

### 4.1 Mathematical Models

The following mathematical models are used in the smart thermostat:

1. **Heat Transfer Model**: A model that describes the rate of heat transfer between the inside and outside environments.
2. **Humidity Adjustment Model**: A model that adjusts the temperature based on the relative humidity in the environment.
3. **Occupancy Detection Model**: A model that predicts the presence of occupants based on sensor data.

### 4.2 Detailed Explanation and Examples

#### 4.2.1 Heat Transfer Model

The heat transfer model uses the following formula to calculate the rate of heat transfer (Q) between the inside and outside environments:

\[ Q = U \times A \times (T_{out} - T_{in}) \]

Where:

- \( Q \): Rate of heat transfer (in watts)
- \( U \): Heat transfer coefficient (in watts per square meter per Kelvin)
- \( A \): Surface area of heat exchange (in square meters)
- \( T_{out} \): Outside temperature (in Kelvin)
- \( T_{in} \): Inside temperature (in Kelvin)

Example:

Given a heat transfer coefficient of 10 W/m²K, a surface area of 5 m², and an outside temperature of 15°C (288K) and inside temperature of 20°C (293K), the rate of heat transfer is:

\[ Q = 10 \times 5 \times (288 - 293) = -50 \text{ W} \]

This indicates that heat is transferring from the inside to the outside environment.

#### 4.2.2 Humidity Adjustment Model

The humidity adjustment model uses the following formula to adjust the temperature based on the relative humidity (RH):

\[ T_{adjusted} = T_{current} - (RH \times 0.1) \]

Where:

- \( T_{adjusted} \): Adjusted temperature (in Celsius)
- \( T_{current} \): Current temperature (in Celsius)
- \( RH \): Relative humidity (as a percentage)

Example:

Given a current temperature of 22°C and a relative humidity of 85%, the adjusted temperature is:

\[ T_{adjusted} = 22 - (85 \times 0.1) = 20.15 \text{°C} \]

#### 4.2.3 Occupancy Detection Model

The occupancy detection model uses a probability threshold to determine the presence of occupants based on sensor data. The formula is:

\[ occupancy = \frac{sensor\_data - threshold}{max\_value - threshold} \]

Where:

- \( occupancy \): Probability of occupancy (between 0 and 1)
- \( sensor\_data \): Sensor data (between 0 and max\_value)
- \( threshold \): A predefined threshold value (between 0 and max\_value)

Example:

Given a sensor data value of 75 and a threshold of 50, the probability of occupancy is:

\[ occupancy = \frac{75 - 50}{100 - 50} = 0.5 \]

This indicates a 50% chance of occupancy.

@app.route('/set_temp', methods=['POST'])
def set_temp():
    temp = request.form['temp']
    # Store the temperature preference in the database
    # Send a notification to the rule engine
    return jsonify({"status": "success", "temp": temp})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

#### 5.2.4 Rule Engine Service

The Rule Engine service processes data from the weather API, occupancy sensor, and user interface to determine the optimal temperature settings.

```python
def adjust_temperature(weather_data, occupancy, preferred_temp):
    outside_temp = weather_data['current']['temp_c']
    humidity = weather_data['current']['humidity']
    
    if occupancy:
        new_temp = preferred_temp - (outside_temp - preferred_temp) * 0.1
    else:
        new_temp = preferred_temp - 2
    
    if humidity > 80:
        new_temp = new_temp - 1
    
    return new_temp

if __name__ == '__main__':
    while True:
        # Fetch weather data from the weather API
        # Get occupancy status from the occupancy sensor
        # Get the preferred temperature from the user interface
        # Adjust the temperature using the adjust_temperature function
        # Send the new temperature setting to the thermostat
        time.sleep(60)
```

#### 5.2.5 Notification Service

The Notification service sends notifications to the user when the temperature needs adjustment or when there are any alerts.

```python
import pika

def send_notification(message):
    connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('localhost'))
    channel = connection.channel()
    channel.queue_declare(queue='notifications')
    channel.basic_publish(exchange='', routing_key='notifications', body=message)
    connection.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    while True:
        # Fetch the notification message from the rule engine
        # Send the notification to the user via email, SMS, or push notification
        time.sleep(60)
```
