Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular technique used for feature selection and dimensionality reduction. PCA identifies the directions that maximize the variance of the data and projects the data onto these new axes to reduce its dimensions while retaining as much information as possible. In this article, we will explore how to use PCA in Python to perform automatic feature selection. 

In the following sections, we will explain the basic concepts behind PCA, understand what is meant by principal components, implement PCA in Python using scikit-learn library, and evaluate the performance of PCA on various datasets with different sizes and complexity levels. Finally, we will conclude our findings and discuss potential future developments and challenges in PCA. Let's get started!

## 2.1 Introduction to PCA
Principal Component Analysis(PCA), also known as Principle Component Regression or Karhunen-Loeve Transform, is one of the most widely used techniques in Statistics and Machine Learning. It is used to transform high dimensional data into fewer number of uncorrelated variables called principal components which are linearly independent. This results in significant reduction of computational cost and it makes the dataset more manageable than the original dataset.

PCA performs two main tasks:
- Data pre-processing : It helps us in reducing the noise from the input data and removing redundant features from the data. The objective is to identify patterns and extract meaningful features out of given set of raw data points.
- Reducing Dimensionality : It reduces the problem of multi-collinearity amongst multiple attributes. By reducing the dimensions of the dataset into smaller number of uncorrelated variables we can avoid overfitting the model. We can achieve better accuracy in classification task if we have fewer dimensions to work with.

The goal of PCA is to find a transformation matrix $W$ such that the transformed data has maximum possible variance along each axis and no correlation between them. The direction of maximum variance gives us the first principal component (PC). If there exists another direction having higher variance then second PC is created. Similarly, further PCs can be constructed depending upon the amount of variance they capture. Thus, PCs represent the most important factors contributing towards the change in the output variable after accounting for variations due to other predictors present in the system.

## 2.2 Mathematical Formulation
Let $\mathbf{X}$ denote a sample matrix consisting of $n$ instances, each described by $p$ features. Suppose that all the columns in $\mathbf{X}$ are mutually uncorrelated with each other. Given a target vector $\mathbf{y}$, where $|{\mathbf{y}}|=n$, we want to minimize the mean squared error between predicted values and actual targets. Our optimization criterion will be:  

$$\min_{\mathbf{W}\in \mathbb{R}^{p\times p}} \sum_{i=1}^n ||\mathbf{X}_i - (\mathbf{X} \mathbf{W})_i||^2 + \lambda ||\mathbf{W}||^2,$$
where $||\cdot||^2$ represents the Euclidean norm of a vector and $\lambda >0$ is a regularization parameter that controls the tradeoff between minimizing the reconstruction error and maintaining the low-rank structure of the data. Here $\mathbf{X}_i$ represents the $i^{th}$ instance of the training set and $\mathbf{W}$ is the weight matrix obtained through PCA. We aim to project the training examples onto a lower rank subspace that captures the most information about the data. 

To solve the above optimization problem, we need to make use of eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix of $\mathbf{X}$. Recall that the covariance matrix $C(\mathbf{X}) = \frac{1}{n-1} \mathbf{X^\mathsf{T} X}$ measures the joint variation of the features and provides an estimate of the conditional dependency between any pair of features given the value of the remaining features. Eigendecomposition of $C(\mathbf{X})$ gives us the eigenvectors of the matrix $C(\mathbf{X})$ and their corresponding eigenvalues. Since the rows of $\mathbf{X}$ are linearly dependent, their covariances should be zero. Hence, only those eigenvectors corresponding to non-zero eigenvalues contribute to the PCA decomposition.

We formulate the optimization problem by fixing the weight matrix $\mathbf{W}$. To find the optimal weights, we take the derivative of the loss function with respect to the weights, set it equal to zero, and solve for the weights using numerical methods like gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent. However, since computing inverse of a large matrix might not be feasible, we instead use a QR decomposition algorithm to compute the weights efficiently.

Finally, we can calculate the projection error ($||\mathbf{X}-\hat{\mathbf{X}}\mathbf{W}||$) and choose the number of principal components based on the importance captured by each PC. Common practice is to retain only those PCs whose contribution is greater than some threshold level (usually, lesser than $1-\epsilon$). We can compute the cumulative explained variance ratio (CVR) of each PC until we obtain desired level of explained variance. 

## 2.3 Example Walkthrough
Suppose you have a dataset containing information about customers' income, age, education level, etc., and your goal is to segment the customers based on these criteria into three groups: low-income, medium-income, and high-income. You could begin by performing PCA on the entire dataset to identify the underlying patterns and trends, and selecting the subset of features that explain at least 90% of the variance in the data. This would result in the construction of three principal components that capture the highest degree of variation in the data. From here, you can examine the loadings of each component relative to the original features and determine whether certain features play a larger role in driving the variation within each group compared to others. For example, perhaps gender plays a larger role in determining differences between low-income vs. medium-income vs. high-income customers than does education level. Once you have identified the key features, you can construct models based solely on these features to identify clusters within each customer segment and classify customers accordingly.

## 3.1 Implementing PCA using scikit-learn Library
Scikit-learn is a popular machine learning library that provides efficient implementations of many common algorithms for data science tasks like clustering, regression, and classification. One of the most commonly used functions in Scikit-learn for PCA is `PCA`, which allows us to apply Principal Component Analysis to a dataset. Here is a brief overview of how to use `PCA` function from scikit-learn to perform automatic feature selection:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
import numpy as np

# Load the iris dataset
data = load_iris()
features = data['data']
target = data['target']

# Create a PCA object
pca = PCA(n_components=2)

# Fit the PCA object to the data
pca.fit(features)

# Get the reduced features
reduced_features = pca.transform(features)
print("Reduced shape:", reduced_features.shape)

# Calculate the percentage of variance explained by each principal component
explained_variance = pca.explained_variance_ratio_
print("Explained Variance Ratio", explained_variance)
```
This code loads the Iris dataset and applies PCA to it. We specify the number of principal components we want to keep (`n_components`), which is usually determined by finding the elbow point in the CVR curve. After fitting the PCA object to the data, we can retrieve the reduced features using the `transform()` method. We print both the reduced shape and the explained variance ratio of each principal component.

Note that PCA doesn't necessarily always improve performance compared to manual feature selection techniques, but it is often useful as a preprocessing step before applying more complex models. Additionally, PCA can help visualize the relationships between the features, making it easier to detect patterns and make sense of the data.

## 3.2 Evaluation of PCA Performance on Different Datasets
One way to measure the performance of PCA is to compare its results with the baseline approach of simply taking the top k features with the largest absolute coefficients in a linear model trained on the full dataset. Here is an implementation of this comparison:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Split the data into train and test sets
np.random.seed(42)
train_size = int(len(features)*0.7)
indices = np.arange(len(features))
np.random.shuffle(indices)
train_indices = indices[:train_size]
test_indices = indices[train_size:]
x_train = features[train_indices]
y_train = target[train_indices]
x_test = features[test_indices]
y_test = target[test_indices]

# Use logistic regression to select top k features
lr = LogisticRegression(penalty='none')
lr.fit(x_train, y_train)
coefs = lr.coef_[0]
top_k = np.argsort(-abs(coefs))[::-1][:2] #take top 2 features with highest magnitude coefficient

# Train a logistic regression classifier on the selected features
selected_features = x_train[:, top_k]
clf = LogisticRegression(penalty='l2', solver='liblinear')
clf.fit(selected_features, y_train)
pred = clf.predict(selected_features)
acc = accuracy_score(y_test, pred)
print('Top {} Features: {}'.format(len(top_k), ', '.join([str(i+1)+':'+str(c) for i, c in enumerate(coefs[top_k])])))
print('Accuracy:', acc)
```
This code splits the data into a training set and a testing set, and uses logistic regression to select the top k features based on their absolute coefficients. Then, it trains a logistic regression classifier on the selected features and evaluates its accuracy on the test set. Note that we use L2 penalty because the coefficients may have varying scales and regularization ensures that none of them dominate the overall prediction power of the model.

Next, let's evaluate the performance of PCA on a few real-world datasets.

### Dataset 1: California Housing Prices
The California housing prices dataset contains house sales prices for various locations in California. Each row corresponds to a district, and each column represents a feature like median income, total population, average rooms, etc. Here is an example of how to apply PCA to this dataset and evaluate its performance:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Load the California housing price dataset
data = fetch_california_housing()
features = data['data']
target = data['target']

# Apply PCA to the data
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
pca.fit(features)
reduced_features = pca.transform(features)

# Evaluate the performance of PCA on a CV split
scores = cross_val_score(LogisticRegression(), reduced_features, target, cv=5)
print("Cross-validation Accuracy: {:.2f}".format(scores.mean()))
```
This code loads the California housing pricing dataset, applies PCA to it, and evaluates its performance using a simple logistic regression model on a 5-fold CV split. We expect the score to be around 0.83-0.86 depending on the choice of hyperparameters. Notice that we don't need to worry about class imbalance issues because PCA doesn't affect the distribution of labels.

### Dataset 2: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic
The breast cancer wisconsin diagnostic dataset consists of several medical parameters such as biopsy site size, age, tumor shape, margin, texture, etc., and whether the patient has been diagnosed with breast cancer or not. Here is an example of how to apply PCA to this dataset and evaluate its performance:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Load the breast cancer dataset
data = load_breast_cancer()
features = data['data']
target = data['target']
names = data['feature_names']

# Apply PCA to the data
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
pca.fit(features)
reduced_features = pca.transform(features)

# Evaluate the performance of PCA on a stratified 5-fold CV split
skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5)
accuracies = []
for idx in skf.split(reduced_features, target):
    train_idx, test_idx = idx
    clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()
    clf.fit(reduced_features[train_idx], target[train_idx])
    pred = clf.predict(reduced_features[test_idx])
    accuracies.append(accuracy_score(target[test_idx], pred))
print("Stratified K-fold CV Accuracies:", [round(a, 2) for a in accuracies])
print("Mean Accuracy: {:.2f}%".format(np.mean(accuracies)))
```
This code loads the breast cancer dataset, applies PCA to it, and evaluates its performance using a decision tree classifier on a stratified 5-fold CV split. We expect the scores to be around 0.93-0.95. Again, notice that we don't need to worry about class imbalance issues because PCA doesn't affect the distribution of labels.

### Dataset 3: Diabetes Dataset
The diabetes dataset consists of several medical parameters such as age, blood pressure, insulin, BMI, and glucose levels, and whether the person has been diagnosed with diabetes or not. Here is an example of how to apply PCA to this dataset and evaluate its performance:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Load the diabetes dataset
data = load_diabetes()
features = data['data']
target = data['target']

# Apply PCA to the data
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
pca.fit(features)
reduced_features = pca.transform(features)

# Perform a grid search to optimize hyperparameters of random forest regressor
param_grid = {'max_depth': [None, 2, 4, 8, 16]}
rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)
grid_search = GridSearchCV(rf, param_grid=param_grid, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error')
grid_search.fit(reduced_features, target)
best_params = grid_search.best_params_
print("Best Parameters:", best_params)
```
This code loads the diabetes dataset, applies PCA to it, and optimizes hyperparameters of a random forest regressor using a grid search on a 5-fold CV split. We expect the optimized depth to be somewhere between 2 and 16, depending on the particular run. Again, notice that we don't need to worry about the scale of the features because PCA automatically centers and normalizes the data before computing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
