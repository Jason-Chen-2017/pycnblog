Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning algorithm that learns to make decisions in situations by trial and error. The goal of RL is to learn an optimal policy for the agent to take actions in different environments according to the reward received from the environment and the past action taken by it. In this article we will introduce key concepts in RL, discuss core algorithms with examples, provide code implementations and interpretations. Additionally, we will cover future development trends and challenges faced by RL researchers in industrial applications and business settings as well as practical tips on how to use RL in real-world problems. Finally, we will include commonly asked questions and their answers at the end.

## Key Features and Benefits of Reinforcement Learning
Key features of reinforcement learning are its ability to solve complex decision making problems and imitate behavioral patterns of animals, humans and machines. It also has several desirable properties like adaptability, autonomy, curiosity and exploration, which makes it particularly suitable for robotics, medical diagnosis and treatment, and many other areas where we need to achieve complex behaviors or optimize performance over long periods of time.

1. Policy Gradient Methods: These methods involve training agents using gradient descent optimization techniques to find the best policies for solving tasks. They have shown impressive results across various domains such as Atari games, Go, chess and Go-Explore. In this method, the policy function is learned as a neural network parameterized by a weight vector theta, which maps observations x to probability distributions over actions π(a|x;theta). Policy gradient approaches can be used to train both single-agent and multi-agent systems, but they often require more data than traditional supervised learning due to the exploratory nature of reinforcement learning.

2. Q-learning: This approach involves estimating the expected return for each state-action pair based on a current value function V(s), known as the Q function. By updating the parameters of the Q function towards better estimates, we learn a good policy that maximizes the expected rewards while taking into account the uncertainties induced by the stochastic nature of the environment. Common variants of Q-learning include Double Q-learning, Dueling Networks, and N-step bootstrapping.

3. Deep Reinforcement Learning: Neural networks have proven to be effective in deep reinforcement learning, enabling them to learn complex nonlinear functions. A popular architecture called Deep Q Network (DQN) combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with a Q-network model. Similarly, AlphaGo Zero uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) along with deep neural networks to play competitive board games at scale. Other recent advancements in deep reinforcement learning include Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) and Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (MADDPG).

Overall, reinforcement learning offers a flexible framework for developing intelligent agents that can learn new skills and strategies through trial and error without any external instructions or feedback. With its wide range of applications, industry giants like Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon have employed RL technologies to improve customer experience, drive stock prices, automate warehouse logistics, and manage production lines. However, there remain challenges ahead, including scalability issues, high sample complexity, limited interpretability, and biased optimization toward simple models. Nonetheless, reinforcement learning remains a promising area of research and development and we may see significant advances in coming years.

# 2. Basic Concepts
Before diving into specific algorithms, let's first understand some basic principles behind reinforcement learning.

1. Markov Decision Process (MDP): MDP is a sequential decision-making process that describes a system’s dynamics as an infinite horizon game between an agent and the environment. We assume that the agent interacts with the environment only through its own action space and receives immediate rewards in response to its actions. The transition probabilities P(s′|s,a) describe the conditional distribution of states s′ that the agent experiences after selecting action a given state s. The discount factor γ specifies the importance of future rewards relative to immediate ones. The MDP defines the problem of finding the optimal policy π* that maximizes the cumulative reward R of being in any state starting from any initial state.

2. Value Functions and Bellman Equations: Value functions define the utility or satisfaction of each possible state under a given policy. For a given state s and action a, the value function v(s) returns the expected return if the agent follows the optimal policy pi*: v(s)=E[R_t+1]∝π*(s_t,a_t)+γv(s_{t+1}), where R_t denotes the total reward obtained up to time step t, s_t denotes the state at time step t, a_t denotes the action selected at time step t, and v(s_{t+1}) denotes the value function at the next state s_{t+1}. Bellman equations describe the recursive solution to compute these value functions iteratively by considering the current and subsequent states and actions.

3. Reward Hypothesis: One assumption made in reinforcement learning is that all rewards are non-discounted. In practice, this leads to unexpected behavior because people tend to act irrationally and seek short-term rewards. To alleviate this issue, Gibbs or UCB algorithms offer dynamic programming solutions to update the value function based on sampled transitions instead of true ones. Alternatively, off-policy algorithms such as Q-learning and Sarsa can bootstrap from other policies to correct errors caused by following suboptimal trajectories during training.

4. Policy Iteration and Value Iteration: Policy iteration is a widely used technique to find the optimal policy within an MDP. Starting from random policies, alternately optimizing the value function and computing the corresponding policy until convergence. Value iteration simplifies computation by replacing the entire policy evaluation with a few iterations over the MDP. Both methods converge to the same answer but one requires less computational resources per iteration.

5. Exploration vs Exploitation: The tradeoff between exploiting knowledge gained from past experiences and exploring unexplored regions of the state space is fundamental to reinforcement learning. In fact, the exploration/exploitation dilemma can be seen as a two-player zero-sum game between the agent and an adversary who chooses the next move. Intuitively, we want to exploit our knowledge so as to maximize our expected reward, but we must also explore novel situations to prevent our agent from getting trapped in local minima. Epsilon-greedy and softmax exploration strategies can help balance these competing objectives.

6. Convergence Proofs: Many RL algorithms rely on empirical optimization techniques and suffer from instabilities when the MDP changes significantly over time. Standard guarantees like convergence bounds typically apply only to specific classes of MDPs and environments. Assumptions like convexity or stationarity can also prove beneficial for certain problems. Moreover, recently, theoretical analysis shows that value iteration can always find the global optimum even if the MDP is highly non-convex.


# 3. Core Algorithms and Examples

In this section, we'll look at three core algorithms - policy gradient methods, Q-learning, and deep reinforcement learning - and give example code implementations for each. 

### 3.1 Policy Gradient Methods
Policy gradient methods involve training an agent to select actions based on a probabilistic policy represented as a neural network parameterized by weights. Instead of directly optimizing the value function, policy gradient methods approximate the gradient of the expected return with respect to the policy parameters. Mathematically, the policy gradients are computed as ∇J(θ), where J(θ) is the mean squared error between the actual returns experienced by the agent and the predicted returns based on the current policy. The policy updates are then performed using standard stochastic gradient descent techniques.

Here's an implementation of REINFORCE algorithm in PyTorch:

```python
import torch
import gym

env = gym.make('CartPole-v0') # create the environment

n_inputs = env.observation_space.shape[0] # number of input dimensions
n_actions = env.action_space.n # number of output dimensions

model = torch.nn.Sequential(
    torch.nn.Linear(n_inputs, 128), # hidden layer
    torch.nn.ReLU(),
    torch.nn.Linear(128, n_actions), # output layer
    torch.nn.Softmax()
)

optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())

def calculate_returns(rewards, gamma=0.99):
    """ Calculate the returns based on the rewards obtained. """
    returns = []
    ret = 0

    for r in reversed(rewards):
        ret = r + gamma * ret
        returns.insert(0, ret)

    returns = torch.tensor(returns)
    returns = (returns - returns.mean()) / (returns.std() + eps)
    
    return returns

def train():
    obs, done, ep_reward = env.reset(), False, 0
    while not done:

        logits = model(torch.from_numpy(obs)) # forward pass through the network
        
        probs = torch.distributions.Categorical(logits=logits) # get the probabilities for each action

        action = probs.sample().item() # choose an action from the probability distribution

        next_obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action) # perform the action

        episode_rewards.append(reward) # append the reward to the list of rewards

        optimizer.zero_grad()

        # Compute the log probability of the chosen action
        log_prob = probs.log_prob(torch.tensor([action]))

        # Get the predicted return for the previous observation
        pred_return = model(torch.from_numpy(next_obs)).detach()[action].squeeze()

        # Compute the advantage estimate using TD(0)
        advantage = pred_return - values[-1][action]

        loss = -(log_prob * advantage).mean() # backpropogate the loss

        loss.backward() # update the gradients

        optimizer.step() # perform the SGD update

        obs = next_obs
        ep_reward += reward
        
    total_episode_rewards.append(ep_reward)

total_episode_rewards = []
for i_episode in range(1000):
    train()
    print("Episode {}: Mean reward {}".format(i_episode, sum(total_episode_rewards)/len(total_episode_rewards)))
    
env.close()
```

The above code implements the vanilla REINFORCE algorithm with baseline estimation, which computes the predicted return for the previous observation and subtracts it from the actual return to obtain an advantage estimate. Baseline estimation helps reduce the variance of the gradient estimator and accelerate the convergence rate of the algorithm.

### 3.2 Q-Learning
Q-learning is another classical algorithm in reinforcement learning. Like policy gradient methods, it maintains a value function approximated as a linear combination of observed states and actions. Unlike policy gradient methods, Q-learning does not directly optimize the policy function and relies on online interaction with the environment to gradually build up a dataset of experience tuples {(s, a, r, s')} which it then uses to update the value function. Each tuple represents a transition between two consecutive states undertaken by an agent and receiving a scalar reward.

Here's an implementation of Q-learning in TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import gym

env = gym.make('CartPole-v0') # create the environment

n_inputs = env.observation_space.shape[0] 
n_outputs = env.action_space.n

X = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, n_inputs]) # placeholders for the inputs and outputs
actions = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, [None])
Y = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None])

layer1 = tf.layers.dense(inputs=X, units=10, activation=tf.nn.relu, kernel_initializer=tf.random_normal_initializer(0.,.1))
logits = tf.layers.dense(inputs=layer1, units=n_outputs, kernel_initializer=tf.random_normal_initializer(0.,.1))
Q_pred = tf.reduce_sum(tf.multiply(logits, tf.one_hot(actions, depth=n_outputs)), axis=1)

loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(Y - Q_pred))
train_op = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=0.01).minimize(loss)

init = tf.global_variables_initializer()

sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(init)

episodes = 1000

for i_episode in range(episodes):
    rewards = []
    obsv = env.reset()

    while True:
        feed_dict = {X: obsv.reshape(1, n_inputs)}

        Q_val = sess.run(Q_pred, feed_dict={X: obsv.reshape(1, n_inputs)})

        action = np.argmax(Q_val)

        next_obsv, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)

        X_next = np.array([[reward, next_obsv[0], next_obsv[1], next_obsv[2], next_obsv[3]]]).T

        y_val = sess.run(Q_pred, feed_dict={X: X_next}).ravel()

        _, loss_val = sess.run([train_op, loss], feed_dict={X: obsv.reshape(1, n_inputs), Y: y_val, actions: [action]})

        obsv = next_obsv

        rewards.append(reward)

        if done:
            break

    print('Episode:', i_episode, 'Reward:', sum(rewards), 'Loss:', loss_val)

env.close()
```

The above code demonstrates how to implement Q-learning with a fully connected neural network and cross-entropy loss function. You should note that Q-learning is prone to the "bias against positive" effect, where it prefers to pick large negative numbers before large positive numbers. To address this issue, you could try adding the maximum entropy term to the objective function, which encourages exploration in the early stages of training:

```python
loss -= beta * tf.reduce_mean(-tf.reduce_sum(tf.exp(logits) * logits, axis=-1))
```

where `beta` controls the strength of the regularization term.

### 3.3 Deep Reinforcement Learning
Deep reinforcement learning involves combining deep neural networks with reinforcement learning algorithms to solve complex decision making problems. DQN, A3C, and DDPG are three famous examples of deep reinforcement learning algorithms that combine neural networks with either Q-learning or actor-critic methods respectively. Here's an implementation of DQN in TensorFlow:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
import gym
from collections import deque

env = gym.make('CartPole-v0')

class ReplayBuffer:
    def __init__(self, buffer_size):
        self.buffer_size = buffer_size
        self.buffer = deque()

    def add(self, experience):
        if len(self.buffer) > self.buffer_size:
            self.buffer.popleft()
        self.buffer.append(experience)

    def sample(self, batch_size):
        idx = np.random.choice(np.arange(len(self.buffer)), size=batch_size, replace=False)
        return [self.buffer[ii] for ii in idx]

class DQNAgent:
    def __init__(self, lr, epsilon, gamma, n_actions, input_dims, fc1_dims, fc2_dims):
        self.lr = lr
        self.epsilon = epsilon
        self.gamma = gamma
        self.input_dims = input_dims
        self.fc1_dims = fc1_dims
        self.fc2_dims = fc2_dims
        self.n_actions = n_actions
        self.memory = ReplayBuffer(100000)
        self.q_eval = self._build_dqn()

    def _build_dqn(self):
        input_ph = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None, self.input_dims))
        X = tf.layers.dense(input_ph, units=self.fc1_dims, activation=tf.nn.relu)
        X = tf.layers.dense(X, units=self.fc2_dims, activation=tf.nn.relu)
        q_values = tf.layers.dense(X, units=self.n_actions, activation=None)

        return q_values

    def remember(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        self.memory.add((state, action, reward, next_state, done))

    def choose_action(self, observation):
        if np.random.rand() < self.epsilon:
            action = np.random.randint(0, self.n_actions)
        else:
            q_value = self.q_eval.eval(feed_dict={self.X: observation[np.newaxis,:]})
            action = np.argmax(q_value)
        return action

    def learn(self):
        batch = self.memory.sample(batch_size=128)
        states = np.array([each[0] for each in batch])
        actions = np.array([each[1] for each in batch])
        rewards = np.array([each[2] for each in batch])
        dones = np.array([each[4] for each in batch])
        next_states = np.array([each[3] for each in batch])

        q_target = self.q_eval.eval(feed_dict={self.X: next_states})
        q_target_max = np.max(q_target, axis=1)
        q_target_selected = rewards + self.gamma*(1-dones)*q_target_max

        eval_act_vals = self.q_eval.eval(feed_dict={self.X: states})
        mask = np.zeros((128, self.n_actions))
        indices = np.array([i for i in range(128)])
        mask[[indices],[actions]] = 1
        q_pred = np.sum(mask * eval_act_vals, axis=1)

        cost = ((q_target_selected - q_pred)**2).mean()
        self.optimizer.minimize(session=self.sess, feed_dict={self.X: states, self.y: q_target_selected})

        if self.epsilon > 0.1:
            self.epsilon *= 0.999
