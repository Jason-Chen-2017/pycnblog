# 2.1 Introduction to Docker 
Docker is a lightweight virtualization technology designed to simplify the process of creating, managing, and delivering software applications. The key feature of Docker is its ability to package an application along with all its dependencies inside a small image file called a "container". Containers share the same kernel with the host system but have their own isolated filesystem. This means that each container runs in isolation from other containers and the underlying operating system. 

The main purpose of Docker is to create portable environments that can run anywhere, whether on premise or in the cloud. Developers can use Docker to build, ship, and run applications quickly without worrying about setting up complex environments or installing dependencies. The benefits of Docker include faster development cycles, improved quality, and better collaboration among developers. Docker provides support for building and sharing applications across platforms with ease, making it one of the most popular containerization technologies in recent years. 

To begin with, let us review some basic Docker terms:

1. Images: A Docker image is a read-only template used to create containers. It contains everything needed to run an application - code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, etc. Docker images are built from Dockerfile which specifies the steps to assemble the image. 

2. Containers: A Docker container is a runtime instance of an image. Each container is isolated and has its own set of resources allocated. Multiple containers can exist at once on the same machine and communicate with each other through well-defined APIs. 

3. Volumes: Docker volumes provide a way to persist data generated by containers even after the container exits. They are useful for storing application configuration files, caches, and any other data that you want to keep beyond the lifetime of a container. 

4. Networks: Docker networks provide a way to connect multiple containers together within a single or across multiple machines. You can specify network settings like DNS servers, subnet mask, routing rules, and firewall policies.  

Overall, Docker offers several advantages over traditional virtualization techniques, including faster boot times, smaller resource footprint, and easier maintenance. These features make Docker ideal for developing, testing, and shipping cloud native applications that require fast iteration and rapid release cycles. 


# 2.2 Multi Server Deployment

When we think of deploying an application across multiple servers, it usually refers to having two or more identical copies of the same application running on different physical or virtual machines. Traditionally, when we wanted to do this, we either installed the same copy of the application on every server manually or copied the entire disk onto the new server and then configured it accordingly. However, with Docker, we don't need to perform manual installation and configuration tasks since Docker takes care of all those details internally. This makes it much simpler and less error prone to handle multiple instances of our application across multiple servers. 

Therefore, there are three primary reasons why Docker becomes particularly interesting when it comes to deploying applications across multiple servers:

1. Scalability: Docker allows you to easily scale out your application by adding additional servers, without affecting the performance of existing ones. You can add or remove servers dynamically depending on the demand and availability of services.

2. Isolation: Since each Docker container shares the same kernel with the host system, containers offer true virtualization. Any modifications made to a container only impact itself, ensuring that each container runs in an isolated environment. Therefore, you can safely run different versions of the same application simultaneously on the same server without interfering with each other.

3. Environmental Reusability: Docker simplifies the task of maintaining consistent development and production environments by allowing you to save and reuse the same Docker images on different servers. This saves time and effort while also minimizing the risk of errors due to mismatched configurations.


# 3. Scaling Docker Containers Across Multiple Servers

Scaling a Docker container involves launching additional instances of the same container on separate hosts or nodes. Depending on the infrastructure being used, you might be able to do this simply by adding more hardware resources (such as CPUs, memory, storage), or you may need to install and configure additional software packages or scripts to achieve horizontal scalability. Let's look at several ways to horizontally scale Docker containers across multiple servers.

## 3.1 Using Docker Compose

One of the easiest ways to scale Docker containers is to use Docker Compose, which is a tool that helps you define and run multi-container Docker applications. With Docker Compose, you can define multiple containers in a YAML file and spin them up all at once with a single command. Here's what a sample `docker-compose.yml` file looks like:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    # Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
    image: node:latest
    # Set the working directory
    working_dir: /app
    # Expose port 3000 to the outside world
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    # Copy the app folder contents into the container
    volumes:
      -.:/app
    # Run npm start script
    entrypoint: ["npm", "start"]

  db:
    image: postgres:9.4
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    env_file:
      -./db/.env
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    restart: always

volumes:
  pgdata:
```

In this example, we're defining two services - a `web` service and a `db` service. The `web` service uses the latest version of the official Node.js runtime as a base image, exposes port 3000 to the outside world, maps the current directory to `/app`, sets the working directory, and runs the `npm start` command when the container starts. The `db` service uses PostgreSQL 9.4 as the database engine, exposes port 5432 to the outside world, loads environment variables from the `./db/.env` file, persists data to a volume named `pgdata`, and automatically restarts the container if it crashes.

Once you've defined your Docker Compose configuration, you can start the services with a single command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This builds the Docker images specified in the `Dockerfile` files, creates the necessary containers, and links them together so that they can communicate with each other. By default, Docker Compose logs output from both the `web` and `db` containers to the terminal, but you can customize the logging behavior by editing the `docker-compose.yml` file. Once the services are up and running, you can access your application at http://localhost:3000. If you modify the source code locally, you can rebuild the Docker image and redeploy the changes by running the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build --detach
```

This stops the currently running containers, builds the updated images, spins up fresh containers, and connects them with the previously created network connections.

Another advantage of using Docker Compose is that it supports dynamic scaling, meaning that you can change the number of replicas for a given service by modifying its configuration and running the `up` command again. For example, if you need to increase the number of `web` service replicas to accommodate increased traffic, you can edit the `docker-compose.yml` file and update the value of the `replicas` parameter under the `web` section. Similarly, if you want to remove an extra replica temporarily or permanently, you can adjust the value of the `scale` parameter under the corresponding service definition in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## 3.2 Using Kubernetes

Kubernetes (K8s) is another popular platform for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts. K8s defines several abstractions such as pods, replication controllers, services, and namespaces that help you manage your application deployments. There are many different ways to deploy Kubernetes clusters, ranging from cloud-based managed solutions to self-managed bare metal servers.

Here's an overview of how to use Kubernetes to deploy and manage Docker containers:

1. Install kubectl: The Kubernetes command-line tool (`kubectl`) is required to interact with your K8s cluster. You can download and install it on your local machine by following the instructions here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl.

2. Create a Kubernetes Cluster: Before you can deploy containers on your K8s cluster, you must first create one. There are several options for doing this, including using hosted solutions such as Google Cloud Platform, AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Digital Ocean.

3. Deploy Your Application: To deploy your Docker container on K8s, you need to create a Kubernetes Deployment object. Here's an example manifest for deploying a simple nginx container:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: my-nginx
     labels:
       app: my-nginx
   spec:
     replicas: 2
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: my-nginx
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: my-nginx
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: nginx
           image: nginx:1.7.9
           ports:
             - containerPort: 80
   ```

   This deployment defines a label selector that matches the pod templates created by the deployment. When you apply this deployment to your cluster, K8s will create two replicas of the `nginx` container behind a service endpoint.

4. Scale Your Application: To scale your application vertically or horizontally, you can modify the `replicas` field in the deployment manifest. Alternatively, you can use the K8s API directly to adjust the number of replicas programmatically.

5. Monitor and Troubleshoot Your Application: Monitoring and troubleshooting your application on K8s typically involves checking the status of individual pods and analyzing log messages. Kubectl provides various commands for inspecting objects in the cluster, including `get`, `describe`, and `logs`. You can also use external monitoring systems such as Prometheus and Grafana to gather metrics and visualizations for your cluster and workload.

## 3.3 Using Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)

Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a fully managed container management solution known as Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS). AWS ECS is highly integrated with other AWS services like EC2, ELB, IAM, and S3, and enables you to easily run Docker containers on EC2 instances. Here's how to use AWS ECS to deploy and manage Docker containers:

1. Launch an ECS Cluster: To get started, you must launch an ECS cluster. Choose an EC2 instance type, desired instance count, and VPC/subnet combination that suits your needs. You can also attach additional storage and networking resources to your cluster if necessary.

2. Register Your Task Definition: To deploy a Docker container on ECS, you need to register a task definition that describes the container(s) and the parameters to run them with. Here's an example task definition for a simple nginx container:

   ```json
   {
     "family": "my-nginx",
     "taskRoleArn": "",
     "networkMode": "awsvpc",
     "containerDefinitions": [
       {
         "name": "nginx",
         "image": "nginx:1.7.9",
         "portMappings": [{
            "hostPort": 80,
            "protocol": "tcp",
            "containerPort": 80
          }]
        }
     ],
     "requiresCompatibilities": [
       "EC2"
     ],
     "cpu": "256",
     "memory": "512",
     "executionRoleArn": ""
   }
   ```

   This task definition launches a single `nginx` container with a public facing HTTP port exposed on port 80. You can customize this definition to fit your particular needs.

3. Run Your Task: After registering your task definition, you can run your container on ECS by creating a service that targets the task definition. Here's an example service definition:

   ```json
   {
     "cluster": "<your-cluster>",
     "serviceName": "my-nginx",
     "taskDefinition": "my-nginx",
     "loadBalancers": [],
     "desiredCount": 2,
     "launchType": "FARGATE",
     "platformVersion": "LATEST",
     "healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds": 60
   }
   ```

   This service launches two tasks with the registered `my-nginx` task definition behind a load balancer. Fargate is AWS' proprietary implementation of the Docker container execution interface. Under the hood, Fargate manages the provisioning, scheduling, and elasticity of containers on EC2 instances.

4. Update Your Service: To update the configuration of your service, such as changing the CPU or memory allocation, you can modify the associated task definition and apply it to the service again. You can also use the AWS Management Console or CLI to monitor and troubleshoot your service.

Overall, AWS ECS provides a cost effective and flexible option for managing Docker containers across multiple servers.
