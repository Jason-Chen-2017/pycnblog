### Gröbner basis

Gröbner basis is a fundamental concept in computational algebraic geometry. Given an ideal I in a polynomial ring R, a Gröbner basis B of I is a particular generating set of I such that the multidegree of polynomials in B forms a well-ordering. Gröbner bases have many applications in algebraic geometry, coding theory, cryptography, and robotics.

The computation of Gröbner bases involves the Buchberger algorithm or its variants, which involve repeatedly selecting a pair of polynomials from the ideal, computing their S-polynomial, and reducing it by the current basis. The algorithm terminates when no more reductions are possible.

In Singular, we can compute Gröbner bases using the `std` function:
```singular
ring r = 0, x(3), dp;
ideal i = x1^2 + x2*x3 - x1*x3, x2^3 - x1^2*x3;
list L = std(i);
```
In Macaulay2, we can compute Gröbner bases using the `gb` function:
```scss
R = QQ[x1,x2,x3];
I = ideal(x1^2 + x2*x3 - x1*x3, x2^3 - x1^2*x3);
G = gb I;
```
In CoCoA, we can compute Gröbner bases using the `Basis` function:
```csharp
Use MYRING := QQ[x1,x2,x3];
I := Ideal(x1^2 + x2*x3 - x1*x3, x2^3 - x1^2*x3);
G := Basis(I);
```

### Primary decomposition

Primary decomposition is a technique for decomposing an ideal into finitely many primary ideals. A primary ideal is an ideal whose radical is prime. Primary decomposition has applications in algebraic geometry, coding theory, and cryptography.

The computation of primary decomposition involves finding associated primes, isolating components, and computing radicals. In Singular, we can compute primary decomposition using the `decompose` function:
```singular
ring r = 0, x(3), dp;
ideal i = x1^2 + x2*x3 - x1*x3, x2^3 - x1^2*x3;
list L = decompose(i);
```
In Macaulay2, we can compute primary decomposition using the `primaryDecomposition` function:
```scss
R = QQ[x1,x2,x3];
I = ideal(x1^2 + x2*x3 - x1*x3, x2^3 - x1^2*x3);
L = primaryDecomposition I;
```
In CoCoA, we can compute primary decomposition using the `PrimaryDecomposition` function:
```csharp
Use MYRING := QQ[x1,x2,x3];
I := Ideal(x1^2 + x2*x3 - x1*x3, x2^3 - x1^2*x3);
L := PrimaryDecomposition(I);
```

### Computing the Hilbert series of an ideal

The Hilbert series of an ideal is a generating function that encodes information about the graded structure of the ideal. Computing the Hilbert series of an ideal is useful in algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and representation theory.

We can compute the Hilbert series of an ideal using the following steps:

1. Compute a Gröbner basis for the ideal.
2. Define a function to count the number of monomials of degree d in the quotient ring modulo the ideal.
3. Use the function to compute the first few terms of the Hilbert series.
4. Compute the limit of the ratio of successive terms of the Hilbert series.

Here is an example of computing the Hilbert series of an ideal in Singular:
```singular
ring r = 0, x(3), dp;
ideal i = x1^2 + x2*x3 - x1*x3, x2^3 - x1^2*x3;
list L = std(i);
int dim = nvars(i)-1;
int N = 10; // number of terms to compute
int d;
list hilbertSeries;
for (d=0; d<=N; d++) {
  int k = binomial(dim+d, d);
  list mons;
  for (int j=1; j<=k; j++) {
     int deg = weightVector(j, variables(r));
     if (j != degrees(monomials(i)) && !inList(monomial(j), monomials(i))) {
        mons = insert(monomial(j), mons);
     }
  }
  hilbertSeries = insert(size(mons)/k, hilbertSeries);
}
list coefficients;
for (d=1; d<size(hilbertSeries); d++) {
  coefficients = insert((hilbertSeries[d]-hilbertSeries[d-1])/d, coefficients);
}
ring s = 0, t(1), ds;
poly H = sum(coefficients)*t;
H; // the Hilbert series
limit(series(H,t),t=0); // the limit of the ratio of successive terms
```
Here is an example of computing the Hilbert series of an ideal in Macaulay2:
```scss
R = QQ[x1,x2,x3];
I = ideal(x1^2 + x2*x3 - x1*x3, x2^3 - x1^2*x3);
gb I;
dimension I;
N = 10; // number of terms to compute
d;
R1 = QQ[t];
H = sum (d -> (degree I choose d) * t^d, d, 0..N) / (1-t)^(dimension I);
H; // the Hilbert series
(series H)(0); // the limit of the ratio of successive terms
```
Here is an example of computing the Hilbert series of an ideal in CoCoA:
```css
Use MYRING := QQ[x1,x2,x3];
I := Ideal(x1^2 + x2*x3 - x1*x3, x2^3 - x1^2*x3);
Basis(I);
dimension I;
N := 10; // number of terms to compute
R1 := QQ[t];
H := sum ((d,m) -> if d = 0 then 1 else binomial(dimension I + d, d) * t^d, degree I, 0..N) / (1-t)^(dimension I);
H; // the Hilbert series
(series H)(0); // the limit of the ratio of successive terms
```

We can also use these systems to study cyclic codes, Reed-Solomon codes, and other important codes in coding theory.
