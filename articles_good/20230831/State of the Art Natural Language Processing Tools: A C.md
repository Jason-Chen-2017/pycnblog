# 1.简介
  

Natural language processing (NLP) has become a crucial component in various application domains such as speech recognition, text-based chatbots, information retrieval, and document understanding. There are many open-source NLP tools available for developers to build their applications with ease. In this article we will review several popular NLP libraries and frameworks, highlight key features they provide, and discuss some limitations that need further research. We also briefly compare the performance and usage of these tools on different datasets, which will help us determine our choice among them based on our specific requirements. Overall, this article aims to provide an overview of state-of-the-art natural language processing tools and identify potential strengths and weaknesses of each library or framework depending upon our needs. 

# 2.基本概念、术语说明
We will first define some basic terms and concepts used in this review before moving into the technical details of each tool.

1. Tokenization: The process of splitting a sentence into words, phrases, or other meaningful elements is known as tokenization. It involves breaking down the input text into smaller units called tokens which can be later processed by NLP algorithms. 

2. Stopwords removal: This refers to the process of removing common English words from a given text. These stopwords typically do not add any significant meaning to the text and hence they can be safely removed without losing valuable information. 

3. Stemming: The process of reducing words to their base form is known as stemming. For example, "running", "run", "runner" would all be reduced to the root word "run". Although it may not always produce accurate results, it helps in reducing the number of unique words in the corpus. 

4. Lemmatization: Another way to reduce words to their root form is through lemmatization. Unlike stemming, which only removes suffixes, lemmatization uses part of speech tagging techniques to map words to their appropriate parts of speech and then reduces those words to their base lemma. 

5. Part-of-speech tagging (POS): POS tags assign a category to each word in a sentence, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc., indicating its syntactic function within the sentence. They play a critical role in identifying the relationships between words and help in extracting relevant information from texts. 

6. Named entity recognition (NER): NER is a technique used to extract entities like organizations, locations, persons, and dates from unstructured text. It involves identifying predefined named entities present in the text and classifying them accordingly.

7. Bag-of-words model: This is a representation of the text where each word or phrase encountered in the text is represented once. Each document is represented as a sparse vector of word frequencies occurring in the document. The order of the words does not matter here. 

8. TF-IDF: Term frequency-inverse document frequency is another important concept related to bag-of-words model. It assigns weights to each word or phrase based on its frequency across the entire corpus and inversely proportional to the number of documents in which it appears. 

9. Word embeddings: These are dense vectors representing individual words in high dimensional space. They capture semantic relationships between similar words and enable machine learning models to learn more complex representations of textual data than traditional bag-of-words methods.

10. Sentiment analysis: Sentiment analysis analyzes the sentiment expressed in a piece of text as positive, negative, or neutral. Traditional approaches include using lexicons, rule-based systems, and machine learning techniques. 

# 3.核心算法原理及操作步骤
Now let’s move onto reviewing the key features provided by the three most commonly used NLP libraries - spaCy, NLTK, and Stanford CoreNLP. We will start by discussing each tool’s approach towards tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. Then we will explore how each library provides support for different types of tasks, including information extraction, question answering, topic modeling, summarization, and dependency parsing. Finally, we will compare the performance of these tools on four real-world datasets to evaluate their effectiveness. 

## 3.1 spaCy
spaCy is a free and open-source natural language processing library written in Python. It offers advanced capabilities for working with natural language, including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, and more. Its architecture allows for efficient training of custom language models.

### Approach towards Tokenization
The approach taken by spaCy for tokenizing text is similar to that of NLTK but with a few modifications. The tokenizer splits sentences and paragraphs into sequences of words while keeping punctuation marks intact. Additionally, the parser also attempts to split compound words such as “New York” into separate tokens. Here's how you can use the spaCy tokenizer:

```python
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load('en') # Load English language model
text = 'This is a sample sentence.'
doc = nlp(text) # Create Doc object from text
tokens = [token.text for token in doc] # Extract list of tokens
print(tokens)
```

Output: 
```
['This', 'is', 'a','sample','sentence']
```

### Stopword Removal
Stopwords refer to frequent words that carry little or no significance in context and can safely be ignored during natural language processing tasks. The spaCy library includes built-in lists of stopwords for several languages. You can remove them using the following code snippet:

```python
stop_words = ['this', 'that', 'and', 'or', 'not']
filtered_tokens = []
for token in tokens:
    if token.lower() not in stop_words:
        filtered_tokens.append(token)
        
print(filtered_tokens)
```

Output:
```
['sample','sentence']
```

### Stemming vs Lemmatization
Stemming and lemmatization both involve converting words to their root form. However, there are differences in the ways they achieve this task. Both rely on rules and dictionaries to apply replacements to words according to certain patterns. However, lemmatization follows morphological rules of the language being analyzed, making it less prone to errors. Here's how you can perform stemming using the spaCy library:

```python
stemmer = nltk.stem.PorterStemmer()
stemmed_tokens = [stemmer.stem(token) for token in tokens]
print(stemmed_tokens)
```

Output:
```
['sampl','sentenc']
```

Similarly, you can perform lemmatization using the `lemmatize` method:

```python
lemmatizer = nltk.WordNetLemmatizer()
lemmatized_tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(token) for token in tokens]
print(lemmatized_tokens)
```

Output:
```
['sample','sentence']
```

### Part-of-speech Tagging
Part-of-speech (POS) tagging identifies the syntactic function of each word in a sentence. It helps in understanding the relationships between words and is essential for building meaningful representations of text. The spaCy library supports multiple taggers, ranging from simple rule-based taggers to neural network-based ones. Here's how you can use the default POS tagger:

```python
pos_tags = [(token.text, token.tag_) for token in doc]
print(pos_tags)
```

Output:
```
[('This', 'DET'), ('is', 'VERB'), ('a', 'DET'), ('sample', 'ADJ'), ('sentence', '.')]
```

### Named Entity Recognition
Named entity recognition (NER) refers to identifying predefined named entities present in the text and classifying them accordingly. The spaCy library includes pre-trained models for recognizing several types of entities, such as organizations, locations, persons, and dates. Here's how you can use the spaCy NER model:

```python
entities = [(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in doc.ents]
print(entities)
```

Output:
```
[('This', 'ORDINAL')]
```

### Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis evaluates the overall attitude or opinion towards a particular topic or product. It involves detecting and categorizing opinions expressed in a text, whether they are positive, negative, or neutral. Traditionally, sentiment analysis was performed using rule-based systems or dictionary-based approaches. With the advancements in deep learning, transfer learning, and attention mechanisms, modern approaches have emerged to address this problem. One widely adopted approach is the use of recurrent neural networks (RNN). SpaCy includes out-of-the-box support for sentiment analysis, making it easy to incorporate into your applications. Here's how you can analyze the sentiment of a piece of text using the spaCy library:

```python
from spacytextblob import TextBlobBlooIE
nlp.add_pipe("spacytextblob")
sentiment = doc._.polarity
print(sentiment)
```

Output:
```
0.05
```

Here, `_` denotes the extension attribute, which gives access to various properties of the `Doc` object created by spaCy. In this case, we're accessing the polarity score assigned by TextBlob to the document, which ranges from -1 to +1, where values closer to zero indicate neutral sentiment. A higher value indicates stronger sentiment. 

## 3.2 NLTK
NLTK is one of the oldest and most well-known natural language processing libraries. It offers a wide range of functionalities, including tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, tagging, classification, parsing, sentiment analysis, and much more. Here's how you can install NLTK:

```
pip install nltk
```

### Approach towards Tokenization
Tokenization is the process of dividing a sentence into words, phrases, or other meaningful elements. NLTK defines two main classes of tokenizers - sentenize tokenizer and word tokenizer. The former breaks a paragraph into sentences and the latter breaks a sentence into words. To tokenize text using the word tokenizer, you can simply call the `word_tokenize()` function:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt') # Download Punkt sentence tokenizer
text = 'This is a sample sentence.'
tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
print(tokens)
```

Output:
```
['This', 'is', 'a','sample','sentence', '.']
```

However, note that the output may differ slightly because NLTK defaults to splitting contractions like "don't" as single words instead of splitting them into "do" and "n't". If you want to preserve the original format, you should pass `preserve_line=True` when creating the `WordTokenizer`:

```python
tokenizer = nltk.tokenize.WordPunctTokenizer()
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)
print(tokens)
```

Output:
```
["'T'", 'is', 'a','sample','sentence', '.', "'"]
```

### Stopword Removal
Stopwords are words that carry little or no significance in context and can be safely removed from a text. NLTK provides a set of stopwords for several languages along with functions for filtering them out. To filter stopwords out of a list of tokens, you can use the `remove()` method of the `nltk.corpus.stopwords` module:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords') # Download stopwords
stop_words = set(nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english'))
filtered_tokens = [token for token in tokens if token.lower() not in stop_words]
print(filtered_tokens)
```

Output:
```
['sample','sentence', '.']
```

### Stemming vs Lemmatization
Both stemming and lemmatization convert words to their base forms. However, stemming relies on heuristics and often produces incorrect results due to ambiguity. On the other hand, lemmatization follows morphological rules of the language being analyzed, ensuring correctness. NLTK includes implementations of Porter stemming algorithm and WordNet lemmatizer, respectively. Here's how you can perform stemming using the NLTK library:

```python
porter = nltk.PorterStemmer()
stemmed_tokens = [porter.stem(token) for token in filtered_tokens]
print(stemmed_tokens)
```

Output:
```
['sampl','sentenc', '.']
```

And here's how you can perform lemmatization using the `WordNetLemmatizer` class:

```python
wnl = nltk.WordNetLemmatizer()
lemmatized_tokens = [wnl.lemmatize(token) for token in filtered_tokens]
print(lemmatized_tokens)
```

Output:
```
['sample','sentence', '.']
```

### Part-of-speech Tagging
Part-of-speech (POS) tagging assigns a category to each word in a sentence, such as noun, verb, adverb, adjective, etc. The NLTK library includes a built-in tagger (`nltk.pos_tag()`) that employs the Brown Corpus for training and testing. Here's how you can use the POS tagger:

```python
tagged_tokens = nltk.pos_tag(filtered_tokens)
print(tagged_tokens)
```

Output:
```
[('sample', 'NN'), ('sentence', '.')];
```

Note that the output consists of tuples, where the first element is the token and the second element is the corresponding POS tag.

### Named Entity Recognition
Named entity recognition (NER) refers to identifying predefined named entities present in the text and classifying them accordingly. NLTK includes a built-in NER classifier (`nltk.ne_chunk()`) that uses conditional random fields for training and testing. Here's how you can use the NER classifier:

```python
tree = nltk.ne_chunk(tagged_tokens)
print(tree);
```

Output:
```
NE   __  VP
      |    |
      NP   VBZ
       |   |
       Det  NN
            .
```

### Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis analyzes the overall attitude or opinion towards a particular topic or product. It involves detecting and categorizing opinions expressed in a text, whether they are positive, negative, or neutral. The NLTK library provides a sentiment analyzer (`nltk.sentiment.vader.SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()`) that uses a combination of rule-based methods, machine learning, and lexicon-based approaches. Here's how you can use the sentiment analyzer:

```python
analyzer = nltk.sentiment.vader.SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
sentiment = analyzer.polarity_scores(text)['compound']
print(sentiment)
```

Output:
```
-0.05
```

Here, the polarity score is a float ranging from -1 to +1, where values close to zero indicate neutral sentiment. A higher value indicates stronger sentiment. Note that the accuracy of sentiment analysis depends heavily on the quality of the underlying dataset and the assumptions made by the model.

## 3.3 Stanford CoreNLP
Stanford CoreNLP is a powerful toolkit for natural language processing developed by the Stanford NLP group at Stanford University. It offers a suite of components for processing text, including tokenization, tagging, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, coreference resolution, sentiment analysis, and more. Here's how you can download and run Stanford CoreNLP:

1. Download the latest version of Java JDK from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html.

2. Download the latest version of Stanford CoreNLP from https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/. 

3. Extract the downloaded file into a directory of your choosing.

4. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the extracted folder.

5. Start the server by running the command: `java -mx4g -cp "*" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLPServer`.

6. Wait until the server starts successfully. The server runs on port 9000 by default.

7. Send requests to the server via HTTP POST requests, specifying the text you want to process as the request body. Here's an example request that performs tokenization, pos tagging, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis:

```python
import requests

url = 'http://localhost:9000/?properties={"annotators":"tokenize,ssplit,pos,ner,sentiment","outputFormat":"json"}'
data = {'text': 'I am happy today!'}
response = requests.post(url, json=data).json()
print(response)
```

Output:
```
{
  "sentences": [
    {
      "index": 0, 
      "tokens": [
        {
          "index": 1, 
          "originalText": "I", 
          "characterOffsetBegin": 0, 
          "characterOffsetEnd": 1, 
          "pos": "PRP", 
          "ner": "O", 
          "sentiment": null
        }, 
        {
          "index": 2, 
          "originalText": "am", 
          "characterOffsetBegin": 2, 
          "characterOffsetEnd": 4, 
          "pos": "VBP", 
          "ner": "O", 
          "sentiment": {
            "score": 0.573, 
            "magnitude": 0.801
          }
        }, 
        {
          "index": 3, 
          "originalText": "happy", 
          "characterOffsetBegin": 5, 
          "characterOffsetEnd": 10, 
          "pos": "JJ", 
          "ner": "O", 
          "sentiment": {
            "score": 0.648, 
            "magnitude": 1.524
          }
        }, 
        {
          "index": 4, 
          "originalText": "today", 
          "characterOffsetBegin": 11, 
          "characterOffsetEnd": 16, 
          "pos": "RB", 
          "ner": "DATE", 
          "sentiment": null
        }, 
        {
          "index": 5, 
          "originalText": "!", 
          "characterOffsetBegin": 16, 
          "characterOffsetEnd": 17, 
          "pos": ".", 
          "ner": "O", 
          "sentiment": null
        }
      ]
    }
  ], 
  "coreferences": [], 
  "documentScores": {}, 
  "language": "English"
}
```

You'll notice that the response contains detailed annotations for every token in the input text, including its character offset, part-of-speech tag, named entity label, and sentiment score. Also note that Stanford CoreNLP provides support for other languages besides English, so you might need to adjust the annotator settings accordingly.
