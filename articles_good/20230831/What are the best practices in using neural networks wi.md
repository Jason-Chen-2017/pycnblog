## 1.1 概述
在机器学习领域，最近几年随着数据科学家们越来越重视数据的采集、处理和分析，以及基于这些数据的模型训练和预测的需求，数据的不平衡(Imbalanced Data)问题已经成为一个热点话题。数据不平衡意味着某个类别的数据量比其他类别少很多，这会影响到模型的准确性和鲁棒性。由于不同类型的样本占据了数据集的比例较小，造成模型不能够很好地适应这些数据分布。因此，如何在数据不平衡的问题上取得更好的效果就显得尤为重要。

深度神经网络(Deep Neural Networks, DNNs)，特别是卷积神经网络(Convolutional Neural Networks, CNNs), 在处理图像、文本等多模态数据时表现出强大的能力。CNNs 的一个优点就是可以自动提取图像特征，而不需要人工设计特征提取的模型。这些特征经过分类器进行预测，实现了端到端的训练和预测过程。

然而，在实际应用中，由于数据集的不平衡性，模型在训练过程中容易陷入欠拟合或过拟合的状态，最终导致模型的准确率低下。为了解决这一问题，一些研究人员提出了不同的方法来处理数据不平衡的问题。如SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)方法，通过对少数类别的数据进行合成，来减少少数类别样本的数量，使其占据整个数据集的比例较高。

在本文中，我们将讨论以下三个问题:

1. 数据集的不平衡性有什么影响？
2. 如何处理数据集的不平衡性？
3. 有哪些最佳实践来处理数据集的不平衡性？
