写给开发者的软件架构实战：软件架构的演变历程
=========================================

作者：禅与计算机程序设计艺术

## 背景介绍

### 什么是软件架构？

软件架构(Software Architecture)是一个软件系统的高层次视图，它描述了系统中的组成部分、它们之间的关系以及它们的相互作用。软件架构是构建软件系统的蓝图，它定义了系统的基本结构、行为特征和原则。

### 为什么需要软件架构？

软件架构起着至关重要的作用，因为它可以帮助开发团队更好地理解软件系统的整体结构和设计原则，从而提高开发效率、降低维护成本、提高系统的可扩展性和可靠性。

### 软件架构的演变历程

软件架构的演变历程可以 tracing back to the early days of software development, when programmers wrote code without much consideration for structure or design. As software systems grew in size and complexity, the need for a more systematic approach to designing and building software became apparent. In this article, we will explore the evolution of software architecture over the past few decades, from monolithic architectures to microservices architectures.

## 核心概念与联系

### 单片（Monolithic）架构

单片架构是指将所有的业务逻辑和功能都集成到一个可执行文件中。该架构的优点是简单、易于开发和部署，但缺点是难以扩展和维护，因为任何一处修改都会影响整个系统。

### 分布式（Distributed）架构

分布式架构是指将一个大的系统分解成多个小的系统，每个系统运行在独立的进程中，通过网络通信来完成整个系统的工作。分布式架构的优点是可扩展性和可靠性强，但缺点是复杂性较高，需要考虑网络通信和故障恢复等问题。

### SOA（Service-Oriented Architecture）

SOA是一种分布式架构风格，它将系统分解成多个服务，每个服务 encapsulates a specific business capability or function. Services communicate with each other through standard protocols and interfaces, allowing for loose coupling and easy integration.

### Microservices Architecture

Microservices Architecture is an evolution of SOA that emphasizes even smaller, more fine-grained services. Each microservice is designed to perform a single, specific function, and communicates with other microservices through lightweight APIs. This architecture provides greater flexibility and scalability than traditional monolithic architectures, but can also introduce additional complexity and operational challenges.

### Service Registry and Discovery

Service Registry and Discovery is a key component of distributed and microservices architectures. It allows services to register themselves with a central registry, and enables other services to discover and communicate with them. Common service discovery patterns include client-side discovery (where clients are responsible for discovering and communicating with services) and server-side discovery (where a load balancer or proxy handles service discovery).

#### Client-Side Discovery

In client-side discovery, the client is responsible for discovering and communicating with the appropriate service instance. The client first queries the service registry to find available instances, then chooses one to communicate with based on load balancing or other criteria. Here's an example implementation using the Netflix OSS stack:
```java
// Create a RibbonLoadBalancerClient
RibbonLoadBalancerClient ribbonLoadBalancerClient = new RibbonLoadBalancerClient(new NamedContextFactory("my-service"), configuration);

// Look up available service instances
List<Server> servers = ribbonLoadBalancerClient.getReachableServersUnderLoadBalancer("my-service");

// Choose a server to communicate with
Server server = ribbonLoadBalancerClient.chooseServer("my-service", servers);

// Communicate with the chosen server
RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
ResponseEntity<String> response = restTemplate.getForEntity("http://" + server.getHostPort() + "/api/v1/my-endpoint", String.class);
```
#### Server-Side Discovery

In server-side discovery, a load balancer or proxy is responsible for discovering and communicating with service instances. Clients communicate with the load balancer or proxy, which then routes requests to the appropriate service instance. Here's an example implementation using Netflix OSS Eureka:
```vbnet
// Register the service instance with Eureka
EurekaClient eurekaClient = new EurekaClient(eurekaConfig);
EurekaInstance eurekaInstance = new EurekaInstance("my-service", "1.2.3.4", 8080);
eurekaClient.register(eurekaInstance);

// Configure the load balancer or proxy
RibbonLoadBalancerBuilder builder = new RibbonLoadBalancerBuilder();
builder.setLoadBalancer(new ZoneAwareLoadBalancer(new NamedContextFactory("my-service"), configuration));
builder.buildLoadBalancer();

// Communicate with the load balancer or proxy
RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
ResponseEntity<String> response = restTemplate.getForEntity("http://my-service/api/v1/my-endpoint", String.class);
```
### Circuit Breaker

Circuit Breaker is a pattern that helps prevent cascading failures in distributed systems. When a service is experiencing high error rates or latency, the circuit breaker trips and prevents further requests from being sent to that service until it recovers. Once the service has recovered, the circuit breaker resets and allows requests to be sent again.

Here's an example implementation using the Netflix OSS Hystrix library:
```java
// Define a command that wraps a remote call
HystrixCommand<String> command = new HystrixCommand<String>("my-command") {
  @Override
  protected String run() throws Exception {
   // Make a remote call
   ResponseEntity<String> response = restTemplate.getForEntity("http://my-service/api/v1/my-endpoint", String.class);
   return response.getBody();
  }
};

// Execute the command and handle any exceptions
try {
  String result = command.execute();
} catch (HystrixBadRequestException e) {
  // Handle bad request exceptions
} catch (HystrixRuntimeException e) {
  // Handle runtime exceptions
}
```
### Load Balancing

Load Balancing is a technique used to distribute traffic across multiple service instances in order to improve performance and availability. There are several load balancing algorithms, including round robin, random selection, least connections, and IP hash.

Here's an example implementation using the Apache HttpClient library:
```java
// Create a connection pool manager
PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager connectionManager = new PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager();

// Create a default I/O configuration
RequestConfig requestConfig = RequestConfig.custom()
   .setConnectTimeout(5000)
   .setSocketTimeout(3000)
   .build();

// Create an HTTP client
CloseableHttpClient httpClient = HttpClients.custom()
   .setConnectionManager(connectionManager)
   .setDefaultRequestConfig(requestConfig)
   .build();

// Create a list of service instances
List<URI> uris = Arrays.asList(
   URI.create("http://my-service-1:8080"),
   URI.create("http://my-service-2:8080"),
   URI.create("http://my-service-3:8080")
);

// Create a load balancer
RoundRobinLoadBalancer<URI> loadBalancer = new RoundRobinLoadBalancer<>(uris);

// Make a request to the load balancer
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  URI uri = loadBalancer.getResource();
  CloseableHttpResponse response = httpClient.execute(new HttpGet(uri));
  try {
   // Process the response
  } finally {
   response.close();
  }
}
```

### Implementing Service Registry and Discovery with Netflix OSS Eureka

In this section, we will demonstrate how to implement service registry and discovery using Netflix OSS Eureka. We will create a simple Java application that registers itself with Eureka and exposes a RESTful API. We will also create a second application that discovers the first application and communicates with it.

#### Application 1: Registering with Eureka

First, let's create a simple Java application that registers itself with Eureka. This application will expose a RESTful API that returns a greeting message. Here's the code:
```java
import com.netflix.appinfo.EurekaRegistry;
import com.netflix.discovery.DiscoveryManager;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@SpringBootApplication
public class Application1 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
   SpringApplication.run(Application1.class, args);
   EurekaRegistry registry = new EurekaRegistry();
   registry.register(new EurekaInstance("application1"));
   DiscoveryManager.getInstance().initComponent(registry);
  }

  @RestController
  public static class GreetingController {
   @GetMapping("/greeting")
   public String greeting() {
     return "Hello from Application 1!";
   }
  }
}
```
This application uses Spring Boot to simplify the development process. It registers itself with Eureka by creating an instance of `EurekaRegistry` and registering it with the `DiscoveryManager`. The `GreetingController` exposes a `greeting` endpoint that returns a greeting message.

#### Application 2: Discovering and Communicating with Application 1

Now, let's create a second application that discovers Application 1 and communicates with it. Here's the code:
```java
import org.springframework.cloud.client.ServiceInstance;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.DiscoveryClient;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.loadbalancer.LoadBalanced;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

import java.util.List;

@Configuration
public class Application2Configuration {
  @Bean
  @LoadBalanced
  public RestTemplate restTemplate() {
   return new RestTemplate();
  }

  @Bean
  public DiscoveryClient discoveryClient() {
   return new EurekaDiscoveryClient();
  }
}

@RestController
public class Application2Controller {
  private final RestTemplate restTemplate;
  private final DiscoveryClient discoveryClient;

  public Application2Controller(RestTemplate restTemplate, DiscoveryClient discoveryClient) {
   this.restTemplate = restTemplate;
   this.discoveryClient = discoveryClient;
  }

  @GetMapping("/greeting")
  public String greeting() {
   List<ServiceInstance> instances = discoveryClient.getInstances("application1");
   if (instances.isEmpty()) {
     throw new RuntimeException("Application 1 not found.");
   }
   String url = String.format("%s/greeting", instances.get(0).getUri());
   return restTemplate.getForObject(url, String.class);
  }
}
```
This application uses Spring Cloud to simplify the development process. It creates a `RestTemplate` bean that is load balanced, which allows it to communicate with remote services. It also creates a `DiscoveryClient` bean that can discover remote services registered with Eureka.

The `Application2Controller` controller uses the `RestTemplate` to communicate with Application 1. It first discovers the available instances of Application 1 using the `DiscoveryClient`, then constructs a URL for the `greeting` endpoint. Finally, it sends a GET request to the URL and returns the response.

### Implementing Circuit Breaker with Netflix OSS Hystrix

In this section, we will demonstrate how to implement circuit breaker using Netflix OSS Hystrix. We will create a simple Java application that wraps a remote call with a circuit breaker. If the remote call fails too many times or takes too long, the circuit breaker will trip and prevent further calls until it resets.

Here's the code:
```java
import com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixCommand;
import com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixCommandGroupKey;
import com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixThreadPoolKey;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;

@RestController
public class CircuitBreakerController {
  private final RestTemplate restTemplate;

  public CircuitBreakerController(RestTemplate restTemplate) {
   this.restTemplate = restTemplate;
  }

  @GetMapping("/circuit-breaker")
  public String circuitBreaker() throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
   CircuitBreakerCommand command = new CircuitBreakerCommand(restTemplate);
   String result = command.execute();
   return result;
  }

  private static class CircuitBreakerCommand extends HystrixCommand<String> {
   private final RestTemplate restTemplate;

   public CircuitBreakerCommand(RestTemplate restTemplate) {
     super(Setter.withGroupKey(HystrixCommandGroupKey.Factory.asKey("CircuitBreaker"))
         .andThreadPoolKey(HystrixThreadPoolKey.Factory.asKey("CircuitBreaker")));
     this.restTemplate = restTemplate;
   }

   @Override
   protected String run() throws Exception {
     // Make a remote call
     ResponseEntity<String> response = restTemplate.getForEntity("http://my-service/api/v1/my-endpoint", String.class);
     return response.getBody();
   }

   @Override
   protected String getFallback() {
     // Return a fallback message
     return "Circuit breaker opened.";
   }
  }
}
```
This application uses Spring Boot to simplify the development process. The `CircuitBreakerController` controller wraps a remote call with a circuit breaker using the `CircuitBreakerCommand`. The `CircuitBreakerCommand` extends the `HystrixCommand` class and overrides the `run` method to make a remote call. If the remote call fails too many times or takes too long, the circuit breaker will trip and the fallback method will be invoked.

## 附录：常见问题与解答

Q: What is the difference between monolithic architecture and microservices architecture?
A: Monolithic architecture is a traditional approach where all components of an application are tightly integrated and deployed together as a single unit. In contrast, microservices architecture is a modern approach where an application is broken down into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs.

Q: How does service discovery work in a distributed system?
A: Service discovery is a technique used in distributed systems to locate and communicate with other services. It involves registering services with a central registry, which other services can then query to find available instances.

Q: What is circuit breaker and how does it work?
A: Circuit breaker is a pattern used in distributed systems to prevent cascading failures. It works by monitoring the health of a service and tripping the circuit when errors occur too frequently or take too long. This prevents further requests from being sent to the failing service until it recovers.

Q: What is load balancing and how does it work?
A: Load balancing is a technique used in distributed systems to distribute traffic across multiple service instances. It involves selecting a service instance to handle a request based on predefined criteria such as round robin, least connections, or IP hash.

Q: How do I choose the right architecture for my application?
A: Choosing the right architecture for your application depends on several factors, including the size and complexity of the application, the expected traffic volume, and the desired level of scalability and reliability. You should also consider the tradeoffs between different architectures, such as ease of development versus operational complexity.
