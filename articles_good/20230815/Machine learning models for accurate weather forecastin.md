# 1.简介
  
 
Smart Greenhouse is a new type of greenhouse concept that uses advanced technology to monitor and regulate the temperature inside a greenhouse or greenhouse-like structure. The major idea behind this concept is to use sensors on the outside of the greenhouse to measure air humidity and moisture levels, as well as other environmental parameters such as light intensity and wind speed. This information can be used by an AI algorithm to predict the temperature within the greenhouse at any given time based on historical weather patterns. In this article we will discuss several machine learning algorithms that can be applied to predict the temperature within a Smart Greenhouse.

# 2.相关工作 Background
Previous research has shown that integrating IoT devices with machine learning algorithms can improve accuracy and reduce operational costs in monitoring and controlling various aspects of natural environments. For example, there have been several works focused on developing efficient algorithms for anomaly detection in sensor data streams [1], building recommendation systems using mobile device sensors [2] and detecting contextual factors influencing human behavior through social media [3]. Similarly, the potential of applying machine learning techniques to accurately predict the temperature within a greenhouse depends largely on its ability to analyze multidimensional environmental data from sensing technologies like remote sensors, soil moisture levels, and ambient conditions, as well as historical weather data.

One common challenge faced by greenhouse owners and managers is managing the complexity and scale of their greenhouses over time while ensuring optimal energy efficiency. To address these challenges, recent years have seen a shift away from manual greenhouse control towards intelligent automated control schemes that utilize sophisticated machine learning algorithms. These technologies enable greenhouse owners and managers to more easily optimize operations by automatically adjusting thermostat settings, ventilation systems, and irrigation schedule according to current conditions and preferences [4]. However, forecasting the climate condition within a greenhouse remains a challenging task due to the interconnected nature of all relevant environmental factors.

3. Splitting the data into train and test sets
4. Building the model - defining the hyperparameters and initializing the estimator object
5. Training the model on the train set
6. Evaluating the model's performance on the test set
7. Tuning the hyperparameters if needed
8. Using the trained model to make predictions on new data

Code snippet showing how to implement Light GBM algorithm for temperature forecasting in a Smart Greenhouse:

```python

from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from datetime import timedelta
import lightgbm as lgb

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('smartgreenhouse_temperature.csv')

# Convert timestamp column to datetime format
df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'])

# Set the index to timestamp column
df = df.set_index('timestamp')

# Define the target feature 'temperature' and remove it from the dataframe
target = df[['temperature']]
features = df.drop(['temperature'], axis=1)

# Scale the features using min max scaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaled_features = scaler.fit_transform(features)

# Create lagged features for time series forecasting
shifted_features = []
for i in range(1, 8):
    shifted_feature = scaled_features.copy().reshape(-1)
    shifted_feature[i:] = shifted_feature[:-i]
    shifted_features.append(pd.DataFrame({'lag{}'.format(i+1): shifted_feature}))
    
# Concatenate the original features and the lagged features
new_features = pd.concat([features, *shifted_features], axis=1).dropna()

# Split the data into train and test sets
train_size = int(len(new_features)*0.8)
train_data = new_features[:train_size]
