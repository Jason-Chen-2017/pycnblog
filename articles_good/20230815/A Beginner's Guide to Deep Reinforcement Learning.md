# 1.简介
  

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a new branch of artificial intelligence that combines deep neural networks with reinforcement learning techniques to solve complex tasks by optimizing the agent's actions in real-time. DRL has emerged as an exciting field in recent years due to its significant potential for advancing research and industry development. In this article, we will cover the basic concepts and algorithms behind DRL, including Q-learning, actor-critic methods, policy gradient methods, model-based RL, and more advanced topics such as exploration vs exploitation, transfer learning, curiosity driven learning, and imitation learning. We'll also demonstrate how these algorithms can be applied using popular open source libraries like OpenAI Gym, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. By following along with our explanations, you should have a good understanding of DRL and be able to apply it effectively on your own projects. 

# 2.背景介绍
DRL stands for "deep reinforcement learning," which refers to the combination of deep neural networks and reinforcement learning techniques used together to learn complex tasks in real-time. As mentioned earlier, DRL was initially introduced in 2013 by Google DeepMind. Since then, there have been many advancements in the field, ranging from AlphaGo to Robotic Manipulation, where DRL algorithms are successfully applied in diverse fields such as gaming, robotics, and medicine. 

In simple terms, DRL involves training agents to act in environments through trial and error. The goal of the agent is to maximize its rewards over time while interacting with its environment. Unlike supervised or unsupervised machine learning algorithms, DRL requires a systematic approach in order to obtain sophisticated policies that can adapt to different situations. This makes it challenging because it relies heavily on feedback, making it difficult to optimize directly without being trapped in local minima. Nonetheless, there are several strategies proposed to address these challenges. These include:

1. **Exploration**: Agents must explore the environment to find optimal solutions, but they need to do so carefully not to get stuck in local minima. One way to achieve this is to use exploration strategy such as random sampling or adding noise to the action space. 

2. **Exploitation**: Once an optimal solution is found, agents need to exploit it efficiently by avoiding suboptimal behaviors. One way to accomplish this is to take into account prior knowledge about the problem domain, such as preferences learned from human behavior or animal experiments. 

3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Agents learn how to make decisions based on their observations and interactions with the environment. They learn from reward signals obtained during each step of the episode. However, reward signals alone cannot capture all aspects of the task. To improve performance, other types of signal may be necessary, such as penalties for violating constraints or punishments for deviating from best practices. 

4. **Transfer Learning**: When multiple similar problems arise within the same domain, transfer learning allows the agent to leverage knowledge acquired previously for better performance. This includes sharing experiences across tasks, reusing models trained on related datasets, and fine-tuning pre-trained models to specific tasks. 

5. **Model-Based Reinforcement Learning**: While value functions provide insights into how well an agent is doing, they do not explain why it is making certain decisions. Model-based reinforcement learning focuses on building causal models that represent the underlying decision process. It uses dynamic programming techniques to estimate the expected return of state transitions and takes into account uncertainty associated with transition probabilities.

## 3.1 Q-Learning 
Q-learning is one of the most fundamental and simplest reinforcement learning algorithms. It belongs to the family of model-free control algorithms, meaning it does not require a complete model of the environment beforehand. Rather, it learns by updating estimates of the Q function at each iteration based on the observed outcomes of previous actions. Here's how it works: 

1. Initialize the Q function $Q(s,a)$ for all possible states and actions. 
2. Choose an initial state $s$ randomly. 
3. Repeat until convergence:
   - Take action $a_t$ from state $s_t$ according to the current policy $\pi$. 
   - Observe reward $r_{t+1}$ and next state $s_{t+1}$. 
   - Update the Q function $Q(s_t,a_t)$ by adding the discounted future reward to the current estimated value: 
   
       $$Q(s_t,a_t)\leftarrow \left(1-\alpha\right)Q(s_t,a_t)+\alpha\left(r_{t+1}+\gamma \max _{a} Q\left(s_{t+1}, a\right)\right).$$

       Here, $\alpha$ is the learning rate, $\gamma$ is the discount factor, and $\max _{a} Q\left(s_{t+1}, a\right)$ represents the maximum Q value for any action in the next state $s_{t+1}$.

   - After a fixed number of iterations, choose a new set of parameters for the policy to update accordingly. 

The main advantage of Q-learning compared to other model-free control methods is its simplicity and efficiency. Its main disadvantage is that it only considers immediate reward effects, neglecting delayed consequences and long-term dependencies. Despite these shortcomings, Q-learning has been shown to perform well in many practical domains. For example, it has been successfully applied to games such as Atari Breakout and Go, and can be extended to handle continuous spaces as well. Some variants of Q-learning exist, such as Double Q-learning and Dueling Networks, which try to address some of its drawbacks. 

Here's an implementation of Q-learning using OpenAI gym: 

```python
import numpy as np
import gym
from collections import defaultdict

class Agent:
    def __init__(self, env):
        self.env = env
        self.q_table = defaultdict(lambda: [0]*env.action_space.n)
        
    def epsilon_greedy_policy(self, state, epsilon=0.1):
        if np.random.uniform() < epsilon:
            return self.env.action_space.sample() # explore
        else:
            q_values = self.q_table[state]
            max_value = max(q_values)
            return np.random.choice([i for i, v in enumerate(q_values) if v == max_value])
    
    def train(self, num_episodes):
        for i in range(num_episodes):
            done = False
            total_reward = 0
            observation = self.env.reset()
            
            while not done:
                action = self.epsilon_greedy_policy(observation)
                prev_observation = observation
                
                observation, reward, done, info = self.env.step(action)
                total_reward += reward
                
                max_next_q = max(self.q_table[observation])
                td_target = reward + self.discount_factor*max_next_q
                
                self.update_q_function(prev_observation, action, td_target)
                
            print("Episode {} finished with score {}".format(i+1, total_reward))
                
    def update_q_function(self, state, action, td_target):
        alpha = 0.1
        gamma = 0.9
        
        current_q = self.q_table[state][action]
        self.q_table[state][action] = current_q + alpha*(td_target - current_q)
        
if __name__=="__main__":
    env = gym.make('CartPole-v0')
    agent = Agent(env)
    agent.train(1000)
```

Note that this code snippet assumes a discrete action space and implements an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. There are other variations of Q-learning such as Boltzmann Q-learning, which modify the selection rule to give higher probability to high-performing actions and lower probability to low-performing actions, and Advantage Actor Critic (A2C), which further generalizes Q-learning to continuous action spaces. Moreover, a variety of off-the-shelf implementations of Q-learning exist in various packages, including Keras, Tensorflow, and Pytorch. 

## 3.2 Actor-Critic Methods 
Actor-critic methods combine two components: an actor network that determines the agent's action given its observation, and a critic network that evaluates the agent's performance. Each component interacts with the environment in turn, receiving information both from the environment itself and from the actors' choices. Here's how it works: 

1. Initialize the actor and critic networks with random weights.
2. Start a loop for a fixed number of episodes or until convergence:
   - Generate an episode trajectory by running the policy π in the environment starting from a given initial state. 
   - Compute the returns for each timestep by summing up all future rewards multiplied by a discount factor $\gamma$: 
   
      $$\begin{aligned}G_t&=\sum^{T}_{k=t+1}\gamma^{k-t-1}R_{k}\\\end{aligned}$$
      
      where $T$ is the last timestep of the episode. 
      
   - Use the entire episode trajectory to update the actor and critic networks simultaneously:
      - Run the policy π in the environment again, keeping track of the logarithmic probabilities of taking each action and the corresponding values received by the critic for those states. 
      - Calculate the advantages for each timestep using the difference between the values received by the critic and the baseline prediction made by the actor: 
       
          $$\begin{aligned}A_t^{(i)}&\leftarrow Q_{\theta^{\prime}}(S_t,\mu_\phi(S_t))+b(S_t)\\\end{aligned}$$
          
          Here, $\theta^\prime$ denotes the updated critic network parameters after applying gradients to minimize MSE loss, $\mu_\phi$ is the updated actor network parameterization, and $b$ is a baseline prediction made by the actor network (e.g., the mean of the values received by the critic). 
          
      - Using the advantages calculated above, update the critic network parameters using a gradient descent method such as Adam, minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted values and the actual returns using the TD formula: 
        
          $$\begin{aligned}\theta_i^\prime&\leftarrow\theta_i^-+\alpha\nabla L(\theta_i^-)\\\end{aligned}$$
          
      - Backpropagate the changes made to the actor network parameters $\theta_\phi$ using a gradient descent method such as Adam, minimizing the negative likelihood of selecting the right actions according to the updated critic predictions and the entropy of the policy distribution produced by the actor network: 
        
          $$\begin{aligned}\phi_j^\prime&\leftarrow\phi_j^-\leftarrow+\beta\nabla_{\phi_j}\left[\log\pi(a|s;\phi_j)-Q_{\theta}(\phi_j(s),a)\right]-\alpha H[\pi(\cdot|s;\phi_j)]\\\end{aligned}$$
  
  Note that this algorithm relies on bootstrapping, which means that it updates the target critic and actor networks periodically rather than every single iteration. This improves stability and prevents the critic from overestimating the true value function. Other variants of actor-critic methods include A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic), PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), and DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients). 

An implementation of A2C using Pytorch is below: 

```python
import torch

class Actor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super().__init__()

This code snippet demonstrates how to implement an actor-critic agent using Pytorch. The `Agent` class contains three neural networks: `Actor`, `Critic`, and `Memory`. The `Memory` object is simply a buffer to store experienced tuples of `(state, action, reward, done)`. During training, each tuple is sampled uniformly at random from this buffer and fed to the `update()` method. The `update()` method calculates the advantages for each timestep using the difference between the values received by the critic and the baseline prediction made by the actor, updates the critic network using the resulting loss function, and backpropagates the changes made to the actor network parameters. Finally, the average score per episode over the latest 10 episodes is printed to the console.
