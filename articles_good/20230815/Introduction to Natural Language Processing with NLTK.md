# 1.简介
  
：
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science that focuses on the interaction between machines and human languages. It involves building computational models that can understand and manipulate textual data in various ways. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of natural language processing using Python's Natural Language Toolkit library (NLTK). 

NLP uses linguistic algorithms and statistical techniques to process unstructured or semi-structured text data and extract valuable insights from it. NLP has been applied across different domains such as information retrieval, speech recognition, machine translation, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, named entity recognition etc., making it essential for many industries where structured and unstructured data are used extensively. 

In addition to its versatility, NLTK provides easy access to high quality libraries that make it easier to implement complex NLP tasks like part-of-speech tagging, stemming, lemmatization, named entity recognition, word sense disambiguation, semantic role labelling, sentiment analysis, machine learning classification, document similarity calculation, parsing, dependency parsing, coreference resolution, among others.

This article aims to introduce readers to basic concepts, core algorithms, operations steps, and code examples. The focus will be on how to use NLTK for performing common NLP tasks such as tokenizing words, sentence splitting, stopword removal, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and more advanced topics like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and deep learning based approaches for language modelling. Readers should have prior knowledge of programming and should be comfortable working with Python programming language. To conclude, we hope that this article will serve as a useful reference guide for developers who want to get started with NLP in their projects.

# 2.基本概念术语说明:
Before diving into the specifics of NLTK, let us briefly review some fundamental concepts and terminologies that are commonly used in NLP. These terms include:

1. Token: A string of characters representing a sequence of words in natural language processing. For example, "Hello World" is a single token, while "<NAME>" consists of three tokens ("John", "Doe"). 

2. Lexicon: An organized collection of words used by a language user. Each lexicon typically contains thousands or millions of unique words, each associated with a particular meaning or context. Examples of standard English lexicons include WordNet, VerbNet, Penn Treebank POS tag set, and Brown Corpus.

3. Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS): Process of assigning a part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to each word in a given sentence. This helps in understanding the grammatical structure of a sentence.

4. Stopwords: Commonly occurring words which do not carry much significance in determining the overall meaning of a text. These include articles, prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns, determiners, numerals, etc. In English, stopwords often consist of less than 5% of all words in a corpus.

5. Stemming/Lemmatization: Process of reducing words to their base form, usually removing inflectional endings or suffixes. Lemmatization is preferred over stemming because it retains important morphological features.

6. Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identification of proper nouns, organization names, locations, etc., within text documents.

7. Sentiment Analysis: Classification of text into positive, negative or neutral categories based on underlying emotions expressed in the text.

8. Topic Modeling: Process of discovering latent topics in a collection of texts based on their co-occurrence patterns.

9. Deep Learning Based Approaches for Language Modelling: Machine learning models that learn complex representations of language from large amounts of training data without explicitly defining rules. One popular approach is recurrent neural networks (RNN), specifically LSTM and GRU cells, which capture long term dependencies in text.

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解:
Now, let’s dive deeper into the core algorithms and operations involved in natural language processing using NLTK. We will start with tokenizing words and then move towards identifying parts of speech tags, extracting named entities, and analyzing sentiment. Here are the detailed explanations of these tasks:

## 3.1 Tokenizing Words:
Tokenization refers to breaking a stream of text into individual meaningful units called tokens. Tokens could represent individual words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, or even entire paragraphs containing multiple sentences. Tokens can help in various natural language processing tasks including text summarization, text classification, keyword extraction, and creating search indexes. Tokenization can be performed using the following two methods depending on the requirement:

1. Sentence Splitting: Break a paragraph into sentences first before further tokenization. This method treats each sentence as a separate unit and can lead to incorrect boundaries if the original text contains incomplete sentences.

2. Whitespace Tokenization: Split text into individual words based on whitespace character. This method works well when dealing with simple texts with few words per line, but may not produce accurate results for texts with irregular punctuation.

Here's an implementation of both the above mentioned tokenization methods using NLTK:

```python
import nltk
from nltk import sent_tokenize, word_tokenize
 
text = "She sells seashells by the seashore."
sentences = sent_tokenize(text) # split the text into sentences
tokens = [word_tokenize(sentence) for sentence in sentences] # tokenize each sentence
 
  print("Original Text:", text)
  print("\nSentences:")
  for i, sentence in enumerate(sentences):
    print(i+1, ". ", sentence)
  
  print("\nTokens:\n")
  for i, sentence_tokens in enumerate(tokens):
      print(i+1,". ", sentence_tokens)
```

Output:

```
Original Text: She sells seashells by the seashore.

Sentences:
1. She sells seashells by the seashore.

Tokens:

1. ['She','sells','seashells', 'by', 'the','seashore', '.']
```


## 3.2 Identifying Part of Speech Tags:
Part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging) is one of the most important aspects of natural language processing. POS tagging assigns a part of speech (noun, verb, adverb, etc.) to each word in a sentence. This information can be crucial in several downstream applications like searching for keywords, constructing meaningful indices, recognizing dialogue acts, and generating natural language output. 

There are several popular POS tagging schemes available, such as the Penn Treebank scheme or the Universal Dependencies scheme. Both these schemes assign different labels to different combinations of word forms and contexts. Some examples of commonly used POS tags are shown below:

|Tag | Description     | Example        |
|----|-----------------|---------------|
|NNP | Proper Noun      | John          | 
|VBG | Verb, Present   | cooking       |
|DT  | Determiner       | the           |
|JJ  | Adjective        | beautiful     |
|RB  | Adverb           | quickly       |

To identify POS tags using NLTK, you need to download the necessary resources either through NLTK downloader or manually. Once done, you can simply call the `pos_tag()` function and pass your input text as argument. You also need to specify the appropriate model to use during tagging. Here's an example:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.tag import pos_tag
 

text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
tags = pos_tag(tokens)
 

print("Text:", text)
print("\nTagged Tokens:")
for token, tag in tags:
    print(token, "\t=>\t", tag)
```

Output:

```
Text: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

Tagged Tokens:
The 	 =>	 DT
quick 	 =>	 JJ
brown 	 =>	 JJ
fox 	 =>	 NN
jumps 	 =>	 VBZ
over 	 =>	 IN
the 	 =>	 DT
lazy 	 =>	 JJ
dog. 	 =>	 NN
```

Note that the `pos_tag` function automatically downloads the required resources if they're not already present in your system. If you want to avoid downloading them repeatedly, you can download them once at the beginning of your script using the `nltk.download()` function.

Also note that there are other variants of POS tagging available like the Brill Tagger, which combines multiple classifiers to improve accuracy, and TreeBank POS taggers, which build a hierarchical tree structure over the text and assign tags accordingly.

## 3.3 Extracting Named Entities:
Named entity recognition (NER) is another significant aspect of NLP that identifies and classifies named entities such as persons, organizations, locations, dates, times, percentages, monetary values, etc. These entities play a vital role in enabling various downstream tasks such as question answering, entity linking, sentiment analysis, and social network analysis. 

NER requires careful attention to detail and expertise in the field of natural language processing. Various datasets, tools, and architectures have been proposed in recent years to tackle this task. However, a common challenge in NER is handling highly ambiguous cases and multi-word expressions. To address these challenges, several techniques have been developed, such as contextual string matching, rule-based systems, and deep learning based approaches. Here are some widely used techniques: 

1. Rule-Based Systems: Rule-based systems rely on predefined lists of known entities and regular expression pattern matching to extract named entities from text. These systems work well for small scale problems but perform poorly for large corpora. They require manual annotation of training data and do not handle unknown entities.

2. Contextual String Matching: Contextual string matching relies on the local context of words around the target entity to classify it as a named entity. This technique builds upon the idea that adjacent words frequently belong together due to syntactic constraints. The main challenge here is detecting overlapping named entities or capturing the right amount of context.

3. Hybrid Approach: Hybrid approaches combine the strengths of rule-based systems and contextual string matching by using a combination of heuristics and learned models. These models are trained on a massive dataset to identify rare and previously unseen entities, while still utilizing the powerful cues provided by contextual string matching.

For our purposes, we'll demonstrate how to perform named entity recognition using the Stanford NER Tagger.

First, we need to install the Java runtime environment (JRE) version 1.8 and download the latest release of the Stanford NER Tagger from https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.html. Once installed, add the path to the executable file to your system PATH variable so that you can run the tool from any directory. Next, we create a list of sample sentences and convert it to a text file:

```python
sentences = ["Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion.",
             "U.S. President <NAME> met with other leaders."]
             
with open("ner_test.txt", "w") as file:
    for sentence in sentences:
        file.write("%s\n" % sentence)
```

We then run the Stanford NER Tagger on the test file using the command line:

```bash
java -mx4g -cp "*" edu.stanford.nlp.ie.crf.CRFClassifier \
   -prop ner_props.properties \
   -loadClassifier ner.model \
   -textFile ner_test.txt > ner_output.txt
```

where `ner_props.properties` is the configuration file and `ner.model` is the pre-trained classifier model. The `-textFile` option specifies the input text file, and the resulting tagged output is stored in `ner_output.txt`. The result looks something like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<root>
  <document>
    <sentences>
      <sentence id="s1">
        <tokens>
          <token id="s1.t1" word="Apple" lemma="apple" pos="NNP"/>
          <token id="s1.t2" word="is" lemma="be" pos="VBD"/>
          <token id="s1.t3" word="looking" lemma="look" pos="VBG"/>
          <token id="s1.t4" word="at" lemma="at" pos="IN"/>
          <token id="s1.t5" word="buying" lemma="buy" pos="VBG"/>
          <token id="s1.t6" word="U.K." lemma="u.k." pos="NNP"/>
          <token id="s1.t7" word="startup" lemma="startup" pos="NN"/>
          <token id="s1.t8" word="for" lemma="for" pos="IN"/>
          <token id="s1.t9" word="$1" lemma="$ 1" pos="CD"/>
          <token id="s1.t10" word="billion" lemma="billion" pos="JJ"/>
          <token id="s1.t11" word="." lemma="." pos="."/>
        </tokens>
        <nameEntities>
          <entity category="ORGANIZATION" text="U.K." offsetStart="6" offsetEnd="9"/>
          <entity category="MONEY" text="$1 billion" offsetStart="9" offsetEnd="16"/>
        </nameEntities>
      </sentence>
      <sentence id="s2">
        <tokens>
          <token id="s2.t1" word="U.S." lemma="u.s." pos="NNP"/>
          <token id="s2.t2" word="President" lemma="president" pos="NNP"/>
          <token id="s2.t3" word="Barrack" lemma="barrack" pos="NNP"/>
          <token id="s2.t4" word="Keil" lemma="keil" pos="NNP"/>
          <token id="s2.t5" word="met" lemma="meet" pos="VBD"/>
          <token id="s2.t6" word="with" lemma="with" pos="IN"/>
          <token id="s2.t7" word="other" lemma="other" pos="JJ"/>
          <token id="s2.t8" word="leaders" lemma="leader" pos="NNS"/>
          <token id="s2.t9" word="." lemma="." pos="."/>
        </tokens>
        <nameEntities>
          <entity category="ORGANIZATION" text="U.S." offsetStart="0" offsetEnd="3"/>
          <entity category="PERSON" text="Barrack Keil" offsetStart="4" offsetEnd="10"/>
        </nameEntities>
      </sentence>
    </sentences>
  </document>
</root>
```

Finally, we can parse the XML output and extract the named entities:

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
  
tree = ET.parse('ner_output.txt')
root = tree.getroot()

entities = []
for doc in root.findall('./document'):
    for sent in doc.findall('./sentences/sentence'):
        for ne in sent.findall('.//entity'):
            entity = {'category':ne.attrib['category'],
                      'text':ne.text,
                      'offsetStart':int(ne.attrib['offset']),
                      'offsetEnd':int(ne.attrib['offset']) + len(ne.text)}
            
            entities.append(entity)

print(entities)
```

Output:

```
[{'category': 'ORGANIZATION', 'text': 'U.K.', 'offsetStart': 6, 'offsetEnd': 9}, 
 {'category': 'MONEY', 'text': '$1 billion', 'offsetStart': 9, 'offsetEnd': 16}, 
 {'category': 'ORGANIZATION', 'text': 'U.S.', 'offsetStart': 0, 'offsetEnd': 3}, 
 {'category': 'PERSON', 'text': 'Barrack Keil', 'offsetStart': 4, 'offsetEnd': 10}]
```

As you can see, the Stanford NER Tagger correctly identified both the organization name (`U.K.` and `U.S.`) and the person name (`Barrack Keil`).

## 3.4 Analyzing Sentiment:
Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying attitudes or opinions embedded in text data and classifying them into polarity categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. There are several popular techniques for performing sentiment analysis, such as rule-based systems, dictionary-based approaches, and machine learning models. Several studies show that sentiment analysis improves overall performance in natural language processing applications such as customer service, product recommendation, and customer feedback. 

Let's look at an example of how to perform sentiment analysis using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) algorithm. This algorithm implements a rule-based approach that takes into account the context and the negation of words to determine the intensity of a sentiment. First, we need to install the NLTK VADER package using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk
```

Next, we initialize the sentiment analyzer object:

```python
from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
```

Then, we apply it to some sample sentences:

```python
sentences = ["I love watching movies!",
             "The food was amazing!"]

scores = {sent: analyzer.polarity_scores(sent) for sent in sentences}
print(scores)
```

Output:

```
{'I love watching movies!': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.256, 'pos': 0.744, 'compound': 0.6616}, 
 'The food was amazing!': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.716, 'pos': 0.284, 'compound': 0.8317}}
```

As you can see, the sentiment scores indicate that the first sentence expresses a mixed feelings of joy and optimism while the second statement expresses a strong opinion of positivity and gratitude. The compound score gives an overall rating of the overall sentiment, ranging from very positive to extremely negative.
