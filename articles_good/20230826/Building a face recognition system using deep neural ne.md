# 1.简介
  

Computer Vision (CV) is an increasingly important field in the modern age, and it has become one of the most popular areas for businesses to pursue new ideas such as self-driving cars or social media monitoring. One interesting application of CV is facial recognition, where software can recognize who a person is based on their unique features like their eyes, nose and mouth shape. In this blog post, we will discuss how to build a simple yet accurate facial recognition system that can identify multiple people from different angles, even when they have minor variations in appearance due to age, gender, etc. 

In this tutorial, we will be building a face recognition system using convolutional neural networks (CNN). CNN is a type of artificial neural network that are particularly well suited for computer vision tasks because of their ability to learn spatial relationships between pixels in images. The model we use here is known as Convolutional Neural Network + SVM (Convolutional Neural Network with Support Vector Machine), which combines traditional feature extraction techniques with machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy.

The general process of building a face recognition system includes the following steps:

1. Collect and preprocess data: We collect a dataset of faces of various persons under different lighting conditions, backgrounds, expressions, poses, orientations, etc., and preprocess them to extract only the necessary information, such as the face area, position, orientation, and landmarks, needed for training our algorithm.

2. Train the model: Once we have preprocessed our data, we train our CNN+SVM model. This involves feeding our processed data into our CNN architecture, which learns spatial relationships between pixels in images. Next, we apply trained weights to the output layer of the CNN, and pass it through a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, which separates the faces belonging to two different classes based on their attributes. By adjusting hyperparameters such as regularization term, kernel function, gamma value, etc., we can fine-tune our model to achieve better results.

3. Test the model: Finally, we test our trained model on unseen data to evaluate its performance. To measure the performance of our model, we typically compare the predicted labels against the true labels obtained during preprocessing stage. However, since there can be variations in the appearances of faces caused by age, gender, etc., we also include metrics such as EER and FRR, which evaluate the tradeoff between false acceptance rate (FAR) and false rejection rate (FRR) across all possible thresholds. 

Let's dive deeper into each of the above steps and explore more details regarding each component of the final face recognition system.



# 3. 数据准备与预处理
We start by collecting a dataset of faces. For simplicity purposes, let us assume we just have three images of three different people: John Doe, Jane Smith and Bob Johnson. These images should ideally come from different viewpoints and environmental conditions to ensure high variance in appearance. Each image should have the corresponding label indicating which person appears in the picture. Below is the sample layout of our dataset:

```bash
data
    ├── johndoe
    │    └──... 
    ├── janesmith
    │    └──...    
    └── bobjohnson
        └──...    
``` 

Next, we perform some basic preprocessing steps on the collected images, including cropping the faces, resizing the images to uniform dimensions, and applying normalization and standardization operations. Normalization ensures that pixel values fall within a certain range, while standardization subtracts the mean and divides by the standard deviation, resulting in zero-mean unit-variance distributions. Here is the Python code for performing these preprocessing steps:

```python
import cv2
from os import listdir
from os.path import join
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from keras.utils import to_categorical

def load_dataset(train_dir):
    """Loads the dataset of faces."""

    # List the directories containing images of individuals
    class_names = sorted([cls for cls in listdir(train_dir)])
    
    # Create empty lists to store image paths and labels
    img_paths = []
    labels = []

    # Iterate over individual folders and add image paths and labels
    for i, cls in enumerate(class_names):
        img_files = [join(train_dir, cls, file) for file in listdir(join(train_dir, cls))]
        img_paths += img_files
        labels += [i] * len(img_files)
        
    # Encode the integer labels into binary vectors
    encoder = LabelEncoder()
    encoded_labels = to_categorical(encoder.fit_transform(labels))
    
    return img_paths, encoded_labels

def preprocess_image(img_file):
    """Preprocesses an image by cropping, resizing, normalizing and standardizing."""

    # Load the image and crop the face region
    img = cv2.imread(img_file)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    rect = cv2.CascadeClassifier('haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml').detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=4)
    x, y, w, h = rect[0]
    cropped_img = img[y:y+h, x:x+w]

    # Resize the image to a fixed size
    resized_img = cv2.resize(cropped_img, (224, 224)) / 255.
    
    return resized_img
    
def load_preprocessed_dataset(train_dir):
    """Loads the preprocessed dataset of faces."""
    
    # Load the raw dataset
    img_paths, labels = load_dataset(train_dir)
    
    # Preprocess the images
    preprocessed_images = np.array([preprocess_image(img_file) for img_file in img_paths])
    
    return preprocessed_images, labels
```

The `load_dataset` function takes the path to the directory containing the individual subfolders with images, reads the names of those subfolders, and creates a list of paths to each image and the corresponding integer label indicating the identity of the subject in the image. It then encodes the integer labels into binary vectors using scikit-learn's `LabelEncoder` and returns both the image paths and the encoded labels. 

The `preprocess_image` function loads an image, converts it to grayscale, applies OpenCV's cascade classifier to detect the face region, crops the detected face region, resizes the cropped image to a fixed size (224 x 224 pixels), and normalizes and standardizes the resized image by dividing each pixel value by 255. Finally, it returns the preprocessed image.

The `load_preprocessed_dataset` function simply calls `load_dataset` to obtain the original image paths and labels, and then passes each image file path to `preprocess_image`. The resulting arrays of preprocessed images and labels are returned. 



# 4. 模型训练
Now that we have prepared our dataset, we can begin training our face recognition system. Our first task is to define our CNN architecture. Specifically, we implement a custom architecture called ResNet-34, which consists of several layers of residual blocks, followed by global average pooling, and a fully connected layer for classification. Here is the Python code for defining our CNN architecture using Keras:

```python
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, GlobalAveragePooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Input
from keras.models import Model
from keras.applications.resnet import ResNet34

def create_model():
    """Creates the ResNet-34 model for face recognition."""

    base_model = ResNet34(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

    x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(base_model.output)
    predictions = Dense(len(encoded_labels[0]), activation='softmax')(x)

    model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)

    for layer in model.layers[:]:
        if 'conv' not in layer.name:
            continue
        filters = layer.filters
        kernel_size = layer.kernel_size[0]
        strides = layer.strides[0]
        if kernel_size == 1 and strides == 1:
            continue
        layer.__setattr__('padding','same')
        layer.__setattr__('activation', None)
        branch = Conv2D(filters=filters // 4, kernel_size=1, padding='valid', activation='relu')(layer.output)
        conv_block = SeparableConvBlock(branch, filter_num=filters, kernel_size=kernel_size, stride=strides)
        layer._outbound_nodes = [layer._outbound_nodes[0]]
        layer._inbound_nodes = [layer._inbound_nodes[0]._replace(output_tensors=[conv_block])]
        layer._layers.append(conv_block)

    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    
    return model
```

Here, we first load the ResNet-34 architecture provided by Keras, which was pretrained on ImageNet dataset and includes a top layer of 1000 neurons for classification. We then remove the top layer and replace it with a dense layer with softmax activation, which matches the number of classes in our problem. Note that we freeze all the layers of the base ResNet-34 model so that we do not modify them during training. 

Next, we iterate over the remaining layers of the ResNet-34 model and check if they correspond to convolutional layers. We ignore any non-convolutional layers and skip any convolutional layers whose kernel size and stride are equal to 1 (to preserve dimensionality). Otherwise, we insert a separate convolution block (which contains a depthwise separable convolution followed by batch normalization and ReLU activations) after each convolutional layer. These inserted convolution blocks help to reduce the computational cost of later layers and improve performance slightly. We repeat this process until we reach the end of the model.

Finally, we compile the model with Adam optimizer, categorical cross-entropy loss, and accuracy metric. We then return the compiled model. 

Note that we did not tune any hyperparameters for this specific implementation of ResNet-34, but instead used default values recommended by the Keras documentation. Tuning these parameters could lead to improved performance on other datasets. Additionally, it may be worth trying alternative architectures such as MobileNet v2 or Xception, which provide faster speed and smaller model sizes than ResNet-34. Overall, though, the flexibility and ease of customization of ResNet-34 make it an excellent choice for many applications. 

Once we have defined our model architecture, we can now train it on our preprocessed dataset using the fit method of the model object. Here is the complete code for training the model:

```python
from keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping

# Load the preprocessed dataset
preprocessed_images, encoded_labels = load_preprocessed_dataset("data")

# Define the ResNet-34 model
model = create_model()

# Stop early if validation loss stops improving
earlystopper = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=3, verbose=1)

# Train the model
history = model.fit(preprocessed_images, encoded_labels, epochs=100, batch_size=32, 
                    callbacks=[earlystopper], validation_split=0.2)
```

Here, we set the number of epochs to 100, set the batch size to 32, and stop training early if the validation loss does not improve for 3 consecutive epochs. We split our preprocessed dataset into training and validation sets with a ratio of 80:20 using the `validation_split` parameter of the fit method. During training, we monitor the validation loss and save the best models achieved during training according to this metric using the callback mechanism provided by Keras. 

After completing the training procedure, we can plot the training and validation losses obtained during training to assess the convergence of the model:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(history.history['loss'], label='Training Loss')
plt.plot(history.history['val_loss'], label='Validation Loss')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

Our final model is now ready for testing on new data!



# 5. 模型测试
Now that we have finished training our model, we can evaluate its performance on new data. We start by loading the test dataset and obtaining the preprocessed test images and their corresponding labels. Then we predict the probabilities of each test image belonging to each class using the predict method of the model object:

```python
# Load the test dataset
test_imgs, test_labels = load_preprocessed_dataset("test")

# Predict the probabilities of each test image belonging to each class
probs = model.predict(test_imgs)
```

However, note that the prediction probabilities produced by our model are not directly interpretable as confidence scores. Rather, we need to convert the probability values into class predictions based on a given threshold, usually chosen to maximize balanced error rate and minimum False Alarm Rate. There are several ways to accomplish this conversion, depending on our requirements. Here, we will introduce two common methods: decision rule and optimal matching. 



## 5.1 Decision Rule Method

To implement this decision rule, we first sort the probability values in descending order and select the index of the maximum probability for each class. We then assign a score to each test image based on whether the class with the highest probability exceeds the chosen threshold. For example, if the second class has a probability greater than or equal to the threshold, we assign a score of 1. Similarly, if the third class has a probability less than the threshold, we assign a score of -1.

For instance, say we have five classes {A, B, C, D, E} and suppose the predicted probability matrix for a single test image looks like this:

| Class | Probability |
|:------:|:-----------:|
|   A    |     0.9     |
|   B    |     0.1     |
|   C    |     0.8     |
|   D    |     0.05    |
|   E    |     0.3     |

If the chosen threshold is 0.5, we might assign the following scores:

Image 1: Score = 1 (-1 > 0.5)
Image 2: Score = 1 (-0.9 > 0.5)
Image 3: Score = 1 (-0.8 > 0.5)
Image 4: Score = -1 (-0.3 <= 0.5)
Image 5: Score = -1 (-0.05 <= 0.5)

Then, we count the number of positive and negative examples and calculate the overall score as follows:

TP = 1 (+1)
TN = 4 (-1 + -1 + -1 + 0.3 + -0.05)
Score = TP - TN = 1 - 4 = -3

Alternatively, we can use the formula derived from Precision and Recall:

Precision = TP/(TP+FP)
Recall = TP/(TP+FN)
Score = F1-score*2/(Recall+Precision)*100 

where FP represents the number of false positives, FN represents the number of false negatives, and F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Both of these formulas give similar scores. 

Both of these scoring schemes require choosing a suitable threshold, but they differ in terms of how they handle ties between positive and negative examples. Indecision boundary (IB) analysis can be performed to find the optimal threshold along with IB points corresponding to the optimal match and mismatches, which shows how well the model is able to classify examples according to the actual distribution of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 



## 5.2 Optimal Match Method
Another approach is to treat the probability values as ranking scores for selecting the correct class, rather than directly assigning a score to each example. This allows us to take advantage of the relative ordering of the predicted probabilities to determine the appropriate selection strategy.

First, we sort the probability values in descending order and group them together according to their magnitude. Let's call this grouping process "binning". For example, consider the probabilities {0.9, 0.1, 0.8, 0.05}. After binning, we get the following groups: [(0.9, 0.8, 0.1)] and [(0.05)]. Within each group, we rank the classes by decreasing probability, giving us [[E, D], [C]]. 

Second, we pair up classes within adjacent bins using heuristics, such as requiring that the paired classes share a significant portion of overlap in their probability distributions. Let's call this pairing process "pairing". For example, considering the previous probabilities, we cannot easily pair the first two groups without losing too much information, so we decide to only allow pairs among the same group, i.e., between [B, C] and [E]. 

Third, we combine the resulting pairs into larger clusters by comparing their associated probabilities. Let's call this combination process "clustering". Using the clustering result, we assign each test image to the cluster with the highest probability mass, treating the probabilistic assignments as votes cast by experts.

Overall, this approach uses a wide range of statistical techniques to balance the trade-off between covering the majority of true positives while minimizing the impact of missing relevant items. However, the main challenge lies in ensuring sufficient diversity and representativeness of the selected pairs and clusters to prevent the model from becoming biased towards easy cases or discriminatory patterns. 



# 6. 未来展望
In conclusion, we have discussed how to design and implement a face recognition system using deep neural networks. We started by introducing fundamental concepts and technical tools used in computer vision, and went on to describe the core components of our face recognition system, including data preparation and preprocessing, model training and optimization, and model evaluation. We demonstrated two common strategies for converting predicted probabilities into useful outcomes, namely decision rule and optimal matching, and showed how these approaches enable us to evaluate the performance of our model and optimize its behavior. Despite its simplicity, our face recognition system demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in recognizing human faces with reasonable accuracy. Nevertheless, further improvements can still be made to increase its accuracy and robustness to real-world scenarios.
