# 1.简介
  

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning that enables an agent to learn how to interact with an environment by trial-and-error actions in order to maximize reward over time. One popular family of RL algorithms are model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL), which do not require the knowledge or modeling of the transition dynamics between states or the underlying system being controlled. These algorithms use only experience, which is gathered through interaction with the environment. The most promising approach for continuous control problems is deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). 

In this article, we will review some basic concepts and terminologies related to MFRL for continuous control tasks, explain DDPG algorithm and its implementation, discuss various applications of DDPG, and present some future research challenges. We hope that our explanations can help beginners understand the field better, as well as researchers who want to further develop their skills in this area. Let's get started! 

# 2.基本概念术语
## 2.1 Markov Decision Process(MDP)
The MDP framework provides a mathematical description of sequential decision making under uncertainty. It defines the set of possible states, the available actions at each state, the immediate rewards obtained from taking each action, and the probability distribution of next states given current state and action. 



A MDP consists of four components - S: the set of states, A: the set of actions, P: the state transition probabilities, R: the expected rewards. In general, when solving an MDP, one starts with an initial state s_0, then takes an action a_t, receives a reward r_t, transitions to the next state s_{t+1} according to the transition probabilities P(s_{t+1}|s_t,a_t), and continues until the episode ends. This process repeats itself infinitely many times until the agent reaches a terminal state s_T. There may also be discounting factors that indicate the importance of future rewards compared to the current reward.

## 2.2 Policy
The policy is a mapping from the state space to the action space. It specifies what action the agent should take in each state. For example, if the goal is to move a cart pole, a reasonable policy might be to keep it balanced as much as possible while moving towards the center of the track. Another policy could be to choose random actions at each state with small probability, ensuring exploration. 

## 2.3 Value Function
The value function V(s) gives us the expected long-term return starting from state s, i.e., the sum of all expected returns over multiple steps. Mathematically, it represents the maximum expected total reward starting from state s and acting optimally wrt the current policy π. It can be estimated using the Bellman equation:

V(s) = E[R + gamma * max_{a'}(Q(s',a')) | s]
where Q(s',a') is the predicted total reward starting from state s' after taking action a'. Note that gamma is the discount factor, which determines how important future rewards are relative to the current reward. Higher values of gamma lead to more weight placed on later rewards, whereas lower values place greater emphasis on immediate reward. 

## 2.4 Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient(DDPG) Algorithm
DDPG is a model-free, off-policy actor-critic method based on deep neural networks. It combines ideas from DQN (Deep Q Network) and policy gradients. DDPG uses two separate neural networks, called the Actor network and the Critic network, to estimate the optimal policy and the value function respectively. Each network predicts the best action to take in a particular state.

The Actor network learns the optimal policy π, which maximizes the expected total reward starting from any given state s using stochastic sampling. At each step t, the Actor samples an action a_t from π(a|s) using the latest version of the weights theta^π. Then it applies the action to the environment to observe the next state s_{t+1}, reward r_t, and whether the episode has ended. The Actor updates its parameters Θ^π using backpropagation through the sampled action.

The Critic network estimates the value function V(s) using temporal difference (TD) error estimation. At each timestep t, the Critic evaluates the quality of the action taken by the Actor during that step. If the action was good, the critic gets a positive TD error; otherwise, it gets a negative TD error. It uses these errors to update its parameter vector Θ^V accordingly.

Both networks work together to improve their respective performance, using Experience Replay techniques to handle online learning scenarios where data is collected incrementally. 

# 3.DDPG Implementation Details
Let’s now implement DDPG algorithm using PyTorch library. 

Firstly, let’s define the Environment class, which will simulate the physical system we are controlling. Here, we will create a simple pendulum environment consisting of a massless rod attached to a point mass with frictional damping. The equations governing motion are derived from the equations of motion of the inverted pendulum, but have been simplified somewhat. We will train the Agent to swing up the pendulum from rest while maintaining zero angular velocity. The input to the environment is the angle from vertical and the angular velocity about the pivot axis, and the output is the torque applied to the cart. 

```python
import torch
from gym import Env

class SwingUpEnv(Env):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        
        # Define system parameters 
        self.masscart = 1.0   # mass of the cart (kg)
        self.masspole = 0.1   # mass of the pole (kg)
        self.total_mass = (self.masspole + self.masscart)   # total mass (kg)
        self.length = 0.5     # length of the pole (meter)
        self.polemass_length = (self.masspole * self.length)    # half mass times pole length (kg m)

        # Define hyperparameters
        self.force_mag = 10.0       # magnitude of gravity (N)
        self.tau = 0.02              # seconds between state updates

    def _step(self, action):
        """Update the state of the pendulum."""
        th, thdot = self.state   # th := theta (angle from vertical)
                                # thdot := angular velocity about the pivot axis
        
        g = np.array([0.0, -self.force_mag])
        c, s = np.cos(th), np.sin(th)
        temp = (g * self.masspole * c) / (self.total_mass * self.length**2) + \
               (-self.polemass_length * s * thdot**2 * c -
                0.5 * self.length * self.masspole * (s**2 * c**2 + 2*self.masscart)) / (self.total_mass * self.length)
        tau = ((action + self.polemass_length * s * c * thdot ** 2 + 
                0.5 * self.length * self.masspole * (s**2 * c**2 - 1)))/self.total_mass
        tau += temp
            
        # Update the state variables using Euler's Method
        self.last_u = u
        newthdot = thdot + (-3*g/(2*self.length) + 3./(self.masspole*self.length**2)*temp - 1./(self.total_mass * self.length))*self.tau
        newth = th + newthdot*self.tau
        self.state = np.array([newth, newthdot])

        observation = np.array([np.cos(self.state[0]), np.sin(self.state[0]), self.state[1]])
        reward = np.cos(self.state[0])
        done = False
        
        info = {}
        
        return observation, reward, done, info
    
    def reset(self):
        """Reset the simulation to its initial conditions."""
        self.state = np.array([np.pi, 0])
        self.last_u = None
        
    def render(self):
        pass
```

Next, we need to define the Actor and Critic networks. We will use three fully connected layers with ReLU activation functions. 

```python
class ActorNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_inputs, num_outputs):
        super(ActorNet, self).__init__()
        
        self.net = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(num_inputs, 400),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(400, 300),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(300, num_outputs),
            nn.Tanh()
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.net(x)
    
class CriticNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_inputs, num_actions):
        super(CriticNet, self).__init__()
        
        self.net = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(num_inputs+num_actions, 400),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(400, 300),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(300, 1)
        )

    def forward(self, xs, a):
        cat_input = torch.cat((xs, a), dim=1)
        qvalue = self.net(cat_input)
        return qvalue
```

We also need to define the DDPGAgent class, which includes methods for training, updating weights, computing target Q values, and computing loss.  

```python
class DDPGAgent():
    def __init__(self, env):
        self.env = env
        
        # Initialize actor and critic networks
        self.actor = ActorNet(num_inputs=2, num_outputs=1)
        self.critic = CriticNet(num_inputs=2, num_actions=1)

        # Load saved models if they exist
        try:
            self.actor.load_state_dict(torch.load('model/ddpg_actor.pt'))
            self.critic.load_state_dict(torch.load('model/ddpg_critic.pt'))
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print("Trained models not found.")
            
        # Use CUDA if GPU available
        device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
        self.device = torch.device(device)
        self.actor.to(self.device)
        self.critic.to(self.device)

        # Create optimizer objects for both networks
        self.actor_optimizer = optim.Adam(self.actor.parameters())
        self.critic_optimizer = optim.Adam(self.critic.parameters())

        # Define replay buffer object
        self.buffer = Buffer(buffer_size=100000, batch_size=64, seed=0)
    
    def compute_target_qvals(self, next_states, rewards):
        """Compute the target Q values used for training"""
        # Get the Q-values predicted by the target critic for the next states
        with torch.no_grad():
            targets = self.target_critic(next_states, self.target_actor(next_states)).squeeze().detach()
            
            # Compute the target Q values
            targets *= GAMMA
            targets += rewards

            # Add noise to target Q values to encourage exploration
            targets += NOISE*torch.randn(targets.shape, device=self.device)

        return targets

    def train_model(self, experiences):
        """Train the actor and critic networks"""
        # Extract the relevant elements from the experiences tuple
        obs_batch, acts_batch, rews_batch, next_obs_batch, dones_batch = experiences

        # Train the critic network
        pred_qs = self.critic(obs_batch, acts_batch)
        targets = self.compute_target_qvals(next_obs_batch, rews_batch)
        critic_loss = F.mse_loss(pred_qs, targets)
        self.critic_optimizer.zero_grad()
        critic_loss.backward()
        self.critic_optimizer.step()

        # Train the actor network
        pi = self.actor(obs_batch)
        qs = self.critic(obs_batch, pi)
        actor_loss = -torch.mean(qs)
        self.actor_optimizer.zero_grad()
        actor_loss.backward()
        self.actor_optimizer.step()

        # Update the target networks
        soft_update(self.target_actor, self.actor, TAU)
        soft_update(self.target_critic, self.critic, TAU)

    def update_weights(self, experiences):
        """Add the experience to the buffer and update weights periodically"""
        self.buffer.add(experiences)

        if len(self.buffer) >= MINIBATCH_SIZE:
            mini_batch = self.buffer.sample()
            self.train_model(mini_batch)

    def save_models(self):
        """Save trained models"""
        torch.save(self.actor.state_dict(),'model/ddpg_actor.pt')
        torch.save(self.critic.state_dict(),'model/ddpg_critic.pt')
```

Now we can put everything together into a main function that runs the simulation and trains the agent. Finally, we plot the results and evaluate the performance of the agent. 

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    MAX_EPISODES = 1000         # Maximum number of episodes to run
    EPSILON = 1.0               # Initial epsilon value (chance to explore)

    TAU = 0.001                 # Soft target update parameter
    GAMMA = 0.99                # Discount factor
    NOISE = 0.1                 # Exploration noise

    # Create environment and agent
    env = SwingUpEnv()
    agent = DDPGAgent(env)

    scores = []                    # List to store scores per episode
    scores_window = deque(maxlen=100)        # Last 100 scores
    epsilons = []                   # List to store epsilon values
    avg_scores = []                 # Average score per 100 episodes

    # Main loop
    for i_episode in range(MAX_EPISODES):
        state = env.reset()
        score = 0                            # Score for this episode

        while True:
            # Select action depending on epsilon greedy policy
            epsilon = EPSILON if i_episode > EPSILON_DELAY else EPSILON*(EPSILON_START-EPSILON_END)/(EPSILON_DELAY)*(i_episode-EPSILON_DELAY)+EPSILON_END
            action = agent.act(state, epsilon)

            # Take action in environment and receive new state and reward
            next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)

            # Store experience in replay buffer
            agent.replay_memory.push(state, action, reward, next_state, done)

            # Update state and add score to cumulative score variable
            state = next_state
            score += reward

            # Perform one step of the optimization (on the target network)
            if i_episode % UPDATE_FREQ == 0:
                agent.learn()

            if done:
                break

        # Append scores and epsilon values to their corresponding lists
        scores.append(score)
        scores_window.append(score)
        epsilons.append(epsilon)

        average_score = np.mean(scores_window)
        avg_scores.append(average_score)

        # Print information every 100 episodes
        if i_episode % 100 == 0:
            print('\rEpisode {}\tAverage Score: {:.2f}\tepsilon: {:.2f}'.format(i_episode, average_score, epsilon))

        # Save trained models after every 500 episodes
        if i_episode % 500 == 0:
            agent.save_models()

    # Plot the scores
    fig = plt.figure()
    ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
    plt.plot(np.arange(len(avg_scores)), avg_scores)
    plt.ylabel('Average Score')
