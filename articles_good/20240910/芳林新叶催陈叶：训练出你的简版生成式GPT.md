##### Implement a Stack using Linked List
**Question:** How would you implement a stack using a linked list in Python?

**Answer:**
To implement a stack using a linked list in Python, we can define a `Node` class to represent each node in the linked list and a `Stack` class to manage the stack operations.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None

class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.top = None
        self.size = 0

    def is_empty(self):
        return self.top is None

    def push(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        new_node.next = self.top
        self.top = new_node
        self.size += 1

    def pop(self):
        if self.is_empty():
            raise IndexError("pop from empty stack")
        value = self.top.value
        self.top = self.top.next
        self.size -= 1
        return value

# Example usage
stack = Stack()
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
stack.push(3)
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 3
```

**Explanation:**
In this implementation, the `Node` class represents each node in the linked list, containing a value and a reference to the next node. The `Stack` class manages the stack operations, with `push()` to add an element to the top of the stack and `pop()` to remove the top element. The `is_empty()` method checks if the stack is empty.

##### Merge Sort
**Question:** Implement the Merge Sort algorithm in Python.

**Answer:**
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into smaller halves, sorts them, and then merges them back together.

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr

    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])

    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    i = j = 0

    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] < right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1

    result.extend(left[i:])
    result.extend(right[j:])

    return result

# Example usage
arr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]
sorted_arr = merge_sort(arr)
print(sorted_arr)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
```

**Explanation:**
The `merge_sort()` function recursively divides the input array into halves until each subarray contains only one element. The `merge()` function then combines these sorted subarrays into a single sorted array. The process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

##### Loss Functions in Machine Learning
**Question:** What are the main types of loss functions in machine learning and how do they work?

**Answer:**
Loss functions are essential components of machine learning algorithms that measure the discrepancy between the predicted output and the actual output. Here are three common types of loss functions:

1. **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 
   - Formula: `MSE = 1/n * Σ(y - y')^2`, where `y` is the actual output, `y'` is the predicted output, and `n` is the number of observations.
   - Interpretation: Measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted outputs.

2. **Categorical Cross-Entropy:**
   - Formula: `Entropy = -1/n * Σ(y * log(y'))`, where `y` is the one-hot encoded actual output and `y'` is the predicted probability distribution.
   - Interpretation: Quantifies the information loss when predicting a categorical outcome.

3. **Hinge Loss:**
   - Formula: `Loss = max(0, 1 - y * y')`, where `y` is the actual output (0 or 1) and `y'` is the predicted probability.
   - Interpretation: Encourages the model to classify points with high confidence, minimizing the margin.

**Explanation:**
Loss functions play a crucial role in optimizing machine learning models. They guide the optimization process by providing a measure of how well the model is performing. Different loss functions are suitable for different types of problems, and understanding their properties is essential for selecting the appropriate function.
