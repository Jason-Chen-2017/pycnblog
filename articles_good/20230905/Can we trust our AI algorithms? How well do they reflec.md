# 2.基本概念术语说明
Before diving into the core aspects of artificial intelligence, let’s take a look at some essential terminologies and basic concepts. These terms will make the articles easier to read and follow along. 


## Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
Natural Language Processing, commonly referred to as NLP, is the branch of computer science dealing with the interactions between computers and human languages. It involves the design of computational models that can analyze and manipulate language data to produce meaningful insights. This process allows software developers to create programs that can understand, generate, and respond to human language effectively.  

Here are the fundamental principles behind natural language processing:

1. Data representation: A variety of encoding schemes exist, depending on the level of abstraction required for analysis. For example, ASCII or Unicode standards allow us to represent characters as binary numbers, while word embeddings employ learned representations that capture semantic meaning of words. 

2. Tokenization: Text is first segmented into individual tokens or units. These units may correspond to words, phrases, paragraphs, or even sentences. The goal of tokenization is to remove unwanted noise from the input data, such as punctuation marks and stopwords like “the,” “a,” “an.”  

3. Stemming vs Lemmatization: Both stemming and lemmatization involve removing inflectional endings from words to obtain base forms. There are several variations of both methods, but generally speaking, stemming works better when applied to English words, while lemmatization performs better when applied to non-English languages or compound words.   

4. Part-of-speech tagging: Each word is assigned a part-of-speech tag that indicates its grammatical role within a sentence. This helps in analyzing syntax patterns and facilitates further text processing tasks.  

5. Dependency parsing: This technique identifies relationships between words in a sentence and connects them together into a tree structure. This makes it possible to extract more informative features than simple tokenization alone.  

## Supervised Learning (SL) vs Unsupervised Learning (UL)
Supervised learning refers to the task of training a model by providing labeled training data where the desired output is already known. The aim is to learn a mapping function that takes inputs x and produces outputs y that approximate the correct answer given the input. During training, the model updates itself to minimize the difference between predicted values and actual values during testing. Examples of supervised learning include spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and predictive modeling.

Unsupervised learning refers to the task of training a model without any labelled data. Instead, the model must identify underlying structures in the data and then apply appropriate transformations to group similar instances together. Clustering, topic modelling, and anomaly detection fall under this category.

## Deep Learning (DL) vs Shallow Learning (SL)
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that employs multiple layers of computation to enable complex feature extraction from raw data. Neural networks, specifically, have been shown to perform very well in deep learning tasks.

Shallow learning, on the other hand, applies traditional machine learning algorithms directly to high-dimensional data sets. Traditional machine learning algorithms typically rely heavily on linear algebra, probability theory, and optimization techniques.

## Reinforcement Learning (RL) vs Supervised Learning (SL)
Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning that seeks to train agents to maximize rewards over time by interacting with an environment. Agents receive feedback through observations, actions, and reward signals. The objective is to learn policies that enable the agent to select actions that result in the highest expected long-term reward. Examples of RL include robotics, autonomous vehicles, and game playing.

On the other hand, SL seeks to train models to map inputs x to corresponding outputs y that exactly match observed outcomes. In contrast, RL trains models to optimize a loss function that maps state transitions and actions to scalar rewards.

## Data Augmentation and Regularization
Data augmentation is a common technique used to increase the size of a dataset by creating new samples derived from existing ones. The approach involves generating new training examples by applying small random transformations to the original images. This procedure enables the network to generalize better to unseen environments.

Regularization is a process of adding a penalty term to a cost function that discourages the weights from becoming too large. This ensures that the network stays robust against noise and increases the stability of the learning process. Two regularization techniques frequently used in DL are weight decay and dropout.


# 3.Core Algorithms and Math Formulas
Now, let’s move on to the core components of artificial intelligence. We'll start with a quick review of decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines. Then, we'll dive deeper into the math behind the algorithms, starting with linear regression and logistic regression. After that, we'll explore convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. Finally, we'll talk about reinforcement learning.

### Decision Trees
Decision trees are a type of supervised learning algorithm that operate by recursively partitioning the predictor space into regions based on attribute value combinations. The final leaf nodes contain class labels while the internal nodes represent attribute tests. Each split represents a rule specifying an attribute test condition, resulting in either true or false branches.


#### Mathematical Formula
A decision tree is defined as follows:

```
if Attribute[i] <= T[i]:
   goto left[i]
else:
   goto right[i]
```

where i denotes the attribute index, `Attribute[i]` is the i-th attribute value encountered so far, `T[i]` is a threshold value chosen for splitting the attribute, and `left` and `right` are subtrees rooted at the child nodes created by the split.

To calculate the information gain gained by the split, we need to compute the entropy before and after the split:

```
H(D) = - Σ pi * log2 pi      // entropy of D before split
H(D|A=a) = H(D') + Σ p(a)*log2 p(a)     // conditional entropy after split
gain = H(D) - H(D|A=a)        // information gain
```

We want to choose splits that lead to nodes with maximum information gain. Therefore, we can define the Gini impurity measure as follows:

```
G(D|A) = Σ [(pi)*(1-pi)]^2    // Gini impurity measure
```

With this formula, we can evaluate the optimal split for a particular attribute `A`. To do this efficiently, we can build a decision tree incrementally, choosing the best split for each remaining node until all leaves belong to the same class or no further improvement is achieved.

For continuous attributes, we can use histogram bins to construct discrete intervals and assign each interval to one of the two child nodes. Alternatively, we can use quantile regression to estimate the conditional distribution of each bin and use it to determine the best split point.

### Linear Regression and Logistic Regression
Linear regression and logistic regression are classic statistical methods for fitting a line or sigmoid curve to a set of points in order to model the relationship between a dependent variable and independent variables. They share many characteristics such as working well when the relationship is approximately linear, requiring little prior knowledge of the functional form, and having low bias and variance errors.

Both methods attempt to fit a line or sigmoid curve to the data points by minimizing a sum of squared error (SSE) or cross-entropy error (CEE), respectively. Here are the equations:

#### Linear Regression
Linear regression assumes that the response variable Y depends linearly on the predictor variable X. The model equation is:

Y = b0 + b1X

where b0 and b1 are constants that represent the intercept and slope of the regression line, respectively. The least squares method is used to estimate the parameters b0 and b1:

b0 = mean(y) − b1*mean(x)
b1 = nΣ[(xi−mean(x))*(yi−mean(y))] / (nΣ[(xi−mean(x))^2])

#### Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a special case of linear regression used when the outcome variable is categorical. The model equation is:

P(Y=1|X) = e^(b0+b1X)/(1+e^(b0+b1X))

where P(Y=1|X) is the probability that the outcome variable equals 1 given the predictor variable X. The CEE or log-likelihood function is used to estimate the parameters b0 and b1:

L(b0,b1) = Σ[-y*log(p) -(1-y)*log(1-p)]
        = Σ[y*log(1+e^(b0+b1X))+(1-y)*log(1+e^(-b0-b1X))]

Gradient descent is used to optimize the likelihood function.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of neural network architecture used for image classification tasks. CNNs consist of several convolutional layers followed by pooling layers and fully connected layers. The convolution operation uses filters to scan the input image, while the pooling layer reduces the spatial dimensions of the activation maps generated by the previous layer.

Each filter corresponds to a local pattern in the input image, and the convolution operation generates a set of activation maps that encode the presence or absence of the pattern. Multiple filters can be applied to the same input image to capture different visual features, leading to multi-layer representations of the input image.

After the convolutional layers, fully connected layers act as classifiers that take the flattened output of the last convolutional layer and classify the input image into one of the predefined classes. Popular architectures include VGG, ResNet, DenseNet, and SqueezeNet.

#### Mathematical Formulas
A typical CNN consists of several layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, normalization layers, and fully connected layers. Below is a summary of the mathematical formulas used in a single convolutional layer:

Input Image: `(W1×H1×C)`
Kernel Size: `(KW × KH)`
Output Channels: `K`
Stride: `(S1 × S2)`
Padding: `(P1 × P2)`

Convolve the kernel across the entire input image to produce an `(W2 × H2 × K)` output matrix where `W2`, `H2`, and `K` are computed as follows:

```
W2 = floor((W1 − KW + 2P)/S1) + 1       // width of output volume
H2 = floor((H1 − KH + 2P)/S2) + 1       // height of output volume
K = Output Channels                      // number of output channels
```

Apply the activation function (ReLU, softmax, etc.) element-wise to each channel in the output matrix to produce the activations for that layer. Optionally, add batch normalization or dropout to reduce overfitting and improve accuracy.

Pooling operations reduce the dimensionality of the output volumes by aggregating the activations within a region of interest. Common pooling operations include average pooling, max pooling, and global pooling. Pooling layers can be inserted between convolutional layers and after fully connected layers to control the complexity of the feature maps.

Normalization layers modify the output of the previous layer to ensure that its elements are centered around zero and have unit variance. Batch normalization scales the inputs to have zero mean and unit standard deviation, reducing the dependence on initialization and improves convergence speed and stability. Dropout randomly drops out some neurons during training to prevent co-adaptation of neurons and reduce overfitting.

Overall, CNNs are highly efficient for image classification tasks because they exploit hierarchical representations learned by the filters in each layer. The ability to adaptively adjust to varying conditions and extract relevant features makes them particularly effective at capturing contextual dependencies in natural images.

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network architecture used for sequential prediction tasks. RNNs work by passing input sequences step by step through hidden states and updating them according to the current input. Hidden states carry information from the past to influence the next predictions, making them powerful tools for sequence modeling.

There are three main types of RNN cells: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Elman RNN. LSTM cells maintain separate forget gate and input gate mechanisms that permit each component to interact with the cell state independently. GRU cells simplify the LSTM mechanism by combining the update and reset gates. Elman RNN cells are simpler and faster than LSTM and GRU cells.

After the input sequences pass through RNN cells, they are fed back into the network to update their hidden states and generate predictions for the next timestep. Sequence generation tasks require attention mechanisms to focus on important parts of the input sequence and avoid attending to irrelevant elements. Attention mechanisms can be implemented using multiplicative attention, dot product attention, or self-attention.

#### Mathematical Formulas
A typical RNN cell consists of four major components: input gate, forget gate, memory cell, and output gate. The input gate controls the flow of information into the cell state, while the forget gate controls the flow of information out of the cell state. The memory cell stores incoming information and passes it on to the next timestep. The output gate determines the output of the cell by taking into account the content stored in the cell state and the output of the previous timestep.

These components are combined to generate a new hidden state at each timestep based on the input and previous hidden state. At the beginning of the sequence, the initial hidden state can be initialized randomly, while in practice, it is usually updated using the output of the previous timestep. Backpropagation through time (BPTT) is used to train RNNs by computing gradients using the chain rule and propagating them backwards through the network to the input weights.

### Reinforcement Learning (RL)
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that seeks to teach an agent to maximize a cumulative reward signal over time. The agent interacts with an environment by selecting actions, observing rewards, and receiving feedback. The goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected return, which is the total reward obtained over the course of the episode. RL agents can range from simple prototypical behaviors to complex hierarchical decision-making systems.

RL problems can be categorized into continuous action spaces or discrete action spaces. Continuous action spaces have smooth, bounded values representing forces and torques applied to physical objects, while discrete action spaces have limited options, such as moving up, down, left, or right.

Value functions provide a way to measure the quality of the decisions made by an agent. The value function measures the expected future reward if the agent chooses an action at a particular state. Q-learning is a commonly used method to learn the Q-value function for a particular state-action pair.

Policy gradient methods guide the agent towards a target policy by updating the probabilities of each action taken according to the gradient of the expected return with respect to the policy parameters. Policy gradient methods are widely used for continuous control tasks such as robotics and game playing.

Advantage actor-critic (A2C) is another method used for training RL agents that combines policy gradient methods with a critic network to balance exploration and exploitation. The critic evaluates the value of each state and provides additional guidance to the policy network. A2C is often preferred compared to DDPG due to its faster training times.
