Web scraping is a technique used to extract large amounts of data from websites and other online resources. It involves extracting information from HTML pages or XML documents and storing them in structured formats such as CSV (comma separated values) files, databases or spreadsheets. In this article we will see how to use the popular BeautifulSoup library for web scraping in Python. 

BeautifulSoup is a powerful Python package that makes it easy to scrape websites. The basic idea behind web scraping is to send HTTP requests to a website and retrieve its contents using an API or by parsing the HTML code. We can then analyze these contents to extract specific elements of interest. BeautifulSoup provides several methods and functions for navigating, searching, and modifying HTML/XML trees. Finally, we can store our extracted data in various formats including JSON, CSV, or even a database. This allows us to perform complex analysis on the retrieved information, which could be useful in many applications.

In summary, web scraping offers great potential for gathering vast amounts of data and analyzing it quickly. However, it requires careful planning and technical expertise, and proper coding skills. With the right tools and techniques, anyone can start their own projects with ease. 

We will follow the steps below to build a simple program to scrape data from a website:

1. Install required packages
2. Import necessary modules
3. Connect to the website's URL
4. Send a GET request
5. Parse the response content using BeautifulSoup
6. Extract desired information
7. Save the results in CSV format

Let's get started! 

# 2.基本概念术语说明
## 2.1 What is web scraping?
Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites using computer programming languages like Python. It involves sending HTTP requests to web servers to download their pages' source codes, which are written in HTML (HyperText Markup Language), and parsing the HTML code to extract relevant information. Common uses include data mining, stock market research, news articles monitoring, social media analytics, etc.

## 2.2 Why should I web scrape my data?
One reason why people want to collect and analyze data from websites is because they have valuable knowledge and insights that can be obtained through scrapping their information. For instance, businesses often keep track of sales figures, competitor prices, customer feedback, employee salaries, etc., which can be analyzed to determine trends, identify patterns, make predictions, or improve business operations. Another example would be scientific researchers who wish to monitor the latest findings related to a particular topic. Instead of spending hours manually scrolling through webpages, they can automate the process by developing scripts that constantly crawl updated data sources.

Another important benefit of web scraping is the speed at which data can be collected compared to traditional methods of data collection. Since most websites update their information frequently, web scraping enables organizations to quickly obtain up-to-date data without having to wait for humans to do it manually. Additionally, web scraping allows companies to gain access to a larger amount of unstructured data than can otherwise be achieved through manual data collection efforts.

Finally, web scraping is becoming increasingly common due to the rise of social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, where data can be easily accessed via APIs. Web scraping also has some ethical considerations associated with its use, especially when it comes to collecting sensitive information like user comments and ratings on products or services. Nevertheless, the benefits of web scraping outweigh any potential risks and challenges.

## 2.3 What is BeautifulSoup?
BeautifulSoup is a popular Python library for web scraping. It works by converting a webpage’s HTML into a parseable object called a "soup," which you can search, navigate, and modify using a variety of built-in methods and functions. Here are some key features of BeautifulSoup: 

1. Easy to Use: The syntax for navigating and manipulating a soup is intuitive and similar to working with standard Python objects. 
2. Powerful Search Methods: BeautifulSoup supports powerful search methods such as find_all(), find(), and select() to locate tags and attributes in the document tree. These methods allow you to effectively filter and extract information from your target webpage(s). 
3. Flexible Parsing Techniques: BeautifulSoup can handle both text-based and binary content types, making it suitable for handling web pages regardless of whether they're static or dynamic. 
4. Well-Documented Code Base: BeautifulSoup's documentation includes clear explanations of each method and function, providing a comprehensive guide for beginners and experienced developers alike.

## 2.4 What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is the markup language used to structure and display web pages on the World Wide Web. Its primary purpose is to provide a means for creating hyperlinks between different documents, images, videos, and other multimedia content on the internet. HTML consists of a series of nested "elements" enclosed within opening and closing tags. Some commonly used tags include <head>, <title>, <body>, <h1> - <h6>, <p>, <a>, <img>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, and others. Each tag indicates a different type of content, and each element may have additional properties specified as name="value" pairs within the opening tag. 

Here is an example HTML page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Example Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">About Us</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Contact Us</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
      <div class="logo">
      </div>
    </header>
    
    <main>
      <section id="hero">
        <h1>Welcome to Our Website!</h1>
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
        <button>Learn More</button>
      </section>
      
      <section id="about">
        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Our company provides amazing services to our customers.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="services">
        <h2>Services</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Service 1</li>
          <li>Service 2</li>
          <li>Service 3</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
    </main>

    <footer>
      <p>&copy; 2021 Example Company</p>
    </footer>

  </body>
</html>
```

This page contains multiple sections of content including header, main, footer, and three sections containing hero, about, and services content. Each section is defined by an ID attribute inside its corresponding opening tag. You can view this page in your browser to see how it looks and interacts.

## 2.5 What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is used to style and layout web pages created with HTML. It defines styles for elements like headings, paragraphs, links, buttons, and more, allowing you to create visually appealing web pages that stand out amongst competing content. A stylesheet typically resides within an external file with a.css extension and is linked to a web page's HTML code using the link tag:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    <title>Example Page</title>
  </head>
 ...
</html>
```

The following is an example CSS stylesheet:

```css
/* Global Styles */
* {
  box-sizing: border-box; /* Set default box size */
  margin: 0; /* Remove default margin */
  padding: 0; /* Remove default padding */
}

/* Header Styles */
header {
  background-color: #333;
  color: #fff;
  height: 80px;
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
}

nav ul {
  list-style: none;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100%;
  max-width: 900px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

nav li {
  margin: 0 1rem;
}

nav a {
  color: #fff;
  text-decoration: none;
}

/* Main Content Area Styles */
main {
  min-height: calc(100vh - 80px);
  padding-top: 80px;
  background-color: #f9f9f9;
}

section h1, 
section p, 
section button {
  text-align: center;
}

/* Footer Styles */
footer {
  background-color: #333;
  color: #fff;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 20px 0;
  font-size: 14px;
}
```

This stylesheet sets global styles for all elements on the page, including setting default margins and padding to zero, as well as defining the colors and layout of the header, main content area, and footer areas. Specifically, it centers the text and adds horizontal spacing between navigation items.

You can customize this stylesheet to match the design of your site, adjusting fonts, colors, and other visual aspects to reflect your brand's preferences. By separating styling rules from the rest of the HTML code, you can ensure that your site maintains consistency across all pages while still allowing you to make minor modifications on a per-page basis if needed.

## 2.6 What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a client-side scripting language used mainly for web development. It is designed to add interactivity and functionality to web pages, but it can also be used to manipulate web pages directly using APIs. One common use case for JavaScript is event handling, which enables users to interact with web pages by triggering actions like form submission, image animation, or menu expansion. Although not as prevalent as server-side scripting languages like PHP or Ruby, JavaScript is widely used throughout the web development community and is critical to modern web development workflows.
