# 1.简介
  
 
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning technique that enables agents to learn from their environment and take actions accordingly in order to maximize their reward over time. It involves two main components: the agent, which learns through trial and error by taking actions based on its perceptions; and the environment, which provides the agent with feedback about how well it performed during each action taken. In recent years, RL has emerged as an important area of research due to its ability to solve complex problems such as robotics, control systems, and autonomous driving. 

In this article, we will explore the basic concepts, terminologies, algorithms and code for reinforcement learning using the open-source library `gym` and deep learning algorithm `Q-Learning`. We will also implement the same using Python programming language and train our model to solve multiple tasks like playing tic-tac-toe or finding the shortest path between two points using Dijkstra's algorithm. We hope this article can be useful for beginners who are interested in applying RL techniques to real-world applications and solving challenging problems.

 # 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology 
## Markov Decision Process (MDP) 
  A MDP is a mathematical framework used to describe sequential decision making problem. It consists of four key components:
  
   - **State**: Represents the current status of the system
   - **Action**: An input that changes the state of the system
   - **Reward**: The consequence of performing an action at a specific state
   - **Transition Probability Matrix**: Defines the probability of transitioning between different states depending upon the chosen action
   
Each state may have zero or more possible actions that lead to other states with distinct rewards. The goal of the agent is to find the optimal strategy that maximizes the cumulative reward obtained over time by following the policy.   

The fundamental idea behind MDPs lies in considering all possible future outcomes instead of just looking ahead one step. This way, the agent avoids overfitting and makes better decisions by taking into account all relevant information. It helps us to build robust AI systems that can adapt to new environments quickly and effectively.  

## Reward Function 
A reward function specifies the immediate reward received after executing an action in a given state. It takes the form of a scalar value that quantifies the importance of the event. The purpose of the reward function is to guide the agent towards achieving higher reward while avoiding suboptimal strategies. 

## Value Function 
Value function gives the expected long term return when the agent is in a particular state. It represents the utility of being in a certain state, and the act of optimizing the value function corresponds to finding the optimal policy.

## Policy Function 
Policy function determines the next action to be taken by the agent in a given state according to its preferences. It maps the current state to an action. The aim of policy gradient methods is to update the parameters of the policy network so that the output of the policy becomes closer to the desired target values.

## Bellman Equation  
The Bellman equation describes the relationship between the present value of the state (V) and the maximum expected future reward (Q). It tells us what is the best choice of action that can lead to the highest expected reward today. Using the Bellman equation allows us to calculate the value of each state without knowing the dynamics of the system beyond the current state. Thus, it helps to make better choices in predicting the future returns of the agent.    

We use the Bellman equation to iteratively compute the value function V and then choose the action that leads to the highest value at each step until convergence. Once converged, we can select the optimal policy that explores the most desirable directions within the state space and eventually reaches the maximum reward.

## Markov Property 
Markov property says that the future depends only on the current state and not on previous events. That means if we were in state s at time t and perform action a at time t+1, the resulting state st+1 is independent of all preceding states except s itself. 

## Discount Factor   
Discount factor is a parameter that controls the degree of focus placed on future rewards versus current ones. If the discount factor is high, the agent will care more about immediate rewards rather than later ones. On the contrary, if the discount factor is low, the agent will value current rewards more highly than potential future rewards. The value of discount factors range from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates no preference for future rewards and 0 indicates a commitment to current rewards only. By default, the discount factor is set to 1, but setting a lower value of discount factor typically results in more stable behavior.

# 3. Core Algorithm and Code Implementation 
In this section, we will see how to implement the core algorithm called "Q-learning" using Python and gym libraries. We will first install these libraries if necessary and then discuss the implementation details.
## Install Required Libraries ##
To implement Q-learning algorithm using Python, we need to import various libraries. Here are the steps to install them if they haven't been already installed:
    
1. Open command prompt or terminal window.
2. Type the following commands one by one and press enter.
     ```python
      pip install numpy
      pip install gym[atari]
      conda install tensorflow
     ```
       *Note*: Make sure you have both python 2.x and 3.x installed before running above commands. Depending on your OS, installation procedure may vary slightly.
       
       You should now be able to run the Q-learning algorithm on Atari games using Python. 
       
## Environment Setup 
Next, we setup the environment for training our agent. For this example, we will use the CartPole game provided by the gym library. This is a classic continuous control task that involves balancing a pole on a cart. There are two possible actions: left or right. The agent must balance the pole for as long as possible until the cart moves past a certain threshold distance. The longer the pole remains upright, the greater the agent’s total reward. To create the environment object, we simply call `gym.make()` method and pass `"CartPole-v0"` as argument. Also, we initialize the random number generator with a seed value to ensure reproducibility across experiments. Finally, we reset the environment to start the simulation process.
```python
import gym
env = gym.make('CartPole-v0')
env.seed(0)
state = env.reset()
```
## Agent Architecture 
Our agent architecture consists of three parts:

 - **State Estimator**: Takes in the raw observation from the environment and outputs a feature vector representation of the state.
 - **Action Selector**: Takes in the features extracted from the state estimator and produces an action to be executed by the agent.
 - **Agent Model**: Combines the state estimator and action selector together to produce the final output that the agent interacts with.  
 
For simplicity, we will consider a simple neural network for both the state estimator and action selector layers. We define these networks using the Keras library. Our agent class should look something like this:
```python
import keras
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Activation
class Agent:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.state_size = len(env.observation_space.high)
        self.action_size = env.action_space.n
        
        self.model = Sequential([
            Dense(16, input_dim=self.state_size, activation='relu'),
            Dense(16, activation='relu'),
            Dense(self.action_size, activation='linear')
        ])
        
    def get_action(self, state):
        state = np.reshape(state, [1, self.state_size])
        prediction = self.model.predict(state)[0]
        action = np.argmax(prediction)
        return action
    
    def train(self, replay_memory, batch_size, gamma):
        X_train, y_train = [], []
        
        minibatch = random.sample(replay_memory, batch_size)
        
        for state, action, reward, next_state, done in minibatch:
            
            if not done:
                target = reward + gamma*np.amax(self.model.predict(next_state)[0])
            else:
                target = reward
                
            predicted_q_value = self.model.predict(state)
            predicted_q_value[0][action] = target
            
            X_train.append(state[0])
            y_train.append(predicted_q_value[0])
            
        history = self.model.fit(np.array(X_train), np.array(y_train), epochs=1, verbose=0)
        
agent = Agent()
```      
Here, we first extract the size of the state space and action space from the environment object. Then, we define a neural network architecture consisting of two hidden layers with 16 neurons each. We use relu activation function on the first layer and linear activation function on the last layer since there is no sigmoid activation function in the CartPole environment. Lastly, we initialize the agent instance and provide helper functions for getting the next action and updating the model weights.

## Experience Replay 
Experience replay is a memory buffer that stores transitions generated by the agent interacting with the environment. Each transition contains a tuple containing the current state, action, reward, next state, and whether the episode has ended or not. Over time, the agent learns from the stored experiences by sampling batches randomly and recomputing the targets using the Bellman equation. The effectiveness of experience replay depends on the quality of the samples provided. Moreover, we sample mini-batches of fixed sizes for efficiency purposes.

```python
import collections
import random

class ReplayMemory:

    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.memory = collections.deque(maxlen=capacity)

    def push(self, transition):
        self.memory.append(transition)

    def sample(self, batch_size):
        return random.sample(self.memory, batch_size)

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.memory)
```       
We define a replay memory class that keeps track of the latest transitions and removes old ones once the buffer exceeds its capacity. The `push()` method adds a single transition to the buffer, whereas the `sample()` method generates a list of transitions of specified length.

## Hyperparameters 
Before starting the training loop, we need to specify several hyperparameters such as epsilon-greedy exploration rate, learning rate, discount factor, etc. These values determine the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation in the agent’s learning process. We also set up the minimum and maximum numbers of episodes to run the experiment.
```python
num_episodes = 500
min_steps_per_episode = 500
gamma = 0.95    
epsilon = 1.0
epsilon_decay = 0.995
epsilon_min = 0.01
batch_size = 32
alpha = 0.001

memory = ReplayMemory(50000)
```        
We define the number of episodes to run the experiment, the minimum number of steps required in each episode, the discount factor, and the initial values of epsilon, epsilon decay, and epsilon minimum. We also create a `ReplayMemory` object to store the experience transitions.

## Training Loop 
Finally, we start the training loop that runs for the specified number of episodes. Inside the loop, we first initialize a new episode and obtain the initial observation from the environment. Then, we iterate over each timestep until the episode ends or the agent reaches the maximum allowed steps. Within each iteration, we execute an action using either exploratory or greedy policy based on the current value of epsilon. Next, we obtain the next observation, reward, and whether the episode has finished, and add the corresponding tuple to the replay memory. After every n-th iteration, we sample a mini-batch of transitions from the replay memory and update the model weights using the sampled targets computed using the Bellman equation. When the episode ends, we reset the environment and continue with the next episode.
```python
for i in range(num_episodes):
    step = 0
    total_reward = 0
    state = env.reset()
    
    while True:
        step += 1
        
        if np.random.rand() <= epsilon:
            action = env.action_space.sample()
        else:
            action = agent.get_action(state)

        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        
        total_reward += reward
        
        if step > min_steps_per_episode:
            break
                
        memory.push((state, action, reward, next_state, done))
        
        state = next_state
        
        if step % 10 == 0:
            agent.train(memory, batch_size, gamma)
            
    epsilon *= epsilon_decay
    epsilon = max(epsilon_min, epsilon)
    
    print("Episode {}/{}, Steps: {}, Total Reward: {}".format(i+1, num_episodes, step, total_reward))
```      
Inside the outer loop, we initialize a new episode by resetting the environment and obtaining the initial observation. We keep incrementing the step counter until the agent reaches the maximum allowed number of steps (`min_steps_per_episode`) or completes the episode. Within each iteration, we check whether to explore or exploit the environment based on the current value of epsilon. We obtain the next observation, reward, and whether the episode has completed, and append the corresponding tuple `(s, a, r, s', done)` to the replay memory. We then move to the next state and repeat the process until the episode finishes or the agent reaches the limit on the number of steps. 

After every n-th iteration (where n is usually equal to 10), we update the agent model weights using the sampled mini-batch of transitions using the `train()` method defined earlier. We adjust the epsilon value dynamically based on the decay rate and minimum value to achieve the desired exploration-exploitation tradeoff. Finally, we print out the episode number, total number of steps taken, and the total reward earned in each episode.
