# 1.简介
  


Logistic regression is an algorithm that is widely used for binary classification problems. It assumes that the outcome variable has two possible outcomes: Yes or No, True or False, etc. In logistic regression, we assume that there exists a linear relationship between the predictor variables (also known as independent variables) and the log-odds of the outcome variable (also known as dependent variable). We estimate these parameters using maximum likelihood estimation method, which gives us the coefficients of each predictor variable along with their corresponding p values and t statistics. 

In this article, I will provide you with a step by step explanation on how to build a logistic regression model in R language from scratch. You will learn how to perform data preprocessing, feature selection, training the model, evaluation metrics, and make predictions based on new data instances. The final section will be dedicated to future directions and challenges faced in building logistic regression models. Finally, I will also include some common issues and solutions related to logistic regression such as overfitting and underfitting. 

 # 2.Background Introduction

Before we start our discussion, let's understand what exactly does it mean to perform logistic regression? According to Wikipedia, logistic regression is "a type of regression analysis used for predicting the probability of a binary response". To explain more about logistic regression, let's take an example of a hypothetical company named ABC Corp. Suppose they want to develop a marketing campaign for selling clothing online. They have collected several data points such as customer age, income, education level, marital status, gender, occupation, and whether they bought clothes before. Based on these features, they are trying to determine if a particular individual will buy clothes online or not. Since the target variable can only be either Yes or No, this problem requires logistic regression.

 # 3. Basic Concepts and Terminology 

## Types of Logistic Regression
There are three types of logistic regression:

1. Binary Logistic Regression: This type of logistic regression is suitable when there are only two possible outcomes i.e., yes or no, true or false, success or failure, etc. For instance, if we want to classify patients based on certain symptoms like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, etc., then this kind of regression would be useful.

2. Multi-class Logistic Regression: This type of logistic regression is useful when there are multiple categories to predict. It assumes that there are k classes where each class represents a different category. One popular use case of multi-class logistic regression is image recognition. Here, we want to identify which object belongs to which category.

3. Ordinal Logistic Regression: This type of logistic regression is used for situations where the outcome variable takes ordered values such as low, medium, high, very high, etc. We assume that there exist an underlying ordering among the levels of the ordinal variable. There may also be missing values present in the dataset due to interview questions being left blank or incorrect answers submitted. Ordinal logistic regression is usually performed after encoding the ordinal variable as numeric values.

 

## Terms used in Logistic Regression:

1. Dependent Variable (or Outcome Variable): The variable whose value depends upon the explanatory variables.

2. Independent Variables (or Predictor Variables): The variables that influence the outcome variable. These variables can be quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative variables measure attributes such as height, weight, salary, etc., while qualitative variables represent characteristics like gender, race, region, etc.

3. Likelihood Function: This function calculates the probability of the observed data given the values of the explanatory variables. The likelihood function is denoted by L(θ|x), where θ represents the parameter vector (the set of coefficient estimates) and x represents the data vector (the set of observations). The greater the likelihood function, the higher the chances of observing the given data.

4. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE): MLE involves finding the most probable values of the parameters (coefficients) that maximize the likelihood function. It is often done through numerical optimization methods like gradient descent or Newton's method.

5. Parameter Estimates (Coefficients): These are the estimated values of the slope and intercept terms obtained by fitting the logistic regression curve to the data.

6. Residuals: These are the differences between predicted values and actual values calculated during the fit procedure. If the residuals are normally distributed around zero, then the model is considered to be accurate enough to make predictions on new data instances.

7. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix provides a clear picture of how well the classifier performs on the test data. It shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, resulting from classifying the test data into various categories. It helps analyze both overall performance and focus on specific types of errors.

8. Precision and Recall: Precision measures the accuracy of positive prediction, whereas recall measures the ability of the classifier to find all positive examples. High precision means fewer false positives, but potentially more false negatives. Similarly, high recall means fewer false negatives, but potentially more false positives.

9. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve: This plot displays the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity measures the proportion of true positives out of the total number of actual positives, while specificity measures the proportion of true negatives out of the total number of actual negatives. AUC stands for Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve, and it indicates the area underneath the ROC curve.

 

## Assumptions made in Logistic Regression:

1. Linear Relationship Between Features: The relationships between the features should be approximately linear. If there is a curved relationship, non-linear transformations need to be applied to convert them into a linear form.

2. Normal Distribution of Residuals: The distribution of the error terms must be normal or nearly normal so that inference can be made. If the error term follows any other distribution, the results might not be valid.

3. Homoscedasticity: Homoscedasticity refers to equal variance across the range of predictor variable values. Violations of homoscedasticity can cause biases in the coefficient estimates.

4. Large Sample Size: The sample size needs to be large enough for reliable coefficient estimates.

5. Non-Collinearity: Logistic regression assumes that the features are not highly correlated. If collinearity exists, it can result in poor model performance. Collinearity can be tested using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) values.

 

 
# 4. Steps involved in Building Logistic Regression Models in R  

## Step 1: Import Libraries and Load Dataset
First, we need to load the necessary libraries and load the dataset into our workspace. For demonstration purposes, I am going to use the iris dataset that is included in R by default. However, you can replace it with your own dataset. 

```R
library(ggplot2)    # Data visualization library
library(glmnet)     # Library for feature selection and regularization techniques
library(caret)      # Library for cross validation functions
library(pROC)       # Library for calculating ROC curves
library(e1071)      # Library for Random Forest Classifier
data(iris)          # Loading iris dataset
``` 

## Step 2: Data Preprocessing
We need to preprocess the data by handling missing values, removing unnecessary columns, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing or normalizing the data. Some pre-processing steps typically used in logistic regression include:

**Missing Value Imputation:** This step involves replacing missing values with appropriate replacement values such as median, mode, mean, or another relevant statistical metric.

**Feature Scaling / Standardization**: This step involves rescaling the data to have zero mean and unit variance, or to have values within a specified range such as [0,1]. Standardization is preferred since it prevents outliers from dominating the scale of the features.

**Handling Categorical Variables:** This step involves converting qualitative variables into numeric variables or dummy variables. Dummy variables are created for each unique level of the factor variable.

After completing these steps, we should end up with a cleaned and processed dataset that contains only the required features and is ready for modeling. Here is an example code snippet for doing data preprocessing in R using the `caret` package:

```R
# Data preprocessing step
library(caret)  
# Remove irrelevant columns and encode categorical variables
iris_pp <- iris[, -5]
iris_pp$Species <- factor(iris_pp$Species, levels = c("setosa", "versicolor", "virginica"),
                          labels = c(1, 2, 3))
# Split data into train and test sets
set.seed(123)
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(iris$Species, p=0.8, list = FALSE)
train_pp <- iris_pp[trainIndex, ]
test_pp <- iris_pp[-trainIndex, ]
# Train model
model_fit <- glm(Species ~., family="binomial", data=train_pp)
``` 

Here, we first removed the petal width column from the original dataset, encoded the species column using dummy variables, split the data into train and test sets, and trained a binomial logistic regression model using the `glm()` function from the `stats` package. Note that here, we did not specify any formula because the relationship between features and the target variable is already captured in the dataset. However, if we had additional covariates that were important for predicting the outcome, we could include them in the formula to improve the model performance.

## Step 3: Feature Selection
Once we have prepared the data, the next step is to select the most informative features for modeling. Various techniques such as filter, wrapper, and embedded methods can be used for feature selection.

### Filter Method
Filter method selects the best subset of variables by testing the importance of each variable individually against the response variable using a variety of statistical tests such as Pearson correlation, mutual information, chi-squared, or ANOVA. By selecting the top K variables based on their significance scores, we get rid of those unimportant ones and keep only the important ones. The downside of this approach is that it is computationally intensive and prone to overfitting.

Here is an example code snippet for applying the filter method in R using the `glmnet` package:

```R
# Feature selection step using filter method
library(glmnet)
cvFit <- cv.glmnet(train_pp[, -5], train_pp$Species, alpha = 0)
variableIndices <- which(coef(cvFit, s = "lambda.min")!= 0)
selectedFeatures <- names(train_pp)[variableIndices]
summary(lm(Species ~., data = train_pp[, selectedFeatures]))
``` 

Here, we applied the `cv.glmnet()` function to select the best subset of variables using cross-validation. Then, we extracted the indices of the selected features and used them to generate a summary table of the coefficients of the logistic regression model with only those selected features. 

### Wrapper Method
Wrapper method works similarly to the filter method, except instead of selecting the top K variables based on their importance score, it iteratively adds variables to the model until no significant improvements are seen in the model performance.

Here is an example code snippet for applying the wrapper method in R using the `glmnet` package:

```R
# Feature selection step using wrapper method
library(glmnet)
cvFit <- cv.glmnet(train_pp[, -5], train_pp$Species, alpha = 0)
alphaSeq <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 100)
coefMat <- matrix(nrow = ncol(train_pp)-1, ncol = length(alphaSeq))
for (i in 2:(length(train_pp)-1)){
  for (j in 1:length(alphaSeq)){
    cvFit <- cv.glmnet(train_pp[, -5][,-i], train_pp$Species, alpha = alphaSeq[j])
    coefMat[i, j] <- cvFit$cvm[which.max(cvFit$cvm)]
  }
}
variableIndices <- (coefMat == apply(coefMat, 2, min))[2:dim(coefMat)[1]]
selectedFeatures <- names(train_pp)[variableIndices+1]
summary(lm(Species ~., data = train_pp[, selectedFeatures]))
``` 

Here, we again applied the `cv.glmnet()` function to select the best subset of variables using cross-validation. Then, we generated a grid of alphas ranging from 0 to 1 and computed the coefficients of the logistic regression model for each combination of remaining variables and alphas. Next, we found the index of the smallest absolute coefficient value and took the previous index as the optimal number of features. Finally, we used that index plus one as the starting point of the vector of selected features.

### Embedded Method
Embedded methods combine the strengths of both filter and wrapper methods. Instead of selecting the variables one by one, they jointly optimize a weighted sum of the variables' impact on the response variable, which is equivalent to a constraint programming problem. Common embedded methods include forward stepwise selection, backward elimination, and recursive feature elimination.

Forward stepwise selection starts with adding a single variable to the model and gradually including the rest of the variables until no improvement is seen in the model performance. Backward elimination removes variables one by one starting from the full model and stops when no improvement is seen in the model performance. Recursive feature elimination uses recursion to repeatedly eliminate the least important feature until no improvement is seen in the model performance. All of these methods involve repeated computations of the coefficients of the logistic regression model and require careful tuning of the hyperparameters to obtain good results.

Here is an example code snippet for applying the embedded method called Forward Stepwise Selection in R using the `glmnet` package:

```R
# Feature selection step using embedded method - Forward Stepwise Selection
library(glmnet)
cvFit <- cv.glmnet(train_pp[, -5], train_pp$Species, alpha = 0)
model <- glmnet(train_pp[, -5], train_pp$Species, alpha = 0,
                thresh = 1/(1 + sqrt(log(length(train_pp)))))
path <- coef(summary(model))[, "lambda.min"] >= abs(coef(summary(model)))[, "lambda.1se"]
variableIndices <- which(!is.na(path))
selectedFeatures <- names(train_pp)[variableIndices+1]
summary(lm(Species ~., data = train_pp[, selectedFeatures]))
``` 

Here, we applied the `cv.glmnet()` function to select the best subset of variables using cross-validation. Then, we used the `glmnet()` function with the `thresh` argument to tune the threshold for selecting the next variable. Finally, we extracted the indices of the selected features and used them to generate a summary table of the coefficients of the logistic regression model with only those selected features.
