# 1.背景介绍


Reinforcement learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that learn from interaction with the environment to maximize their rewards or minimize their punishments based on their actions. It is widely used in many fields such as robotics, gaming, finance, healthcare, and so on. A reinforcement learning agent can take multiple actions and receive feedbacks after each action, which indicates how well it performs. Based on this feedback, the agent can then update its strategy and improve itself over time. In recent years, there have been many open source libraries dedicated to reinforcement learning (RL), such as OpenAI Gym, TensorFlow Agents, Ray RLlib, and Dopamine. These libraries provide simple and efficient ways for developers to build deep reinforcement learning agents. 

In this article, we will discuss some popular open-source libraries for reinforcement learning in detail and present them along with their advantages and limitations. We hope our readers will find these libraries useful when building reinforcement learning systems. Additionally, we will also compare and contrast these libraries by discussing pros and cons of various design choices and feature implementations. Finally, we'll share insights about what makes a good library suitable for certain use cases and challenges. This article aims to help developers understand different open-source libraries and choose the best one for their needs.


# 2.Core Concepts and Connections
Before diving into details about specific libraries, let's quickly review the core concepts related to reinforcement learning: 

 - Environment: An environment refers to the outside world where an agent interacts with. It contains information such as the current state, reward function, possible actions, and terminal states. 

 - Agent: An agent is any software system that takes actions in response to perceived observations of the environment and learns through trial and error using feedback received from the environment. There are two main types of agents in reinforcement learning: 
    * **Value-Based** agents predict the expected long term return or value function associated with each state and choose the optimal action accordingly. They use techniques like Q-learning, SARSA, etc., to estimate the quality of different actions at each state and select the action that results in the highest estimated value.
    * **Policy-Based** agents directly learn a policy function mapping state to action, without explicitly estimating the values of states and choosing actions based on those estimates. These policies tend to be more stable and reliable than value-based policies because they don't rely on sample returns for estimation. Policy gradient methods like REINFORCE or PPO are examples of policy-based agents.

  - Reward Function: A reward function specifies the goal or reward for the agent during interaction with the environment. It provides numerical value to the agent based on the outcome of its actions and interactions. The reward function can be designed to be sparse or dense depending on the requirements of the problem being solved. 

  - Action Space: Actions refer to the decisions made by the agent towards taking steps within the environment. Each action has an associated cost or penalty, which influences the agent's decision-making process. For example, if an agent loses a bet, it may decide to stop playing and risk lesser chances of winning back. Therefore, an agent must continuously balance the tradeoff between exploiting knowledge gained from past experiences and exploring new options to reach greater rewards. In other words, the size and complexity of the action space determine the level of exploration required by the agent and therefore its performance.

  
  # 3. Core Algorithm Principles & Steps
   Now let's dive deeper into the core algorithm principles behind most reinforcement learning libraries. As mentioned earlier, there are mainly two categories of agents in reinforcement learning, namely Value-Based and Policy-Based. Let us now briefly discuss the basic principles behind both agents.
 
  ## Value-Based Agents 
   ### Model Approach
  
   Value-based agents use a model to represent the dynamics of the environment and calculate the expected future rewards or value for each state. The simplest form of a model could be a lookup table containing the expected future reward for each state-action pair. However, these models often require large amounts of memory and training data to converge effectively. To address this challenge, researchers often use neural networks to approximate the value function. Neural network-based models can achieve high accuracy and efficiency while requiring fewer resources compared to lookup tables.  
  
  ### Update Rule
   
   One way to update the parameters of the value function is to use TD(0) or Monte Carlo updates. TD(0) calculates the temporal difference between the observed reward and the predicted reward under the current behavior policy, and uses it to update the value function parameters. Similarly, MC updates average the observed rewards obtained during an episode, instead of considering all future rewards.  
   
   Both TD(0) and MC updates require an evaluation policy to select actions during training. During evaluation, the agent should act greedily according to the learned value function rather than following the original behavior policy. If no evaluation policy is available, a random policy might work well enough.   
   
   ### Exploration Strategy
   
   Another important aspect of Value-Based agents is exploration. Without proper exploration, the agent would not have sufficient experience to make accurate predictions and would get trapped in local optima. Exploration strategies include epsilon-greedy, softmax, boltzmann exploration, and Gaussian noise. Epsilon-greedy is typically used to explore randomly for a small percentage of timesteps and follow the learned policy otherwise. Softmax exploration allows the agent to explore around the known optimal points, encouraging it to try out new ideas before committing fully to the current solution. Boltzmann exploration produces a probability distribution over actions and biases the agent towards selecting actions that lead to higher reward.   
   
   
   
  ## Policy-Based Agents 
  ### Planning Approach
  
  Policy-based agents directly learn a stochastic policy function mapping state to action, without explicitly estimating the values of states and choosing actions based on those estimates. These policies are generally simpler and easier to optimize compared to value functions. Instead of relying on sample returns for updating the policy parameters, policy-based agents use generalized advantage estimates (GAE) to estimate the advantages over multiple steps. This technique is similar to TD(0) but works better with larger discount factors.  
 
  ### Optimization Technique
  
  Policy-based agents usually use gradient descent optimization algorithms to train their policies. These algorithms update the policy parameters iteratively until convergence, adjusting the step size adaptively to avoid oscillations. Some common optimization techniques include Adam, RMSProp, and AdaGrad.    
  
  ### Exploration Strategy
  
  Policy-based agents are highly sensitive to the choice of exploration strategy. Random exploration plays an essential role in finding regions of unexplored action space, enabling the agent to escape local minima. Boltzmann exploration generates a probability distribution over actions, allowing the agent to focus on promising areas of the action space even if they haven't been visited frequently. Epsilon-greedy exploration selects actions randomly with low probability and follows the learned policy otherwise. 
    
   
  # 4. Specific Code Examples
   Within each category, several reinforcement learning libraries exist, each with its own unique features and strengths. Here, we will highlight some representative code examples from selected libraries to showcase their functionality and ease of implementation. We will cover Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Actor Critic Methods (A2C). 
   
   #### DQN - Deep Q Network
   
   ##### Introduction
   
   DQN stands for Deep Q Networks and is a classic model-free reinforcement learning algorithm proposed by DeepMind. It applies convolutional neural networks to the input image stream to extract meaningful features from raw pixels. Then, it uses a deep neural network to estimate the Q-value function based on the extracted features. It combines off-policy sampling and replay buffer for learning efficiently and enables fast training times.

   #### PPO - Proximal Policy Optimization
   
   ##### Introduction
   
   PPO is a variant of TRPO that improves upon TRPO's stability by adding KL regularization to encourage exploration. It can handle high dimensional spaces since it utilizes neural networks for approximating the policy function and constrains the search space to be smaller than full grid search.

   #### A2C - Advantage Actor-Critic Methods
   
   ##### Introduction
   
   A2C belongs to a family of actor-critic algorithms that uses two separate networks to estimate the policy and value functions. It addresses the central challenges in reinforcement learning: value approximation and bias accumulation due to correlated samples, resulting in high variance gradients.

   # Summary
    
   Comparing the three chosen reinforcement learning libraries, we can see that DQN is the most versatile among them. Its simplicity and effectiveness result in relatively fast training speed, making it easy to apply across different domains. On the other hand, A2C requires careful hyperparameter tuning and expertise in neural network architecture selection, making it more suitable for problems that demand extremely complex solutions. PPO offers significant benefits over TRPO by incorporating exploration strategies and encourages exploration early in the training process, leading to faster and more robust convergence. Overall, the best library depends on the specific requirements of the project and the desired degree of flexibility.
