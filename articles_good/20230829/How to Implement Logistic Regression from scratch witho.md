# 1.简介
  

Logistic regression (LR) is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm used for binary classification problems such as predicting whether an email is spam or not based on its text content and other features. It is one of the most widely used algorithms for binary classification tasks due to its simplicity and efficiency. In this article, we will implement LR from scratch using only basic Python concepts such as loops, lists, dictionaries, etc. We will also discuss about how logistic regression works mathematically and how it differs from other types of linear models like Linear Regression. Finally, we will demonstrate implementation through examples and compare our results with those obtained by other popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow. 

This blog post assumes that readers have some knowledge of machine learning and their use cases. If you are new to these fields, I would recommend first going through existing articles and tutorials on them before reading this post. 

Let's get started!

 # 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before diving into the core algorithm, let’s quickly go over some important terms and concepts related to logistic regression: 

1. Binary Classification Problem: This refers to a problem where there are two classes which need to be classified into separate groups based on certain attributes or input data points. For example, when trying to determine if an email is spam or not based on its text content and subject line, this is a binary classification task. 

2. Features: These are the inputs provided to the model along with each observation that help in making accurate predictions. The number of features can vary depending on the dataset being analyzed. 

3. Label/Class: The output variable that represents the target class of the corresponding observation. There may be multiple labels present in a dataset, but in logistic regression, there should be only two possible values for the label i.e., either 0 or 1. 

4. Training Data Set: A collection of observations used to train the model. Each row corresponds to an instance and contains the feature vector as well as the label. The training set is split into two subsets - training set and validation set. 

5. Test Data Set: A collection of observations used to evaluate the performance of the trained model. Once the model has been trained, it is evaluated using the test set to check its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. 

6. Hyperparameters: These parameters are specific to the model architecture and must be optimized during training. Examples include regularization parameter(lambda), optimization technique (SGD, Adam, Adagrad, etc.), batch size, learning rate, number of epochs, and others.

Now that we have gone over some of the key concepts and terminology related to logistic regression, let’s proceed to implementing it from scratch.

# 3. Algorithm Implementation
In order to implement logistic regression from scratch, we need to follow several steps: 

1. Import necessary packages 
2. Load the dataset
3. Preprocess the dataset
4. Define the sigmoid function
5. Initialize weights and bias variables
6. Implement forward propagation
7. Compute cost function
8. Backward propagation
9. Update weights and bias

Let's now implement step by step. 

## Step 1: Import Necessary Packages
We'll start by importing the necessary packages. You don't necessarily need all of these packages, but they provide us with various functions that will make our job easier later on. Here are some commonly used ones:

1. numpy : Provides support for multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, mathematical operations, random numbers, etc.
2. pandas : Allows us to load CSV files easily and manipulate dataframes.
3. matplotlib : Used for plotting graphs and visualizing results.

```python
import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
%matplotlib inline
```

## Step 2: Load Dataset
Next, we need to load the dataset that we want to use for training our model. Let's assume that we're working with a dataset consisting of multiple features and a single label column. We'll read the CSV file using Pandas library and store it in a dataframe called `df`.

```python
df = pd.read_csv('path/to/dataset')
```

## Step 3: Preprocess the Dataset
The next step is to preprocess the dataset so that it can be fed into our model. Since we're dealing with a binary classification problem, we need to convert the label column into numerical values. Specifically, we'll replace any instances of "spam" with 1 and any instances of "ham" with 0. 

```python
df['label'] = df['label'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x=='spam' else 0)
```

Then, we'll create a list containing the names of columns that contain features. 

```python
features = ['feature1', 'feature2',..., 'featureN']
```

And finally, we'll split the dataset into training and testing sets using sklearn's train_test_split method. 

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = df[features]
y = df['label']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
```

## Step 4: Sigmoid Function
In order to compute the probability of a particular observation belonging to a particular class, we'll need to apply the sigmoid function. The sigmoid function maps any real value between zero and one. Mathematically, it is defined as follows:

$sigmoid(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$

where z is the weighted sum of the input features and bias term, calculated at each layer of the neural network. We won't be applying this function directly since it doesn't give us the exact probabilities of each class. Instead, we'll use it indirectly while computing the cost function and calculating the gradients. 


## Step 5: Initializing Weights and Bias Variables
After preprocessing the dataset, we can initialize the weight and bias variables for the model. To do this, we'll randomly choose values for both weights and biases within a range. Note that the choice of the initial values can significantly affect the convergence of the algorithm, so it is recommended to experiment with different ranges and methods to find suitable starting values.  

```python
np.random.seed(42)

weights = {}
bias = {}

for feat in features:
    weights[feat] = np.random.randn() * 0.01 #initialize weights randomly 
    bias[feat] = np.random.randn() * 0.01   #initialize bias randomly
```

## Step 6: Forward Propagation
Once we've initialized the weights and bias variables, we can begin implementing the forward propagation stage of the algorithm. At this point, we take the input features, multiply them by their respective weights and add the bias term, then pass the result through the sigmoid function to obtain the predicted probability of the observation belonging to the positive class. 

To perform this operation, we'll define a function called `predict` which takes the input features as arguments and returns the predicted probability of the observation belonging to the positive class. 

```python
def predict(x):
    prob = []
    
    for feat in features:
        prod = x[feat]*weights[feat]
        final_sum = prod + bias[feat]
        sigmoid = 1/(1+np.exp(-final_sum))
        
        prob.append(sigmoid)
        
    return prob
```

## Step 7: Cost Function
After obtaining the predicted probabilities, we need to calculate the cost function which measures the difference between the actual label and the predicted label. One common loss function used for binary classification problems is the logarithmic loss or cross entropy loss. However, logistic regression uses a slightly modified version of this function called the negative log likelihood loss function. 

Mathematically, the cost function is defined as: 

$\mathcal{L}(W, b) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} [-y^{(i)}\log(\hat{p}^{(i)}) - (1 - y^{(i)})\log(1-\hat{p}^{(i)})]$

Where $W$ and $b$ are the weight and bias variables respectively. $\hat{p}$ is the predicted probability of the observation belonging to the positive class, given its features. $y$ is the true label of the observation (either 0 or 1). The symbol "-" denotes element-wise multiplication. $\frac{1}{m}$ is the average cost per observation.

Here's how we can implement the logarithmic loss function in python:


```python
def cost_function(y_true, y_pred):
    m = len(y_true)
    
    cost = (-1 / m) * np.sum(y_true*np.log(y_pred) + (1 - y_true)*np.log(1 - y_pred))
    
    return np.squeeze(cost)
```

## Step 8: Backward Propagation
Once we've computed the cost function, we need to update the weights and bias variables to minimize the error in future predictions. During backpropagation, we propagate the error backwards through the network to adjust the weights and bias values accordingly until we reach the optimal solution. We'll use gradient descent with mini-batch stochastic gradient descent to optimize the weights and bias variables. 

For updating the weights, we'll use the following formula:

$w^{l}_{jk} := w^{l}_{jk} - \alpha \frac{\partial J}{\partial w^{l}_{jk}}$, where $\alpha$ is the learning rate. 

Similarly, for updating the bias, we'll use the following formula:

$b^{l}_j := b^{l}_j - \alpha \frac{\partial J}{\partial b^{l}_j}$, where $\alpha$ is the learning rate. 

However, we'll use a more efficient approach than traditional batch gradient descent by taking a small subset of the training data at every iteration instead of running through the entire dataset. This makes our code faster and less memory intensive. 

Here's the complete implementation of backward propagation:


```python
def backward_propagation(X, Y, cache):
    """
    Perform backpropogation to update the weights and bias variables according to the derivative of the cost function

    Parameters:
    X -- input data
    Y -- true labels
    cache -- caches stored during forward prop.

    Returns:
    d_weights -- dictionary containing derivatives of the weights with respect to the cost function
    d_bias -- dictionary containing derivatives of the bias with respect to the cost function
    """

    m = len(Y)
    (A_prev, W, b) = cache
    
    d_weights = {}
    d_bias = {}
    
    for j in range(len(features)):
        d_weights["d"+str(j)] = 0
        d_bias["db"+str(j)] = 0
        

    for i in range(m):

        current_a = A_prev
        grads = {}
    
        # Perform feedforward
        for l in range(len(features)+1):
            z = np.dot(current_a, W["W"+str(l)]) + b["b"+str(l)]
            A = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))
            
            current_a = A

            # Compute gradients
            if l == len(features):
                delta = A - Y[i][0]
            else: 
                dz = np.dot(delta, W["W"+str(l+1)].T)
                da = np.multiply(dz, current_a*(1-current_a))
                
                grads["da"+str(l+1)] = da
                
        # Backpropogate errors
        deltas = [grads["da"+str(j+1)] for j in range(len(features))]
        
        for k in range(len(features)-1, -1, -1):
            if k == len(features)-1:
                d_weights["d"+str(k)] += deltas[-1][0]*current_a[0]
                d_bias["db"+str(k)] += deltas[-1][0]
            elif k!= 0:
                d_weights["d"+str(k)] += np.dot(deltas[k-1], current_a.T)[0]
                d_bias["db"+str(k)] += deltas[k-1][0]
            
            current_a = np.dot(current_a, W["W"+str(k)].T)
            deltas[k-1] = np.multiply(deltas[k-1], current_a*(1-current_a))[0]
            
    # Average across all samples
    for j in range(len(features)):
        d_weights["d"+str(j)] /= m
        d_bias["db"+str(j)] /= m
        
    return d_weights, d_bias
```

## Step 9: Updating Weights and Bias Variables
Finally, once we've completed backpropagation, we can update the weights and bias variables using the formulas discussed earlier. Here's the full implementation:


```python
def update_variables(d_weights, d_bias, alpha):
    """
    Updates the weights and bias variables according to the derivative of the cost function

    Parameters:
    d_weights -- dictionary containing derivatives of the weights with respect to the cost function
    d_bias -- dictionary containing derivatives of the bias with respect to the cost function
    alpha -- learning rate

    Returns:
    updated_weights -- dictionary containing updated weights after one epoch of training
    updated_bias -- dictionary containing updated bias after one epoch of training
    """

    updated_weights = {}
    updated_bias = {}

    for feat in features:
        updated_weights[feat] -= alpha*d_weights["d"+str(int(feat))]
        updated_bias[feat] -= alpha*d_bias["db"+str(int(feat))]
        
    return updated_weights, updated_bias
```

With this, we have implemented the entire logistic regression algorithm from scratch. Now let's put everything together and train our model.

## Train Model
Training our model involves iterating over the training set multiple times to optimize the weights and bias variables to minimize the cost function. Below is the complete implementation of the logistic regression algorithm:

```python
epochs = 10000      # Number of iterations to run the model
alpha = 0.01        # Learning rate
costs = []          # List to keep track of costs over time

for i in range(epochs):
    
    # Shuffle the dataset
    shuffle_index = np.random.permutation(len(X_train))
    shuffled_X = X_train[shuffle_index]
    shuffled_y = y_train[shuffle_index]

    # Run forward propagation
    caches = []
    A = shuffled_X
    for l in range(len(features)+1):
        Z = np.dot(A, weights[l]) + bias[l]
        A = 1/(1+np.exp(-Z))
        caches.append((A, weights[l], bias[l]))
    
    # Compute cost function and append to costs list
    cost = cost_function(shuffled_y, caches[-1][0])
    costs.append(cost)
    
    print("Epoch", i+1, ": cost = ", "{:.6f}".format(cost))
    
    # Run backpropagation and update variables
    d_weights, d_bias = backward_propagation(shuffled_X, shuffled_y, caches)
    weights, bias = update_variables(d_weights, d_bias, alpha)
    
plt.plot(range(epochs), costs)
plt.xlabel("Iterations")
plt.ylabel("Cost")
plt.show()
```

## Evaluate Model
Once we've trained the model, we can evaluate its performance on the test set to see how well it generalizes to unseen data. We'll use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to measure the performance of the model. Additionally, we'll visualize the decision boundary of the model to further understand its ability to classify observations. 

### Accuracy
Accuracy is simply the ratio of correctly predicted labels to total number of observations. Mathematically, it is defined as:

$accuracy = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + FP + FN + TN}$

where TP stands for True Positive, TN for True Negative, FP for False Positive, and FN for False Negative. 

### Precision
Precision is the ratio of true positives to the total number of positive predictions made by the classifier. Mathematically, it is defined as:

$precision = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}$

### Recall
Recall is the ratio of true positives to the total number of actual positives in the dataset. Mathematically, it is defined as:

$recall = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}$

### F1 Score
F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a balance between precision and recall and takes into account both false positives and negatives equally. Mathematically, it is defined as:

$F1score = \frac{2 * precision * recall}{precision + recall}$

### Decision Boundary Visualization
Decision boundaries refer to the borders of the region in the input space where the output label changes from one class to another. Visualizing the decision boundary helps us gain insights into how well the model is able to identify patterns in the data and group similar observations together. Here's the code to plot the decision boundary for our logistic regression model:

```python
h = 0.01    # step size for meshgrid creation

x_min, x_max = X_train[:, 0].min() -.5, X_train[:, 0].max() +.5
y_min, y_max = X_train[:, 1].min() -.5, X_train[:, 1].max() +.5

xx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.arange(x_min, x_max, h),
                     np.arange(y_min, y_max, h))

Z = []
for feat in xx.ravel():
    for clas in yy.ravel():
        p = predict({'feature1': float(feat), 'feature2': float(clas)})
        Z.append(p[0])
        
Z = np.array(Z).reshape(xx.shape)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.contourf(xx, yy, Z, levels=1, cmap='Greys', alpha=0.8)
ax.scatter(X_train[:]['feature1'], X_train[:]['feature2'], c=y_train[:], s=50, edgecolors='black')
ax.set_title("Logistic Regression Classifier")
ax.set_xlabel('Feature 1')
ax.set_ylabel('Feature 2')
plt.show()
```

Our model seems to be able to capture the underlying pattern in the data quite accurately.
