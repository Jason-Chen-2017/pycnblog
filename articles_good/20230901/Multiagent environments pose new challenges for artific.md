Background
Multi-agent systems (MAS) have been widely adopted as a popular approach for designing complex automated decision-making processes that require multiple agents interacting with each other over time. MAS are becoming increasingly important due to their ability to handle various real-world problems such as coordination among autonomous vehicles, shared resources, or cooperative robotics tasks. However, the development of efficient multi-agent solutions has also raised significant challenges for AI researchers working on these problems, especially when dealing with complex social interactions between different agents. 

Recent advancements in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques have made it possible for several research teams to develop scalable and effective solutions that can effectively learn policies in large-scale multi-agent environments. Nevertheless, there still exists a lack of understanding about how existing DRL methods address some fundamental issues in multi-agent systems, particularly those related to communication and coordination. In order to make progress towards developing more reliable and effective solutions, it is crucial to better understand the inner workings of multi-agent systems and its underlying principles. To address this gap, we need to develop a deeper understanding of both basic concepts and advanced topics in multi-agent systems, including cooperation, decentralization, consistency, adversarial games, etc., and study how they interact with deep reinforcement learning algorithms. By analysing and comparing the properties and mechanisms involved in multi-agent systems, we can identify gaps in our current knowledge and propose strategies to bridge the existing gap by introducing novel techniques into the DRL framework. With the help of insights from this analysis, we can create new models, architectures, and algorithms that can effectively solve complex multi-agent problems. 

In summary, while traditional single-agent reinforcement learning has served us well for many years, multi-agent reinforcement learning remains an active area of research due to its inherent complexity. This article reviews recent advances in DRL techniques and identifies critical gaps in multi-agent systems and their interaction with DRL algorithms. We then present a taxonomy of relevant concepts, discuss their interdependence within MAS and establish guidelines for algorithmic development in multi-agent environments. Finally, we provide actionable recommendations for future research on addressing the remaining gaps and creating new approaches for tackling multi-agent reinforcement learning.

# 2.Basic Concepts & Terminology
This section provides a brief overview of common terms used in multi-agent systems (MAS). These include:

1. Agent - A participant in a multi-agent system that may act autonomously or collaboratively.
2. Interaction Space - The set of all possible actions and observations that each agent can receive and produce at any given point in time.
3. Communication Channel - An abstract channel through which agents can communicate with one another. There are two types of channels: direct and indirect. Direct communications occur when two agents directly interact via an informal language, such as text messages or spoken words; whereas indirect communications involve passing information alongside signals or data without explicitly revealing the actual content. 
4. Reward Function - A mapping between the joint actions of multiple agents and the corresponding reward signal. It determines what benefits each agent receives from the environment based on its actions.
5. Policy - A function that maps from an observation to an action. Each agent selects an action based on its perceived environment, its internal states, and the joint policy of other agents.
6. Dynamics - The model describing the relationship between the joint actions and subsequent states of multiple agents, usually represented using Markov Decision Process (MDP) formalism.
7. Environment - The physical or virtual space where the agent(s) exist and interact with one another.

The figure below shows an example of a two-agent interaction space:


Each agent's individual policies, beliefs, and motivations define their respective action spaces, observation spaces, and dynamics. Agents must be able to communicate with one another so that they can share relevant information and coordinate their actions. Decentralized control methods are often employed to ensure that agents do not become entangled or rely too heavily on external information sources. 

Centralized control methods offer greater flexibility than decentralized ones but can lead to conflicts if agents disagree about the optimal strategy. As shown earlier, coordination among agents requires special attention during training because they may operate asynchronously and synchronous communication protocols need to be designed accordingly. Consistency constraints can be imposed on agents' actions to prevent unintended consequences. Adversarial games are scenarios where multiple agents compete against each other to achieve a certain goal while minimizing the overall loss. They can provide interesting insights into human-like behavior and emergent capabilities of AI agents.

# 3.Core Algorithms and Techniques for Solving MAS Problems
A core challenge in solving multi-agent systems is deciding how to distribute computational resources across agents to maximize their collective performance. Traditional single-agent optimization methods like Q-learning cannot be applied to situations where multiple agents are simultaneously interacting with each other. Instead, several distributed algorithms such as decentralized policy gradients (DPG), centralized critic (CC), and proximal policy optimization (PPO) have been developed to balance exploration and exploitation during training. The best performing algorithm depends on the specific settings and requirements of the problem being solved.

Another issue in multi-agent systems is ensuring consistent and accurate coordination among agents, i.e., sharing information efficiently and ensuring coherence between their decisions. Synchronous communication protocols allow agents to exchange state updates and select actions simultaneously, but slow down training considerably. Parallel communication schemes enable faster exchange of information but increase communication overhead and potential conflict arising from delay. Distributed Q-learning and model-based RL techniques use decentralized architecture and asynchronous communication to achieve high sample efficiency. Coordinated exploration methods such as population-based training (PBT) attempt to balance exploration and exploitation by adjusting hyperparameters dynamically.

Furthermore, it is essential to study the effects of limited communication bandwidth and computation power on agent performance. Resource allocation algorithms such as resource allocation with rigorous network connectivity (RANC) allocate available computing resources proportionally according to the importance of agents' interactions with others. Proximal policy optimization and concurrent actor-critic (CACS) methods mitigate the impact of slowdown caused by communication latency. One way to improve sample efficiency is to use learned policies instead of ground truth values. Deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (D3RL) uses deep neural networks to learn policies that map from a sequence of observations to actions. Self-supervised learning algorithms can leverage additional unstructured input features to improve exploration. In summary, there is no single solution that works optimally in every situation, and we need to carefully combine different techniques to achieve the desired result.

The above code demonstrates how to train a multi-agent PPO agent in the MiniGrid environment using PyTorch library. The main components of the code are: 

1. `ActorCritic` class - A container of actor and critic networks that takes in image observations and produces action distributions and state values respectively.
2. `Buffer` class - A FIFO queue to store experiences collected during training episodes.
3. `ppo_iter` generator function - Generates batches of experiences for updating parameters of actor and critic networks.
4. `update` function - Updates the parameter of actor and critic networks using the experience collected from previous steps.

Note that the code assumes that each agent interacts with the same environment instance. Also note that since GPU acceleration is required for accelerating the training process, CUDA devices are assumed to be available.
