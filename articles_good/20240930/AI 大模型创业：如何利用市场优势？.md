### 4.2 Loss Functions

Loss functions are metrics that measure the difference between the predicted output of the model and the actual output. Common loss functions include Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cross-Entropy.

$$
MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
$$

$$

Optimization algorithms are used to optimize model parameters by minimizing the loss function. Common optimization algorithms include Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

$$
\theta_{t+1} = \theta_{t} - \alpha \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta)
$$

### 4.4 Regularization Methods

$$

### 4.5 Example: Text Classification with TensorFlow

Consider a text classification problem where the input is text data and the output is the text category. We can use Cross-Entropy as the loss function, Gradient Descent as the optimization algorithm, and L2 regularization as the regularization method.

```python

from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

# Data preprocessing
max_sequence_length = 100
vocab_size = 10000
embedding_dim = 16

# Model architecture
model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=max_sequence_length))
model.add(LSTM(128))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
