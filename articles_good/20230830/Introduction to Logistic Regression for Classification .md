Logistic regression is a popular statistical method used in classification problems with binary outcome variables such as true/false, pass/fail or spam/ham. It belongs to the family of linear models where the dependent variable (target) can be classified into two groups only. The aim of logistic regression is to find the best fitting line that separates the data points based on their input features. In this article, we will go through an example problem using logistic regression for classification and interpret its coefficients and model evaluation metrics. We will also discuss feature selection techniques and apply them to our example problem.<|im_sep|>

- Target variable: The variable we want to predict. For instance, if we are trying to predict whether a student will pass or fail a test, it would be the target variable. 
- Independent variable(s): These variables act as inputs that influence the outcome of the target variable. They could be numerical values such as grades, age, salary, etc., or categorical values such as gender, ethnicity, level of education, etc. 
- Binary classification: This type of prediction involves dividing the population into two categories - typically "true" or "false", "pass" or "fail", or "spam" or "ham". 
- Bernoulli distribution: A probability distribution used in logistic regression. It represents the probability of a given event occurring independently of all other possible events. 

3.核心算法原理
The fundamental idea behind logistic regression is to use a sigmoid function as the activation function for a binary classifier. The sigmoid function maps any real number value to a value between 0 and 1 which can represent the likelihood of an event occurring. Here's how it works:

1. Initialize weights vector w to zeros. 
2. For each training sample x[i], compute y[i] = sigmoid(w^T * x[i]) 
3. Update weights vector by minimizing the cost function J = sum((y[i]-t[i])^2), where t[i] is the true label for sample i. 

Here, y[i] refers to the predicted probability of the positive class for sample i. To make predictions, we simply choose y[i] > 0.5 as the final output.

To train the logistic regression model, we minimize the loss function over all the training samples until the optimal solution is reached. There are different algorithms available for training logistic regression models including gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, Newton’s method, L-BFGS, etc. However, here we will focus on explaining logistic regression from scratch without going into too much detail about these optimization methods.

4.代码实例
We now move towards applying logistic regression to a simple binary classification problem where we try to classify an email as either spam or not spam. Our dataset contains emails along with their labels indicating whether they are spam or not. We start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset.

``` python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, precision_score, recall_score

data = pd.read_csv('spam_dataset.csv')
X = data['text']
y = data['label']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

Next, we create an instance of the LogisticRegression() class and fit the model to the training data.

```python
lr = LogisticRegression()
lr.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

After training the model, we can evaluate its performance on the testing set using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

```python
y_pred = lr.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
f1 = 2*(precision*recall)/(precision+recall)

print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Precision:", precision)
print("Recall:", recall)
print("F1 Score:", f1)
```

In addition to evaluating the model on metrics like accuracy, we can also visualize the model's decision boundary using contour plots or ROC curves. Contour plots show the decision boundary at different values of the threshold parameter while ROC curves plot the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity.

Let's plot the decision boundary and calculate some ROC curve statistics.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, auc

fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_test, y_pred)
roc_auc = auc(fpr, tpr)

plt.figure()
lw = 2
plt.plot(fpr, tpr, color='darkorange',
         lw=lw, label='ROC curve (area = %0.2f)' % roc_auc)
plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color='navy', lw=lw, linestyle='--')
plt.xlim([0.0, 1.0])
plt.ylim([0.0, 1.05])
plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')
plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')
plt.title('Receiver Operating Characteristic')
plt.legend(loc="lower right")
plt.show()
```

Now let's examine the learned coefficients of the logistic regression model and compare them with the weight vectors obtained after running Gradient Descent or Newton’s Method algorithm during training.


```python
coefficients = pd.DataFrame({'feature': list(X.columns), 'weight': np.append(np.array([0]), lr.coef_.flatten())})
print(coefficients)
```

Output:

As expected, the coefficients correspond to the most important features that contribute significantly to determining whether an email is spam or not.
