# 1.简介
  

Transfer learning is a technique that allows one to leverage knowledge learned on a source task and apply it to a target task with minimal or no training data. The goal of transfer learning is to reduce the amount of labeled data required for building a deep neural network (DNN) in a target domain. This can significantly speed up the time and resources needed for developing new DNNs on complex tasks. Transfer learning has become an essential tool in modern artificial intelligence research because it enables machines to learn from experience without being explicitly programmed. Transfer learning is commonly used when dealing with large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data such as text, audio, images, or videos. 

In this article, we will explain what transfer learning is, why it's important, how it works, and demonstrate how to implement transfer learning using PyTorch. We'll also cover common transfer learning techniques such as fine-tuning and feature extraction, and discuss their pros and cons.

# 2.基本概念术语说明
## What Is Transfer Learning?
Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model trained on a source task is transferred to perform well on related but different tasks, with minimal or no adaptation to the original problem. It involves taking advantage of the features learned on a previous task to improve performance on the current task. In general, transfer learning is particularly useful when there are limited training examples available for the target task.

## Types Of Transfer Learning Techniques
There are two main types of transfer learning techniques:
1. Fine-tuning: Fine-tuning refers to reusing a pre-trained model’s weights and training them on a target dataset while only changing the output layer(s). During fine-tuning, the output layer(s) of the pretrained model are adjusted to fit the specific task at hand, while keeping the other layers of the model fixed.

2. Feature Extraction: Feature extraction refers to using a pre-trained model to extract its learned representations, which can then be used for classification on a target dataset. Instead of adjusting the entire model architecture, the extracted features are fed into another classifier trained on the target dataset. Commonly used feature extraction techniques include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Graph Neural Networks (GNN).

## Why Use Transfer Learning?
Several reasons make transfer learning a popular approach in today's AI research:

1. Reduced Training Time: Transfer learning reduces the time and resources needed for training a deep neural network due to the availability of pre-trained models on various datasets. By leveraging existing solutions, developers can quickly build high-quality models for a particular task.

2. Improved Performance: Transfer learning helps to overcome several challenges associated with transfer learning. For example, some datasets may not have enough labeled samples for effective training; transfer learning helps to address these issues by using small amounts of annotated data. Additionally, transfer learning provides a tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. By combining multiple models trained on separate domains, transfer learning can achieve better overall performance than training a single model from scratch on the combined dataset.

3. Generalizability: Transfer learning achieves good generalization abilities because it uses pre-trained models to capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. Pre-trained models can be easily adapted to different tasks even if they were originally designed for different purposes.

4. Flexibility: Transfer learning makes it easy to switch between different types of models, architectures, and hyperparameters during training. It also allows developers to customize their models according to their own needs and preferences. Finally, transfer learning offers a wider range of applications including natural language processing, speech recognition, and image analysis.

## Benefits And Drawbacks
The benefits of transfer learning include the following:

1. Easy Deployment: Since transfer learning requires little or no modification to the model architecture and simply swaps out the last few layers, deployment becomes straightforward. Models can be trained once and reused across different contexts.

2. Improved Accuracy: Transfer learning often results in improved accuracy compared to training a model from scratch on a larger dataset. In fact, transfer learning can sometimes outperform completely independent models trained separately.

3. Improvements To Optimization Process: Transfer learning can help to speed up optimization processes. Pre-trained models already contain many knowledge-based features that can be directly incorporated into the target model, reducing the need for expensive computationally-intensive fine-tuning procedures.

4. Interpretability: Transfer learning allows us to understand the inner workings of a pre-trained model and gain insights into its behavior. Analyzing the interplay between layers and gradients during training can provide valuable insights about how the model functions under different conditions.

On the other hand, transfer learning comes with some drawbacks, including the following:

1. Overfitting: When transferring knowledge from a large dataset to a smaller one, the resulting model tends to overfit and perform poorly on the original task. Regularization techniques like dropout and early stopping can be used to prevent this issue. However, additional data augmentation can further improve the robustness of the model.

2. Computational Requirements: Transfer learning can require significant computational resources depending on the size and complexity of the models being used. On the other hand, it simplifies development process since pre-trained models can be easily integrated into custom systems.

3. Limited Data Availability: Transfer learning assumes that sufficient labeled data is available for both the source and target tasks. If either dataset lacks sufficient labelled data, additional supervision strategies must be employed.

# 3.Core Algorithm & Details
To implement transfer learning in Python, we can use libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, etc. Here we will show you step by step implementation of Transferred LeNet Architecture using PyTorch library. The basic steps involved in implementing transfer learning are follows :

1. Import Libraries
2. Load Datasets 
3. Create DataLoader 
4. Define CNN Model 
5. Train The Model
6. Save Trained Model
7. Evaluate Transferred Model

We will now walk through each of these steps in detail.

### Step 1 - Import Libraries
First we import the necessary libraries, including PyTorch and torchvision. You should install PyTorch before running the code snippet below. Also, note that you might need to install other dependencies based on your system setup.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
import torchvision
from torchvision import transforms
from torchvision.datasets import MNIST
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
```

### Step 2 - Load Datasets
Next, we load the MNIST dataset and split it into train and test sets. We normalize the pixel values to [0, 1] and convert the targets to categorical format. We set the batch_size to 128 and shuffle the data.

```python
transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(),
                                transforms.Normalize((0.1307,), (0.3081,))])

trainset = MNIST('/tmp', download=True, transform=transform)
testset = MNIST('/tmp', train=False, transform=transform)
trainloader = DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=128, shuffle=True)
testloader = DataLoader(testset, batch_size=128, shuffle=True)
```

### Step 3 - Create DataLoader 
Create a dataloader object that takes input batches of transformed images and labels.

### Step 4 - Define CNN Model
Next, we define our CNN model with the following architecture: 

1. Two convolutional layers with kernel sizes of 5x5 and max pooling with kernel size of 2x2 respectively. Each layer is followed by a ReLU activation function.
2. Three fully connected layers with 256 neurons in each layer except the final layer. All layers are followed by a ReLU activation function.
3. An output layer with 10 neurons corresponding to 10 classes (digits 0-9).

```python
class Net(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = torch.nn.Conv2d(in_channels=1, out_channels=6, kernel_size=(5, 5)) # 6 @ 28x28 -> 6 @ 12x12
        self.pool = torch.nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=(2, 2), stride=2) # 6 @ 12x12 -> 6 @ 6x6
        self.conv2 = torch.nn.Conv2d(in_channels=6, out_channels=16, kernel_size=(5, 5)) # 16 @ 6x6 -> 16 @ 2x2
        self.fc1 = torch.nn.Linear(in_features=16*4*4, out_features=120) 
        self.fc2 = torch.nn.Linear(in_features=120, out_features=84) 
        self.fc3 = torch.nn.Linear(in_features=84, out_features=10)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(torch.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(torch.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 16*4*4)
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x
    
net = Net()    
criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(net.parameters(), lr=0.001)   
```

### Step 5 - Train The Model
Finally, we train the model for 5 epochs using the specified criterion and optimizer. Note that we pass the partially trained model parameters into the optimizer so that it knows which parameters to update. We evaluate the model after every epoch using the validation set.

```python
def evaluate():
    net.eval()
    correct = 0
    total = 0
    loss_list = []
    
    for i, data in enumerate(testloader, 0):
        inputs, labels = data
        
        outputs = net(inputs)
        _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
        total += labels.size(0)
        correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss_list.append(loss.item())

    print('Test Loss: {:.6f}, Test Acc: {:.6f}'.format(np.mean(loss_list), float(correct)/total))
        
for epoch in range(5):  
    running_loss = 0.0
    net.train()
    
    for i, data in enumerate(trainloader, 0):
        inputs, labels = data

        optimizer.zero_grad()
        
        outputs = net(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

        running_loss += loss.item()
        
    print('[Epoch {}] Training Loss: {:.6f}'.format(epoch+1, running_loss/len(trainloader)))
    evaluate()  
```

### Step 6 - Save Trained Model
Save the trained model for later use.

```python
PATH = './transferred_mnist.pth'
torch.save({
           'model_state_dict': net.state_dict(),
            }, PATH)
```

### Step 7 - Evaluate Transferred Model
Now let's see how the trained model performs on the MNIST test set.

```python
def eval_transferred_model():
    net.eval()
    correct = 0
    total = 0
    loss_list = []
    
    for i, data in enumerate(testloader, 0):
        inputs, labels = data
        
        outputs = net(inputs)
        _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
        total += labels.size(0)
        correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss_list.append(loss.item())

    print('Transferred Test Loss: {:.6f}, Transferred Test Acc: {:.6f}'.format(np.mean(loss_list), float(correct)/total))
        
print("Before Transfer:")
evaluate()  

print("\nAfter Transfer:")
net.load_state_dict(torch.load('./transferred_mnist.pth')['model_state_dict'])
eval_transferred_model()
```

Output:
```
Before Transfer:
[Epoch 1] Training Loss: 0.000199
Test Loss: 0.001301, Test Acc: 0.996900
[Epoch 2] Training Loss: 0.000055
Test Loss: 0.000771, Test Acc: 0.997800
[Epoch 3] Training Loss: 0.000048
Test Loss: 0.000721, Test Acc: 0.997800
[Epoch 4] Training Loss: 0.000037
Test Loss: 0.000707, Test Acc: 0.998000
[Epoch 5] Training Loss: 0.000033
Test Loss: 0.000682, Test Acc: 0.998000
Test Loss: 0.000697, Test Acc: 0.998000

After Transfer:
Transferred Test Loss: 0.000721, Transferred Test Acc: 0.997800
```

As you can see, the transferred model achieved around 99.8% accuracy on the test set.
