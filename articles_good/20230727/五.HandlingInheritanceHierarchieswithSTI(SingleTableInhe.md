# 1.简介
         
 Single table inheritance is a technique in object-oriented programming where an entity can be represented as a single row of data in a relational database table, and the relationships between different classes are represented using foreign key constraints. This means that each subclass shares the same table structure as its superclass and all columns defined in the superclass are inherited by the subclasses. 
         In this article we will explain how to implement single table inheritance using SQLAlchemy ORM framework for Python language. 

         # 2.Concepts & Terminologies:

         **Inheritance:** Refers to the concept of creating new classes from existing ones based on their common properties or characteristics. It enables code reuse and reduces complexity while keeping the program modularized.

         **Polymorphism:** The ability of objects of different classes to take on many forms. Polymorphism allows us to write generic functions or methods which work with any instance of a class that inherits from a base class. For example, a list containing instances of various types of animals could have a function that calculates the total weight of those animals without needing to know specifically what type they belong to.

         **Class hierarchy:** A collection of related classes arranged in a tree-like pattern, where one class inherits from another. Each class represents an object or concept and has attributes and behaviors specific to it. The root of the hierarchy is called the "base class" and contains no other parent classes. Leaf nodes represent individual objects or concepts and cannot inherit further.

         **Single table inheritance:** A form of inheritance where each child class is mapped to a separate table, but all tables share the same schema, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of data.

         **Relational database:** A database management system designed to store and organize data in tables with relationships between them.

         **Database schema:** Defines the logical organization of the database, including the names, types, sizes, and formats of the tables, fields, and indexes.

         **Foreign key constraint:** A constraint used to enforce referential integrity between two tables, ensuring that values in one column are unique and match up with corresponding values in the other table's primary key(s).

         **ORM (Object Relational Mapping):** An abstraction layer that maps entities from an object-oriented domain model to a relational database schema.

         **Entity:** A piece of information about someone, place, thing, or event that needs to be stored or managed in a database.

         **Attribute:** A property or characteristic of an entity, such as name, age, gender, address, phone number, etc.

         **Relationship:** A connection between two entities or more than three entities that exists in real life. Examples include ownership, employment, friendship, association, and taxes paid.

         **Mapping:** A process of transforming data from one format to another. Example mappings may include converting CSV files to a SQLite database or JSON documents to XML files.

         **Python programming language:** A high-level interpreted, multi-paradigm programming language used extensively for web development, scientific computing, machine learning, and data analysis.

         **SQLAlchemy library:** A popular open source ORM for Python that provides functionality for handling databases in an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) way.

         **PostgreSQL database:** A powerful open-source database management system known for its performance, scalability, and stability compared to others.

         **SQLite database:** A lightweight embedded database engine that stores data in a single file, making it ideal for small applications or embedded systems.

         **Application Layer:** Layers above the network transport layer, responsible for handling application logic, user interaction, and presentation.

         **Presentation Layer:** The layer responsible for displaying output to users through a variety of devices, such as screens, printers, speakers, and displays.

         **Business Logic Layer:** The layer that performs all business operations, input validation, error handling, and security checks.

         **Data Access Layer:** The layer responsible for interfacing with the underlying database system, executing queries, transactions, and managing concurrency.

         **Network Transport Layer:** The layer responsible for exchanging messages over a communication channel such as a TCP/IP socket or a wireless connection.

         # 3.Technical details and implementation:

        ## Introduction
        To demonstrate single table inheritance using SQLAlchemy ORM framework, let’s consider a simple scenario: We want to create a hierarchical relationship between employees and departments. In this case, an employee belongs only to one department, so there should be a linkage table to establish this relationship. However, instead of creating multiple tables for each entity and maintaining consistency across these tables, we can use a single table for both employees and departments and apply single table inheritance technique to map both entities to the same table.

        ## Defining the Model Classes
        Here is an example of defining the Employee and Department models using SQLAlchemy syntax:

       ```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, ForeignKey, Integer, String, DateTime
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship


Base = declarative_base()


class Department(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'departments'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String(50), nullable=False)
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<Department(id={self.id},name='{self.name}')>"
        
    
class Employee(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'employees'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    first_name = Column(String(50))
    last_name = Column(String(50))
    email = Column(String(100), unique=True, nullable=False)
    birthdate = Column(DateTime)
    department_id = Column(ForeignKey('departments.id'))
    department = relationship("Department", backref="employees")
    
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<Employee(first_name='{self.first_name}',last_name='{self.last_name}',email='{self.email}',birthdate={self.birthdate},department_id={self.department_id})>"
       ```

        ## Applying Single Table Inheritance
        Now that we have defined our model classes, we need to specify the mapping between them. Since we want to use a single table for both employees and departments, we need to define a common base class named BaseModel that defines the common attributes shared by both models:

       ```python
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declared_attr


class BaseModel(object):
    @declared_attr
    def __tablename__(cls):
        return cls.__name__.lower() +'s'
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
   ```

        By default, we set the tablename attribute to lowercase version of the class name followed by “s” (e.g., “employee”, “department”). Next, we add the `id` column as the primary key of each table.

        Finally, we use the `@declared_attr` decorator to generate the `__tablename__` attribute dynamically at runtime. This ensures that if we change the class name later, the generated tablename would also reflect the updated name.

        With the base class defined, we can now extend the Department and Employee classes to inherit from it:

       ```python
import datetime

from. import db


class Department(BaseModel, db.Model):
    name = Column(String(50), nullable=False)
    
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.id}: {self.name}"
        
    def insert(self):
        db.session.add(self)
        db.session.commit()
        
    def delete(self):
        db.session.delete(self)
        db.session.commit()
        
    def update(self, **kwargs):
        for k, v in kwargs.items():
            setattr(self, k, v)
        db.session.commit()
        
    def get_all_employees(self):
        return [emp.serialize for emp in self.employees]

    @property
    def serialize(self):
        """Return object data in easily serializable format"""
        return {'id': self.id,
                'name': self.name}


    @classmethod
    def find_by_id(cls, _id):
        return cls.query.filter_by(id=_id).first()

    @classmethod
    def find_by_name(cls, name):
        return cls.query.filter_by(name=name).first()

class Employee(BaseModel, db.Model):
    first_name = Column(String(50))
    last_name = Column(String(50))
    email = Column(String(100), unique=True, nullable=False)
    birthdate = Column(DateTime)
    department_id = Column(ForeignKey('departments.id'), nullable=False)
    department = relationship("Department", backref="employees")

    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, email, birthdate, department_id):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.email = email
        self.birthdate = birthdate
        self.department_id = department_id

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name}"
        
    def insert(self):
        db.session.add(self)
        db.session.commit()
        
    def delete(self):
        db.session.delete(self)
        db.session.commit()
        
    def update(self, **kwargs):
        for k, v in kwargs.items():
            setattr(self, k, v)
        db.session.commit()
        
    def serialize(self):
        """Return object data in easily serializable format"""
        return {'id': self.id,
                'first_name': self.first_name,
                'last_name': self.last_name,
                'email': self.email,
                'birthdate': str(self.birthdate)}

    @classmethod
    def find_by_id(cls, _id):
        return cls.query.filter_by(id=_id).first()

    @classmethod
    def find_by_email(cls, email):
        return cls.query.filter_by(email=email).first()
       ```

        ## Creating Database Tables and Migrating Changes
        After defining our models, we need to create the required tables in the database. We can do this using the following commands:

       ```python
# Create all tables in the database
db.create_all()

# Drop all tables before creating again
db.drop_all()

# Migrate changes to the database
db.migrate()
       ```

        These commands will create all necessary tables in the database according to the defined models and perform any needed migrations after modifying the model definitions.


        ## Insertion and Retrieval Operations
        Once the tables are created, we can start inserting and retrieving records using SQLAlchemy Query API. Here is an example of adding some sample data to the database:

       ```python
# Insert test data into the database

dept1 = Department('Sales')
dept1.insert()

dept2 = Department('Marketing')
dept2.insert()

emp1 = Employee('John', 'Doe', '<EMAIL>', datetime.datetime(1990, 7, 21), dept1.id)
emp1.insert()

emp2 = Employee('Jane', 'Smith', '<EMAIL>', datetime.datetime(1988, 3, 12), dept2.id)
emp2.insert()
       ```

        To retrieve data from the database, we can use the query method provided by SQLAlchemy to filter and sort records. Here is an example:

       ```python
# Retrieve data from the database

dept1 = Department.find_by_name('Sales')
print(dept1)

emp2 = Employee.find_by_email('<EMAIL>')
print(emp2.serialize())

for emp in dept1.employees:
    print(emp.serialize())
       ```

        These examples show how to interact with the database and manipulate data using SQLAlchemy ORM.
