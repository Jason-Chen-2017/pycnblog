        Rust是一种开源、安全、并发的编程语言。它被设计成一门系统编程语言，支持运行期内存安全和线程安全，提供了保证数据竞争条件下的线程安全机制。

        Rust除了拥有功能强大的标准库外，还提供了类似C++的高性能编程能力，通过move关键字可以防止资源的滥用，保证内存的安全性。

        Rust不但适用于服务器端，也适用于嵌入式、桌面应用程序、命令行工具、网络协议等领域。


        ## 为什么选择Rust？

        ### 更轻量级
        Rust比起其他编程语言更加简洁、简单。Rust的代码编写起来比较易读，编译速度快，同时内存占用小。

        ### 更安全
        Rust具有自动内存管理功能，避免了常见的堆栈溢出和内存泄漏导致的问题。而且Rust还有编译器检查程序逻辑中的错误，避免出现运行期的崩溃或异常，提升了代码质量。

        ### 更有效率
        通过借用检查和生命周期推断，Rust可以让程序员能够在编译时就找到错误，减少运行期的逻辑bug。而且通过迭代器和闭包机制，可以在运行时进行数据处理。

        ### 更可靠
        Rust支持并发编程，可以充分利用多核CPU资源，同时又不会导致数据竞争和死锁问题。而且Rust还提供了运行时的无边界队列，可以让程序员方便地异步通信。

        ## Rustlings - Learn Rust by solving exercises: A fun way to get started with the Rust programming language

       ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607927243689/wMQXjJjqm.png?auto=compress)

        Rustlings is a series of small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code. You'll practice fundamental concepts in Rust as well as gain practical experience with standard library APIs and common tools like cargo and rustc. The exercises are beginner-friendly and include tests that ensure your solutions work correctly.

        This guide will help you understand what Rust is, why it's useful for developers, and how to install and run Rustlings on your computer. We'll also go through an example exercise to see some real-world Rust code and learn about ownership and borrowing in more detail. Finally, we'll discuss potential future directions for this project and talk about how to contribute to the project if you're interested.

        Note: This is not a full course or guide on learning Rust; rather, it provides a hands-on approach to getting started using Rust and testing your knowledge along the way. If you need more in-depth coverage, check out other resources available online. 

        Let's dive into Rust!

        # 2. 基本概念术语说明

        首先，我会介绍一些Rust中的基本概念，包括Ownership（所有权），Borrowing（借用）和Lifetime（生命周期）。

        ### Ownership

        Ownership refers to the primary way memory is allocated and managed in Rust. In other words, when you create a variable in Rust, its value is owned by that specific variable, which means that there can only be one owner at any given time. Once the owner goes out of scope (i.e., the variable falls out of scope), the value is dropped and deallocated automatically. In contrast, in other languages like C++, Java, and Python, variables are often copied instead of moved when assigned to another variable or passed as arguments. 

        There are three types of ownership in Rust:

        1. Borrowed values: These values are references to data owned by someone else but not owned itself. To obtain access to such a reference, we must explicitly specify that we want to borrow the object from that source. When the borrow ends, the original owner continues to own the data until all borrows have been released.

        2. Mutable values: These values allow us to modify the underlying data owned by someone else. They can be modified without affecting the owner’s copy, so multiple owners can share the same mutable data simultaneously. However, because they can change the state of the program at runtime, these kinds of values must be accessed carefully.

        3. Ownerless values: These values do not belong to anyone in particular. They are typically created by function calls or temporary expressions, and their lifetime is tied to the expression that creates them. As soon as the expression that creates them ends, the value is dropped and deallocated. For example, `let x = String::from("hello");` creates a new string and assigns ownership to a new variable named `x`. By default, strings are immutable and can't be modified after creation, so `mut` isn't necessary here.

        ### Borrowing

        Borrowing allows us to temporarily take ownership of a piece of data while still being able to use it. This is achieved by declaring a borrow, which specifies a period of time where we have access to the data without giving up ownership. Attempting to mutate the data outside of the borrow results in a compile error. Borrows can either be exclusive or shared. Exclusive borrows give us complete control over the data during the specified period of time, whereas shared borrows allow us to read the data but not modify it. Here's an example of exclusive borrowing:

        ```rust
        fn main() {
            let mut s = "hello".to_string();

            // Create an exclusive borrow of s
            {
                let b1 = &mut s;
                println!("{}", b1); // prints "hello"

                *b1 = "world"; // attempt to modify s inside the borrow

                println!("{}", b1); // prints "world"
            }

            println!("{}", s); // prints "world"
        }
        ```

        Shared borrows are declared using `&`:

        ```rust
        fn main() {
            let s = "hello world";

            // Create a shared borrow of s
            {
                let b1 = &s;
                println!("{:?}", b1); // prints "&'static str"

                // Attempt to modify s inside the borrow
                // Uncommenting the following line would result in a compile error
                //*b1 = "goodbye world";
            }

            // Drop the last borrow of s here, allowing it to be deallocated
        }
        ```

        Note that even though `s` has a static lifetime (`'static`), it cannot be modified within the shared borrow since it doesn't own the actual data. Instead, a `&str` slice referencing the original string data is returned instead.

        ### Lifetimes

        The concept of lifetimes in Rust refers to the duration of time during which a particular reference is valid. In other words, each borrow has a corresponding lifetime, which determines how long the borrow is valid. This helps prevent runtime errors due to incorrect usage of references. Most of the time, lifetime annotations aren't needed explicitly in Rust, but they can be useful for ensuring type safety and preventing resource leaks. Here's an example:

        ```rust
        struct Person<'a> {
            name: &'a str,
            age: u32,
        }

        impl<'a> Person<'a> {
            pub fn new(name: &'a str, age: u32) -> Self {
                Person {
                    name,
                    age,
                }
            }

            pub fn greet(&self) {
                println!("Hello, my name is {} and I'm {}", self.name, self.age);
            }
        }

        fn main() {
            let person = Person::new("Alice", 25);
            person.greet();

            let name = "Bob";
            let age = 30;
            let ref_person = Person::new(name, age); // Specify lifetime explicitly
            ref_person.greet();
        }
        ```

    # 3. 核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解

     # Basic Types
    Rust is statically typed, meaning that every variable must be annotated with a specific type before it can be assigned a value. There are several basic built-in types in Rust, including integers, floating point numbers, boolean, characters, and tuples. 
    
    Here are some examples:
    
    ```rust
    // Integer type
    let num: i32 = 10;
    
    // Floating point number type
    let decimal: f64 = 3.14159;
    
    // Boolean type
    let is_awesome: bool = true;
    
    // Character type
    let letter: char = 'A';
    
    // Tuple type
    let tup: (i32, f64, bool) = (10, 3.14159, true);
    ```
    
    
    # Variables and Mutability
    
    Rust supports two different kinds of variables: immutable and mutable. Immutable variables cannot be changed once they are set, while mutable variables can be updated later. Here are some examples:
    
    ```rust
    // Declare and initialize an immutable integer variable
    let num: i32 = 10;
    
    // Error! Cannot assign a new value to an immutable variable
    //num = 20;
    
    // Declare and initialize a mutable integer variable
    let mut num: i32 = 10;
    
    // Update the value of the variable
    num = 20;
    ```
    
    Although it may seem like mutation is bad in many ways, Rust offers powerful mechanisms for working with mutable data safely and efficiently. In fact, Rust guarantees that mutations to immutably borrowed data won’t cause undefined behavior – these mutations just produce new values that can be held in separate places in memory. In other words, Rust ensures that the rules of immutability don’t accidentally become broken by accidental mutations.
    
    Rust’s approach to handling mutable data follows a very important principle called ‘the single assignment rule’. It states that once a variable is bound to a particular location in memory, that location can never again hold another value until it is no longer referenced elsewhere in the program. This makes it possible to guarantee safe concurrent operations on mutable data by making sure that no two pointers to the same data exist at the same time.
    
    
     # Functions and Control Flow
    
    In Rust, functions are first class citizens and support both generic parameters and closures. Functions can return multiple values, have optional parameters, and can be defined recursively.
    
    Here are some examples:
    
    ```rust
    // Define a simple function that takes no arguments and returns nothing
    fn say_hello() {
        println!("Hello World!");
    }
    
    // Define a function that takes one argument and returns one value
    fn add_one(n: i32) -> i32 {
        n + 1
    }
    
    // Define a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number
    fn factorial(n: i32) -> i32 {
        match n {
            0 => 1,
            _ => n * factorial(n - 1)
        }
    }
    
    // Call the above functions
    say_hello();     // Output: Hello World!
    assert_eq!(add_one(5), 6);    // Assert equality between expected and actual output
    assert_eq!(factorial(5), 120); 
    ```
    
    Rust supports various forms of control flow structures, including conditionals, loops, and pattern matching.
    
    Conditionals are implemented using if statements and evaluate to a boolean value. Loops iterate over collections or execute a block of code repeatedly based on a loop counter. Pattern matching enables conditional logic based on the shape of data, similar to switch cases in other programming languages. Here are some examples:
    
    ```rust
    // Simple if statement
    if num < 10 {
        println!("Smaller than ten.");
    }
    
    // Else if statement
    if num >= 10 && num <= 20 {
        println!("Between ten and twenty.");
    } else {
        println!("Greater than twenty.");
    }
    
    // Match case statement
    match num {
        0 => println!("Zero"),
        num if num > 0 => println!("Positive"),
        num if num < 0 => println!("Negative")
    };
    
    // Loop over a range of values
    for i in 1..5 {
        print!("{} ", i);
    }
    println!(""); // Print a newline character
    
    // Loop over a collection
    let arr = [1, 2, 3];
    for val in arr.iter() {
        print!("{} ", val);
    }
    println!(""); // Print a newline character
    ```
    
    
    # Structs and Enums
    
    Rust introduces the concept of structs and enums, which represent complex data types composed of fields and variants. Both structs and enums can contain methods and implement traits, enabling higher level abstractions.
    
    Here are some examples:
    
    ```rust
    // Define a struct representing a point in 2D space
    #[derive(Debug)]
    struct Point {
        x: i32,
        y: i32
    }
    
    // Implement a method for the Point struct
    impl Point {
        fn distance(&self, other: &Point) -> f64 {
            let dx = self.x as f64 - other.x as f64;
            let dy = self.y as f64 - other.y as f64;
            
            ((dx * dx) + (dy * dy)).sqrt()
        }
    }
    
    // Define an enum representing a color choice
    enum Color {
        Red,
        Green,
        Blue
    }
    
    // Instantiate an instance of the Color enum
    let c = Color::Green;
    ```
    
    
    # Collections
    
    Rust provides several collections that are optimized for performance and ease of use. Some popular ones include vectors, slices, hash maps, and linked lists. Each of these collections comes with its own characteristics and benefits. Vectors are the most commonly used collection and provide efficient appending, removal, and indexing operations. Slices, unlike traditional arrays, are dynamically sized and can be used anywhere that requires contiguous blocks of memory. Hash maps offer constant time lookups, insertions, and removals compared to sorted arrays, while maintaining fast iteration times. Linked lists enable dynamic addition and removal of elements and can be easily converted back and forth to vector format for more efficient processing.
    
    
    
    # Memory Management
    
    One of the core features of Rust is its automatic memory management system. Unlike garbage collected languages like Java and Golang, Rust uses a combination of ownership and borrowing to manage memory automatically. Rust also supports manual memory allocation and deallocation via the Box and Rc smart pointers, which offer guaranteed release of memory even in the presence of cyclic references. 
    
    Other memory management techniques like reference counting and ARC (automatic reference counting) also play a role in managing memory in Rust, but they come with additional overhead and complexity that Rust tries to eliminate by relying solely on ownership and borrowing.
