         Jersey is an open source lightweight Java RESTful framework that provides a flexible and extensible architecture for developing web applications. It has become very popular due to its ease of use and high performance compared to other Java frameworks like Spring MVC or CXF. In recent years, Jersey has also gained popularity amongst Java developers looking for a more light weight alternative to Spring Framework. 
         
         To add support for JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services) in Spring Boot, we need to configure a few properties and dependencies such as spring-boot-starter-jersey module and jersey-spring3 module along with jersey-container-servlet-core artifact. This can be a time consuming task if you have many endpoints and require customization. 
         The purpose of this article is to provide a step by step guide on how to integrate Jersey into a Spring Boot application using Spring Boot starter Jersey library without any customizations required. We will demonstrate how easy it is to create JAX-RS resource classes, configure Jackson ObjectMapper, enable CORS support and exception handling in a simple Spring Boot app. After reading this article, you should feel confident in creating RESTful services in your Spring Boot application without writing a single line of Jersey configuration code.

         Let's quickly go over some important concepts and terminologies related to Jersey:
         
         
         ## What is REST?
         
         REST stands for Representational State Transfer which is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used when creating web services. Its main idea is that all interactions between client and server are stateless and each request must include all necessary information needed to handle the specific request. REST-based web services typically employ HTTP protocol but can also use HTTPS.
         
         ## What is JAX-RS?
         
         JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services) is a part of Java EE 7 specification that allows us to develop RESTful web services. It was originally based on the JAX-RPC technology but later became standalone with no dependency on XML. It uses annotations to define resources and methods. JAX-RS supports various formats including JSON, XML, plain text and binary data. JAX-RS implementations exist for several servers including Apache Tomcat, GlassFish, Jetty, etc.
         
         ## What is Jersey?
         
         Jersey is an implementation of JAX-RS standard that builds upon the fundamentals established by JAX-RS. Jersey extends the standard functionality by providing additional features such as security, internationalization, performance optimization, media type support, documentation generation, entity providers, and message body readers/writers. Jersey is available under ASL 2.0 license from Oracle Corporation.
         
         ## How does Jersey work internally?
         
         Jersey follows the basic architectural pattern of the JAX-RS specification where there is a container component called Application class that manages lifecycle of all components within the application. Underlying the Application object is the Jersey runtime engine that takes care of processing requests and generating responses. Jersey also comes with a number of extensions that allow us to plug in additional functionality such as interceptors, filters, mappers, exception mappers, message body reader/writer implementations, entity providers, etc.
          
         
         # 3.Spring Boot Integration with Jersey - Steps to Integrate Jersey into Spring Boot
         
         Now let's dive into details on how to get started with integration of Jersey in a Spring Boot application. Before we begin, make sure you have configured your development environment correctly with JDK and Maven installed. If not, please refer to my previous articles on setting up a development environment for Spring Boot development.
         
         
         ## Step 1 : Create a new Spring Boot Project
         
         Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. Type the following command to generate a new Spring Boot project with the name "JerseyDemo" and package name "com.example".
         
        $ mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.springframework.boot -DarchetypeArtifactId=spring-boot-starter-web -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=JerseyDemo -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.example
        
        This will generate a skeleton project structure with pom.xml file at the root level containing all required dependencies. You can now import the project into your IDE of choice.
        
         
         ## Step 2 : Add Dependencies Required for Jersey
         
         Next, we need to add two dependencies in our pom.xml file. One is for Spring Boot starter Jersey while another is for the actual Jersey core library itself.
         
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-jersey</artifactId>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.glassfish.jersey.core</groupId>
            <artifactId>jersey-server</artifactId>
            <version>${jersey.version}</version>
        </dependency>
        <!-- Specify version of Jersey here -->
        <properties>
            <jersey.version>2.29.1</jersey.version>
        </properties>
        
         Here ${jersey.version} property specifies the version of Jersey to be used. For simplicity, I am specifying the latest stable release version. Also note that there are different versions of Jersey depending on what is available in the repositories. Therefore, check your own repository settings before updating the property value.
         
         
         ## Step 3 : Create a Resource Class for Handling Requests
         
         Next, let's create our first resource class to handle incoming requests. Create a new java file named HelloResource inside com.example package and paste the following code snippet into it:
         
        package com.example;

        import javax.ws.rs.*;
        import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

        @Path("/hello")
        public class HelloResource {

            @GET
            @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
            public String sayHello() {
                return "Hello World!";
            }

        }

         Here we have defined a Path "/hello" for this resource class which means it will handle all GET requests made to /hello path. We have also annotated the method sayHello() with @GET annotation which indicates that it handles only GET requests. Additionally, we have provided a @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN) annotation to indicate that this method returns a plain text response. Finally, we have returned a string literal "Hello World!" which will be sent back to the caller as the response payload.
         
         
         ## Step 4 : Configure Jackson ObjectMapper for Serializing Response Objects
         
         By default, Spring Boot autoconfigures Jackson ObjectMapper to serialize objects in JSON format. We don't need to do anything else to start getting serialized responses out of our service. But if we want to customize the serialization behavior, we can register custom serializers or deserializers by extending AbstractJackson2HttpMessageConverter or implementing JacksonJaxbXMLProvider interface.
         
         
         ## Step 5 : Enable Cross Origin Resource Sharing Support
         
         Spring Boot automatically configures support for cross origin resource sharing (CORS). However, if you need to explicitly enable CORS support for certain paths or disable it globally, you can use the appropriate annotations.
         
        // Enable CORS support for particular endpoint
        @CrossOrigin
        @RequestMapping("/api/data")
        public ResponseEntity<String> getData(){
            //...
        }
        
        // Disable CORS support globally
        @Configuration
        @EnableWebMvc
        public class MyCorsConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {
        
            @Override
            public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
                registry.addMapping("/**").allowedOrigins("*");
            }
        
        }
        
         Here, the @CrossOrigin annotation enables CORS support specifically for the endpoint identified by the mapping expression "**/data", while the second example disables CORS support globally for all mappings except the health endpoint "/health". You can modify these expressions accordingly to suit your needs.
         
         
         ## Step 6 : Handle Exception Conditions
         
         Another important aspect of building robust microservices is error handling. Jersey provides built-in support for exception handling through the ExceptionMapper interface which maps exceptions thrown during request processing to proper HTTP response messages. We can implement custom exception mappers for individual exception types or create a general catch-all mapper to handle any uncaught exceptions.
         
        // Custom exception handler for NotFoundException
        @Provider
        public class NotFoundExceptionHandler implements ExceptionMapper<NotFoundException> {
            
            private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(NotFoundExceptionHandler.class);
            
            @Override
            public Response toResponse(NotFoundException e) {
                
                LOGGER.error("Error processing request.", e);
                
                ErrorInfo errorInfo = new ErrorInfo();
                errorInfo.setCode(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND.value());
                errorInfo.setMessage(e.getMessage());
                
                return Response
                       .status(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)
                       .entity(errorInfo)
                       .build();
                
            }
            
        }
        
        // General catch-all exception handler
        @Provider
        public class GeneralExceptionHandler implements ExceptionMapper<Throwable> {
            
            private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(GeneralExceptionHandler.class);
            
            @Override
            public Response toResponse(Throwable t) {
                
                LOGGER.error("Unexpected error occurred.", t);
                
                ErrorInfo errorInfo = new ErrorInfo();
                errorInfo.setCode(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.value());
                errorInfo.setMessage("An unexpected error occurred.");
                
                return Response
                       .status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
                       .entity(errorInfo)
                       .build();
                
            }
            
        }
        
         Here, we created two custom exception handlers for the NotFoundException which throws 404 Not Found status code and for any other exceptions, we throw 500 Internal Server Error status code with a generic error message indicating that an unexpected error occurred. Note that we logged the errors for better debugging purposes.
         
         
         ## Summary
         
         With just a few lines of code, we were able to add support for JAX-RS in our existing Spring Boot application without requiring any customizations. This makes our life easier since we don't need to write any Jersey configuration code. Moreover, Jersey offers numerous advanced features that are beyond the scope of this tutorial and can help improve the overall quality and maintainability of our RESTful APIs.
