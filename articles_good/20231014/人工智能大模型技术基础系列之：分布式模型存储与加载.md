# 1.背景介绍


近年来随着深度学习的火热，基于神经网络的深度学习模型在图像、文本、语音等领域越来越受欢迎。基于大数据处理的分布式计算平台的发展，使得训练和预测任务可以由不同节点的机器同时处理，并可以在异构硬件平台上高效运行，进而促进了模型的快速迭代更新。因此，如何将训练好的深度学习模型存储和加载到生产环境中成为了技术人员面临的一大难题。本文就如何在分布式环境下安全地保存和加载深度学习模型进行探讨，并给出相关解决方案。
# 2.核心概念与联系
在深度学习中，大型模型往往需要分布式存储和计算才能实现高速的训练和推理。这里主要提到的就是模型存储和加载两个主要的技术。模型存储，是指将训练好的模型参数或模型结构保存到磁盘或数据库中，供后续使用；模型加载，则是从保存的模型中读取参数或结构，并根据这些参数或结构对深层神经网络进行初始化，再根据输入特征进行前向传播预测。由于深度学习模型可能非常庞大，不仅占用大量的硬盘空间，而且还可能在内存中驻留较多的中间变量，因而需要合理地管理模型的生命周期，才能确保系统的稳定性。
# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
为了简化模型保存和加载的过程，提升模型的可靠性和效率，出现了一些分布式模型保存与加载框架。如Google TensorFlow中的tf.train.Saver()类，其提供一个保存模型参数和结构的接口，并支持多个保存点（Checkpoint）恢复模型训练，通过异步写入和多线程调度机制来提升模型的保存效率。与此同时，Apache Hadoop提供了HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)作为文件存储和管理工具，可以将模型数据存储在HDFS上，并设置副本策略来确保高可用性。Hadoop MapReduce作为集群运算框架，可以用来进行模型的并行化处理，降低整个系统的延迟。
下面详细讲述Google TensorFlow的tf.train.Saver()类及相关功能，包括：

1.概览
TensorFlow提供了tf.train.Saver()类来保存和加载模型参数。该类封装了C++实现的通用保存器和恢复器。通过调用tf.train.Saver()类的save()方法保存模型参数到文件，然后再调用restore()方法恢复参数。

下面是tf.train.Saver()类的接口定义:
```python
class Saver(object):
  def __init__(self,
               var_list=None,
               reshape=False,
               sharded=False,
               max_to_keep=5,
               keep_checkpoint_every_n_hours=10000.0,
               name="saver"):
    """Creates a `Saver` object.

    This class provides convenience methods to save and restore variables in the
    graph. The constructor adds operations to the graph to save and restore
    variables. It also provides methods to apply gradients to variables during
    training.

    Example usage:

    ```python
    # Create some variables
    v1 = tf.Variable(..., name='v1')
    v2 = tf.Variable(..., name='v2')
   ...

    # Add ops to save and restore variables
    saver = tf.train.Saver({'my-var': v1})

    # Later, launch the model, initialize variables, do some work, etc...

    # Save the variables to disk
    save_path = saver.save(sess, "/tmp/model.ckpt")
    print("Model saved in file: %s" % save_path)

    # Restore variables from disk
    saver.restore(sess, "/tmp/model.ckpt")
    print("Model restored.")
    ```

    Note that when you restore variables from disk, the values of the variables
    are updated to those stored on disk. If there is a conflict between the new
    values in your program and the values stored on disk, the values stored on
    disk will be used. To avoid this, make sure that the variable definitions in
    your code and the checkpoint files match exactly.

    Args:
      var_list: A list of `Variable` objects, typically `tf.trainable_variables`.
        If None, defaults to all saveable variables.
      reshape: If True, add operations to reshape variables as they are loaded.
        Useful when changing the shape of variables during training. Default is False.
      sharded: If True, save and restore variables individually instead of
        all at once. When sharding is enabled, any shared global resources such
        as tables are not included in the checkpoint files by default. Instead,
        restoring these shared resources must be handled separately after loading
        the checkpoint files. See documentation for details. Defaults to False.
      max_to_keep: The maximum number of recent checkpoints to keep. As new
        checkpoints are created, older ones are deleted. If None or 0, no
        checkpoints are deleted. Defaults to 5 (that is, the 5 most recent
        checkpoints are kept).
      keep_checkpoint_every_n_hours: How often to keep one checkpoint per trained
        model. This option only takes effect if max_to_keep is set. If
        `keep_checkpoint_every_n_hours` is set to 10, then every 10 hours since
        the last saved checkpoint, a new checkpoint will be created. This can
        be useful if you want to later analyze how well your model did at each
        checkpoint. In this case, setting `max_to_keep` to 1 would ensure that
        only the most recent checkpoint is kept. Set to -1 to disable periodic
        saving. Defaults to 10,000 (that is, checkpoints are kept for 10,000
        hours, i.e., 24 days).
      name: Optional name for the operations created by the initializer.

    Raises:
      ValueError: If the `sharded` parameter is true but there are shared
          resources among the variables in `var_list`, which means that it's
          impossible to save them together in a single file. In this case, please
          use sharding with caution.

  def save(self, sess, save_path, global_step=None, latest_filename=None,
           meta_graph_suffix="meta", write_meta_graph=True):
    """Saves the parameters to a checkpoint file.

    Creates a checkpoint file in a given directory with state representing the
    `Session` argument `sess`. One can later restore this state using a call to
    `tf.train.Saver().restore()`.

    Args:
      sess: A session containing the variables to be saved.
      save_path: Path where we should save the parameters.
      global_step: Optional `int64` scalar `Tensor`, indicating the number of
        training steps completed so far. If None, defaults to the current value
        of the global step tensor.
      latest_filename: Name of the file holding the pathname of the latest
        checkpoint. Usually "checkpoint". Used for backwards compatibility with
        very old checkpoints.
      meta_graph_suffix: Optional string appended to `save_path` to create the
        filename for the serialized MetaGraphDef. Defaults to "meta".
      write_meta_graph: Boolean indicating whether or not to write the meta graph
        file. By default, the meta graph file is written. Passing `False` could be
        useful if you don't need access to the Graph proto.


    Returns:
      The path of the newly created checkpoint file.

    Raises:
      RuntimeError: If called in Eager mode.

    @compatibility(eager)
    Do not use this method when eager execution is enabled. Variables are saved
    automatically when using eager execution. Please refer to [Saving and Restoring
    for more information about how to manage variables during training.
    @end_compatibility
  def restore(self, sess, save_path, meta_graph_file=None):
    """Restores previously saved parameters from a checkpoint file.

    Restored variables have their values filled in from the corresponding saved
    values in the checkpoint file. If a variable does not exist in the
    checkpoint file, its value is initialized by calling its initializer op
    (if defined).

    Caution: For backward compatibility reasons, this function uses both a
    deprecated file naming scheme based on "checkpoint" and an alternative
    filename specified by the caller via the `latest_filename` argument. Only
    one of these arguments should be provided at a time. Also note that restoring
    from a file with different weights than the current graph can cause
    unexpected behavior. Make sure to use the same graph, data pipeline, and other
    factors that were used when the original model was trained.

    Args:
      sess: A session into which the variables will be restored.
      save_path: Path where parameters were previously saved. Can be a file
        name if `latest_filename` is set, or a directory if `checkpoint` is being
        used. Alternatively, one can pass a `tf.train.SaverDef` protocol buffer
        obtained from a previous call to `tf.train.export_meta_graph()` to reload
        a specific version of the graph.
      meta_graph_file: DEPRECATED: Use `save_path` instead. Name of the file
        holding the serialized `MetaGraphDef` protocol buffer. MetaGraphDef and
        SavedModel are two distinct serialization formats. If `save_path` points
        to a directory, the latest meta graph file within that directory is used.
        Otherwise, if `save_path` ends in ".pbtxt", it is assumed to point to a
        text format file that contains the serialized MetaGraphDef. If `save_path`
        ends in ".meta", it is assumed to contain the binary format file that
        contains the `MetaGraphDef` protocol buffer. Finally, if `save_path`
        refers to a specific SavedModel directory (i.e., containing
        "saved_model.pb"), it reloads the SavedModel from that directory without
        further configuration. If None, attempts to load the most recently
        checkpointed version. May also be a `tf.train.SaverDef` protobuf.

    Returns:
      An operation that restores the params from the checkpoint file.

    Raises:
      TypeError: If `save_path` doesn't seem to specify a valid checkpoint or
        SavedModel location.
      IOError: If the checkpoint files cannot be read for whatever reason.

    """Writes out a `MetaGraphDef` protocol buffer to `filename`.

    The `MetaGraphDef` describes the network architecture and related metadata
    of a TensorFlow computation; it does not include the actual parameter values.
    Thus one can share the saved `MetaGraphDef` file without the corresponding
    checkpoint file, even across machines with different architectures.

    When building a `SavedModel`, typically only the top-level `tf.MetaGraphDef`
    is exported (which captures the complete tf.Graph), while lower level
    subgraphs may optionally be added using the `Builder` interface. Exporting a
    subset of the full graph via collections requires passing in a customized
    `saver_def` that specifies which variables to include/exclude in the
    SavedModel.

    If no `filename` is provided, the meta graph is returned as a
    `tf.MetaGraphDef` protocol buffer.

    Args:
      filename: Optional filename where we should write the meta graph
        (`MetaGraphDef`) protocol buffer. Note that extensions like `.meta`,
        `.index`, `.data-*` may be appended by the implementation. Defaults to
        `None`.
      collection_list: List of additional collection names beyond
        `GraphKeys.GLOBAL_VARIABLES` to add to the `MetaGraphDef`. Defaults to
        empty.
      saver_def: Instance of `tf.SaverDef` containing the signatures to save and
        restore variables in the `MetaGraphDef`. Defaults to the `Saver`'s own
        `saver_def` property.
      builder: An instance of `tf.saved_model.builder.SavedModelBuilder` used to
        build a SavedModel. Required if exporting a subgraph via a collection.
      clear_devices: Whether to remove device specifications from the `NodeDefs`
        in the exported graph. Defaults to True.
      export_scope: Optional `string` specifying the name scope to remove. Only
        nodes whose names begin with this scope will be included in the
        resulting graph definition. Defaults to `None`, which exports the entire
        graph.
      strip_default_attrs: Boolean indicating whether default-valued attributes
        should be stripped from the `NodeDefs`. Defaults to False.
      main_op: Main op to run before restoring variables from the SavedModel.
        This represents the first trainable op created inside the SavedModel
        construction API. Defaults to `None`, which runs no op.
      raw_meta_graph_def: Deprecated alias for `metagraph_def`.
      assets_collection: Collection where extra assets used by the graph are
        registered. Defaults to `GraphKeys.ASSET_FILEPATHS`.

    Returns:
      A `tf.MetaGraphDef` protocol buffer if no `filename` was provided, otherwise
      returns nothing.

    Raises:
      ValueError: If `filename` is not a valid path or `assets_collection` does
        not contain any elements.
      TypeError: If `filename` has an unsupported extension.
      AssertionError: If multiple `meta_graph_defs` are passed to `builder`.
