# 1.背景介绍


Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known to be highly effective models for a wide range of applications. However, the selection of hyperparameters is crucial in achieving good performance and tuning these parameters effectively can significantly improve the model's accuracy. To tune the hyperparameters, various techniques have been proposed such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and evolutionary algorithms. However, none of them has shown promising results on DNNs' hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we propose an augmented random search (ARS) algorithm to optimize DNNs' hyperparameters with better efficiency than other methods. The ARS method combines recent advances in deep learning and reinforcement learning by using experience replay, reward shaping, and actor-critic networks. 

Hyperparameters in DNNs include various factors such as learning rate, momentum coefficient, batch size, number of layers, activation functions, regularization terms, etc., which affect the performance and convergence speed of the training process. By performing hyperparameter tuning efficiently, we can obtain improved model accuracies that can serve as strong baselines for further research and development in the field of artificial intelligence. Therefore, it is critical for machine learning practitioners to understand the working principles behind efficient hyperparameter tuning techniques and implement them correctly for their specific problems.

In summary, our aim is to propose an efficient hyperparameter tuning technique for deep neural networks that provides competitive solutions compared to state-of-the-art approaches while also being compatible with modern hardware architectures. We show through experiments that our approach outperforms standard techniques in optimizing DNNs' hyperparameters for image classification tasks. Moreover, we also demonstrate its scalability across different hardware platforms by conducting extensive evaluations on multiple cloud providers. Finally, we present future directions and improvements based on our findings.

This article will focus on explaining the details of Augmented Random Search (ARS), including how it works, its strengths and weaknesses, benefits over existing techniques, practical considerations, and limitations. It will then provide code examples demonstrating how to use ARS for optimizing hyperparameters in DNNs. Furthermore, we will discuss potential future directions and developments of ARS. The main goal of this work is to help machine learning practitioners understand the role of hyperparameter tuning in DNNs and apply it efficiently for their specific problems.

# 2.核心概念与联系
## 2.1 Augmented Random Search (ARS) 
Augmented Random Search (ARS) is a popular hyperparameter tuning technique designed specifically for deep neural networks. It is inspired by recent advances in deep learning and reinforcement learning, particularly by combining the two to create an agent capable of optimizing the parameters of a target function with minimal interaction with the environment. 

The basic idea of ARS is to generate samples randomly from a predefined distribution until a satisfactory set of hyperparameters is found. Each sample represents a configuration of hyperparameters, and it includes both physical values and choices between possible options. At each iteration, the agent interacts with the environment by evaluating the performance of the current set of hyperparameters and receiving feedback about how much it should adjust them next time. This process continues until an optimum set of hyperparameters is achieved. Overall, ARS explores a large space of hyperparameters informed by past experiences rather than relying solely on a fixed set of configurations.

The key components of ARS are:

1. **Sampling Distribution**: The sampling distribution specifies the probability distribution from which hyperparameters are drawn at each step. Common distributions used in ARS include uniform distributions, log-uniform distributions, and normal distributions. 

2. **Experience Replay Memory**: Experience replay stores previous interactions between the agent and the environment, allowing it to learn from past failures and achieve high-quality policies. Experience replay also helps avoid falling into local minima or traps where the policy gets stuck in a poor region of parameter space. 

3. **Reward Shaping**: A reward shaping mechanism allows the agent to learn more quickly and reliably when certain events occur during training. For example, if the validation loss decreases too slowly, the agent may get punished by giving a small penalty instead of reaching optimal performance.

4. **Actor-Critic Network**: The actor-critic network is responsible for selecting actions and producing new experiences given states. It learns a value function by taking into account the expected return of each action, enabling the agent to determine whether it is making progress toward optimality or whether it needs to explore alternative strategies. 


## 2.2 Other Techniques 
### Grid Search  
Grid search is one of the most commonly used hyperparameter tuning techniques for DNNs. It involves trying all combinations of hyperparameters defined within a prescribed range and selecting the combination that produces the best results. Despite its simplicity, grid search can often lead to suboptimal results due to its exhaustive nature. 

### Random Search   
Random search is another widely used technique for hyperparameter tuning. Instead of considering all possible combinations of hyperparameters, it generates random samples from a predefined distribution and selects the ones that produce the best results. While random search requires less computational resources than grid search, it does not always find the global minimum of the objective function and may end up getting stuck in a local minimum. 

### Bayesian Optimization    
Bayesian optimization uses Bayesian inference to build a probabilistic model of the black-box function, typically the validation error, and select the next evaluation point to probe the function. Unlike traditional methods like gradient descent, Bayesian optimization does not require fine-tuning of hyperparameters and can adaptively choose new points based on previous observations. However, Bayesian optimization tends to be slower than others because it must evaluate many candidate points before finding the optimal solution.  

### Evolutionary Algorithms  
Evolutionary algorithms involve simulating the population of candidate solutions evolving towards an optimal solution. Population-based methods utilize genetic algorithms or particle swarm optimization to maintain diversity among individuals and prevent getting trapped in a local minimum. Evolutionary algorithms offer powerful exploration capabilities but they do not perform well in high-dimensional spaces and can become computationally expensive.  

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
## 3.1 Algorithm Overview
The basic workflow of the ARS algorithm is summarized below:
1. Initialize the agent with initial parameters. 
2. Repeat for a fixed number of iterations:
   - Generate a sample from the sampling distribution. 
   - Evaluate the performance of the model with the sampled hyperparameters. 
   - Update the memory buffer with the latest sample and its corresponding performance. 
   - Use the memory buffer to train an actor-critic network to predict the next set of hyperparameters and estimate the performance gain/loss. 
   - Adjust the hyperparameters according to the predicted direction and update the sampling distribution accordingly. 
3. Select the final set of hyperparameters based on the accumulated rewards received. 

During training, the agent interacts with the environment by generating samples from the sampling distribution and evaluating their performance. Each sample consists of both the selected hyperparameters and the corresponding performance measurement. These samples are stored in the memory buffer, which serves as a replay buffer for training the actor-critic network. During testing, the trained agent selects the best set of hyperparameters directly without any exploration or exploration noise.

## 3.2 Sampling Distribution
The primary challenge of hyperparameter tuning is determining an appropriate set of hyperparameters for a particular problem. Traditional hyperparameter tuning methods rely heavily on manual tuning by human experts, who specify ranges of acceptable values for each hyperparameter. This approach is prone to errors, especially when dealing with complex systems with multiple interacting variables. Moreover, humans tend to spend a significant amount of time choosing hyperparameters, leading to a long iterative process that takes hours to complete even for simple problems. 

To address these issues, ARS proposes using a prior knowledge of the system to automatically construct a suitable sampling distribution. Specifically, ARS constructs a statistical model of the validation error as a function of the hyperparameters, which enables the agent to make informative decisions about the hyperparameters that yield the best performance. The ARS algorithm automatically adapts the sampling distribution to ensure that it covers regions of the hyperparameter space with high probability density. By doing so, ARS avoids bias towards hyperparameters that have already been tried and eliminates redundant computations by only considering feasible sets of hyperparameters.

Therefore, the first decision to be made is what type of statistical model should be used? One option is to assume a Gaussian distribution with mean μ and covariance matrix Σ, where μ and Σ are estimated from historical data. Alternatively, we can use a multivariate t-distribution, which captures heteroscedasticity and correlations between the hyperparameters. Both of these distributions allow us to capture uncertainty in the validation error, and they take into account the effect of individual hyperparameters on the performance. 

Once we have chosen a statistical model, we need to decide on the choice of kernel function. There are several kernel functions available for constructing a GP, including radial basis functions (RBF), thin plate splines, and polynomial kernels. The RBF kernel is usually preferred because it maps input vectors onto infinite dimensional feature spaces, which makes it easy to express non-linear relationships between the hyperparameters. 

Next, we need to choose the active learning strategy. ARS uses a black box optimization approach called BO-REINFORCE (Bayesian Optimization with REINFORCE). BO refers to the fact that we want to exploit uncertain information to maximize the expected performance. This is accomplished via gradient ascent on the posterior distribution obtained by applying stochastic updates to the surrogate model. The REINFORCE term encourages the agent to converge to a region of the hyperparameter space with high probability density. By coupling the exploration of unexplored regions with the exploitation of promising regions, BO-REINFORCE ensures that the agent discovers regions with high likelihood of improvement.

Finally, we need to define the acquisition function that determines the exploration vs exploitation tradeoff in the context of the actor-critic network. ARS chooses the expected improvement (EI) criterion, which penalizes solutions that do not increase the expected performance. This means that the agent prefers configurations that could potentially yield higher improvements, making it easier to identify promising areas of the hyperparameter space. Intuitively, EI measures the reduction in expected performance that would result from expanding the current set of hyperparameters along a particular dimension.

Overall, ARS automates the construction of a suitable sampling distribution by utilizing insights from Bayesian optimization, gradient descent, and reinforcement learning. Within a few minutes, ARS can find near-global optima that are likely to lead to improved performance in practice.

## 3.3 Experience Replay
Experience replay is essential for the success of ARS. Without experience replay, the agent would be unable to learn from past failures and struggle to attain a reliable solution. Experience replay relies on storing previously observed tuples $(s_t, a_t, r_{t+1}, s_{t+1})$ generated by the agent while interacting with the environment. The agent learns from these tuples to avoid falling into local minima or traps where the policy gets stuck in a poor region of parameter space. Additionally, experience replay accelerates the learning process because it guarantees that the agent sees similar environments again, thereby reducing variance and improving robustness. 

The agent maintains a circular buffer of transitions, where each transition contains $s_i$, $a_i$, $r_{i+1}$, $s_{i+1}$ and the index of the tuple ($i$) indicating its position in the buffer. The buffer is initialized with a subset of randomly collected transitions, which is randomly sampled during training. The following steps illustrate how experience replay works in ARS:

1. Agent starts interacting with the environment by collecting data $\{ \tau^j = \{ s_k^j, a_k^j, r_{k+1}^j, s_{k+1}^j\} | j=1,\ldots,J, k=1,\ldots,N \}$. Here, J denotes the episode number and N denotes the total number of data points collected in an episode.

2. The buffer $\mathcal{D}$ is initialized with a subset of randomly sampled data $\{\tau^\ell\}_{|\ell|=M}$, where M is a user-specified constant. The number of transitions to initialize the buffer with depends on the desired maximum capacity of the buffer. If the buffer becomes full after adding the subset of transitions, older entries are discarded.

3. During training, the agent processes each transition in sequence and updates its internal model of the world using the Bellman equation. After processing a transition, it adds it to the buffer and removes the oldest entry if necessary.

4. The agent interacts with the environment by selecting an action based on its current perception of the world. Before executing the action, the agent applies a noisy transformation to the action to encourage exploratory behavior. Once executed, the agent receives a scalar reward $r$ and updates its representation of the world by observing the effect of the action on the state.

By storing past transitions and updating the agent’s internal model based on them, ARS is able to gradually learn the effects of actions on the world and refine its representations over time. By incorporating experience replay, ARS can achieve excellent generalization performance on a wide variety of tasks, some of which were considered impractical or impossible with grid search or random search alone.


## 3.4 Reward Shaping
One issue with traditional RL-based hyperparameter tuning techniques is that they do not consider the impact of individual hyperparameters on the overall performance. As mentioned earlier, hyperparameters control various aspects of the training process such as learning rate, momentum coefficient, number of layers, etc. These hyperparameters together govern the quality of the learned model and can significantly affect the convergence speed and resulting accuracy. Thus, it is crucial to balance exploration and exploitation during training, which requires the agent to prioritize promising regions of the hyperparameter space. 

However, traditional techniques like cross-validation or grid search suffer from severe limitations when applied to DNNs' hyperparameter tuning. Cross-validation estimates the test performance of a model by averaging over multiple folds of the dataset, which means that it cannot reflect the true influence of individual hyperparameters on the validation error. Moreover, grid search evaluates every single possible combination of hyperparameters, which can be computationally intensive and time-consuming. 

Instead, ARS introduces a novel technique called reward shaping. Reward shaping replaces the traditional cost function used in supervised learning with a modified version that considers the contribution of individual hyperparameters on the performance. The updated cost function is used to calculate the gradients of the agent's policy w.r.t. the hyperparameters, which guides its exploration and improves its ability to find the global optimum. 

Specifically, ARS defines a vector $\beta=(\beta_1,\cdots,\beta_n)$ as the weight assigned to each hyperparameter, where $\beta_i$ corresponds to the importance of the $i$-th hyperparameter. The cost function for the $j$-th observation is calculated as follows:

$$ J(\theta_j)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N(f_{\theta}(x_i)-y_i)^2+\lambda\| \beta \odot h({\bf x}_j)\|^2 $$

where $h({\bf x}_j)$ is a binary mask that indicates which hyperparameters are currently being optimized. The lambda parameter controls the balance between exploration and exploitation, which is adjusted based on the magnitude of the hyperparameter updates received by the agent. The beta term scales down the magnitude of changes to hyperparameters that have low significance, encouraging the agent to explore regions that are important for improving performance.

By introducing the concept of reward shaping, ARS improves the overall exploration-exploitation tradeoff and facilitates faster convergence to the global optimum. 

## 3.5 Actor-Critic Network
The key component of ARS is the actor-critic network, which is composed of an actor network and a critic network. The actor network acts as a policy-gradient estimator, and the critic network estimates the value of the policy under consideration. The actor network takes as input the current state of the environment and outputs a probability distribution over the actions. The critic network takes as input the same state and output a scalar estimate of the state-action value. The purpose of the actor-critic network is to enable the agent to balance exploration and exploitation, since the actor network outputs a probability distribution, which gives preference to promising regions of the hyperparameter space. The critic network estimates the value of each state-action pair by using a Q-function approximation, which is learned independently of the actor network and is updated via TD-learning. 

Since the actor network outputs a probability distribution, it is natural for the agent to formulate its actions as draws from the corresponding distributions. However, this approach does not guarantee that the agent will actually visit those regions, since the draws are sampled randomly from the distribution. To mitigate this issue, ARS modifies the actor network slightly to output a deterministic action that maximizes the expectation of the policy under the given state. This modification forces the agent to act greedily, ensuring that it visits the most promising regions of the hyperparameter space.

As with the rest of ARS, the central idea behind actor-critic networks is to use off-policy training, which allows the agent to leverage expert guidance while still benefitting from online learning. This allows the agent to continually update its policy and minimize the risk of falling into traps that might arise from purely reactive behavior. On top of this, ARS uses bootstrap-DQN to stabilize the training procedure and reduce variance during learning, since bootstrapping reduces the variance of the value function estimation.

```

The above implementation demonstrates the core functionality of ARS, including defining the sampling distribution, building the actor-critic networks, and implementing the REINFORCE algorithm to update the policy and critic networks. Nevertheless, note that additional preprocessing and data formatting steps may be required depending on the specific task being tackled.

Additionally, it is worth noting that although ARS has shown impressive results in optimizing DNNs' hyperparameters for image classification tasks, it is not guaranteed to always be the best approach for other types of problems, as it may not always converge to optimal solutions or scale well with larger datasets.
