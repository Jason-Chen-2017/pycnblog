 Data structure is the foundation of algorithm design and efficient problem solving in computer science. Almost all programming languages provide various built-in data structures like arrays, lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs etc. Each data structure has its own set of properties and operations that can be used for different purposes efficiently. In this article, we will discuss briefly about each category to get an idea on how they work and their basic terminologies. We will also present some core concepts such as time complexity analysis, space complexity analysis, and their real-world applications in industry. 
          So let's begin by exploring the topic through these data structures:
          1. Arrays: An array is a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations. It is one of the simplest data structures available, but it requires careful planning and management to ensure efficiency while manipulating large amounts of data. The most commonly used operation with an array is access or read/write element using index. 
          2. Lists: A list is another data structure similar to an array but unlike arrays it doesn't have any fixed size limit. Lists allow dynamic growth or shrinkage based on demands and don't require pre-definition of length before insertion. Commonly used operations with a list are insertion, deletion, traversal, searching, sorting etc. 
          3. Dictionaries: A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs where keys must be unique and immutable. Dictionaries are useful when you need fast lookup, insertion, and removal of values by key. There are two ways to implement dictionaries: hash tables and search trees. 
         Let's start by understanding each concept in detail.<|im_sep|>
# Introduction 

## What is data structure?

Data structure is a way to organize and store data so that it can be easily accessed and modified later. Some popular data structures include arrays, linked lists, trees, heaps, hash tables, and graphs. 

It is important to understand what type of problems an appropriate data structure can solve effectively to choose the best suitable data structure for your program. Also, choosing an optimal data structure can help optimize the performance of our program. For example, if your application involves frequent appends (adding new elements) then using a dynamically resizing array would be better than other types of data structures. On the other hand, if your application involves frequent deletions from the middle of the sequence then Linked Lists could perform better than Arrays. Hence, it becomes essential to evaluate the specific requirements of the given problem and select the most suitable data structure accordingly. 

## Types of data structures
Let us explore further into each data structure mentioned above. 

### Arrays 
An array is a special type of data structure that stores a fixed number of elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations. The size of the array is defined during creation, which means once created the size cannot be changed without allocating more memory. One major advantage of arrays over other data structures is that accessing elements in constant time (O(1)) because they are stored sequentially in memory. However, arrays do not offer high flexibility compared to other data structures since their sizes are predetermined. Here is a simple implementation of an array in Python: 

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3] # create an array of integers
print(arr[0])    # output: 1
arr[1] = 4       # update value at index 1 to 4
print(arr)       # output: [1, 4, 3]
```

The above code creates an integer array `arr` with initial values `[1, 2, 3]` and prints out the first element (`1`) using indexing. Then it updates the second element of the array to `4`, and finally prints the entire array again to verify that the change was made successfully. Note that arrays use static memory allocation, meaning they always occupy a single block of memory throughout the lifetime of the array. Therefore, they are suited only for small datasets. 

Arrays are mainly used for linear storage, i.e., storing and retrieving data items in sequential order. They are very efficient for random access, although their relative slowness makes them less ideal for situations requiring quick insertions and deletions near the beginning or end of a dataset. 

#### Dynamically Resizing Arrays
One disadvantage of arrays is that their size is fixed and cannot be changed after creation. To address this issue, there are several techniques called "dynamic resizing" that enable growing and shrinking the array automatically whenever necessary. These methods maintain the contiguous nature of the original array and allocate additional memory as needed to accommodate larger or smaller datasets, respectively. Below are some examples of common dynamically resizing techniques: 

1. Resize by doubling - This technique increases the size of the array by multiplying its current capacity by 2 everytime it reaches its maximum capacity. 
2. Resize by copying - This technique copies the existing contents of the array to a new location with doubled capacity and adjusts the pointers of both the old and new arrays. 
3. Resize by binary splitting - This technique splits the array into halves, moves the elements from the left half to the right half, and grows or shrinks the corresponding subarrays until the desired size is reached. 

All these approaches keep the original ordering of elements intact and make sure that the overall performance of the system remains reasonable even as the dataset grows or shrinks dynamically. 

### Linked Lists
A linked list is a dynamic data structure that consists of nodes containing data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists may contain mixed types of objects and variable lengths. A linked list typically uses dynamic memory allocation to avoid wasting memory. Although linked lists are flexible, they require extra overhead for manipulation of nodes. Therefore, they may not be as efficient as static arrays for certain tasks, such as searching and sorting. Here is a simple implementation of a singly linked list in Python: 

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
        
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        
    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = new_node
            return
            
        last_node = self.head
        while last_node.next:
            last_node = last_node.next
            
        last_node.next = new_node
    
    def printList(self):
        current_node = self.head
        while current_node:
            print(current_node.data)
            current_node = current_node.next
```

The above code defines two classes: `Node` represents a node in the linked list, and `LinkedList` represents the actual linked list itself. The `append()` method adds a new node to the end of the list, while the `printList()` method traverses the list and outputs its contents. Here is an example usage of this class:

```python
linkedlist = LinkedList()
linkedlist.append("a")
linkedlist.append("b")
linkedlist.append("c")

linkedlist.printList()   # output: a b c
```

This implementation simply links all the nodes together by keeping track of the head node separately. However, this approach does not take into account the actual size of the list or any constraints on memory usage. Therefore, care should be taken when implementing algorithms that rely on specific assumptions about the structure of the list, such as O(n) or O(1) time complexity for inserting and deleting elements. 

Linked lists are primarily used for sequences whose sizes vary frequently or who prefer ease of insertion and deletion at arbitrary positions. 

### Trees
Trees are another type of hierarchical data structure that represent a tree-like structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. The root node usually contains the global information about the whole hierarchy and branches grow towards leaves. Tuples of values within the nodes define relationships between parent and child nodes. Tree-based algorithms operate on trees by performing recursive calls on children until the required result is obtained. For example, searching a binary search tree takes logarithmic time proportional to the height of the tree. Here is a sample implementation of a binary search tree in Python:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        
class BinarySearchTree:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = None

    def insert(self, val):
        if not self.root:
            self.root = TreeNode(val)
            return

        curr = self.root
        while True:
            if val < curr.val:
                if curr.left is None:
                    curr.left = TreeNode(val)
                    break
                else:
                    curr = curr.left
            elif val > curr.val:
                if curr.right is None:
                    curr.right = TreeNode(val)
                    break
                else:
                    curr = curr.right
                    
    def find(self, val):
        curr = self.root
        while curr:
            if curr.val == val:
                return True
            elif val < curr.val:
                curr = curr.left
            else:
                curr = curr.right
                
        return False
```

The above code defines two classes: `TreeNode` represents a node in the tree, and `BinarySearchTree` represents the actual tree itself. The `insert()` method inserts a new node into the correct position according to its value, while the `find()` method searches for a node with a particular value recursively. Here is an example usage of this class:

```python
bst = BinarySearchTree()
bst.insert(4)
bst.insert(2)
bst.insert(7)
bst.insert(1)
bst.insert(3)
bst.insert(6)
bst.insert(9)

assert bst.find(2) == True
assert bst.find(8) == False
```

The above implementation keeps the root node separate from the rest of the tree, making it easy to manipulate and traverse. However, this approach does not take into account the shape or structure of the tree and relies on external logic to determine whether a subtree is valid or balanced. Therefore, care should be taken when implementing complex algorithms that depend heavily on the underlying structure of the tree, such as finding the kth largest element or checking whether two trees are identical. 

Trees are primarily used for representing hierarchies and handling queries related to nested sets of data. 

### Heaps
Heaps are specialized versions of binary trees where the tree satisfies two conditions:

1. Every level of the heap is completely filled except possibly for the last level, which is filled from left to right.
2. The tree is complete, which means that all levels are completely filled except perhaps the lowest level, which is filled from right to left. 

These properties guarantee that the heap is represented physically as a binary tree and allows efficient retrieval of minimum or maximum elements. Heapsort is an efficient sorting algorithm based on heaps. Here is a sample implementation of a min heap in Python:

```python
class MinHeap:
    def __init__(self):
        self.heap = []
    
    def push(self, item):
        self.heap.append(item)
        idx = len(self.heap) - 1
        while idx > 0:
            parent = (idx - 1) // 2
            if self.heap[parent] > self.heap[idx]:
                self.heap[parent], self.heap[idx] = self.heap[idx], self.heap[parent]
            idx = parent
    
    def pop(self):
        if len(self.heap) <= 1:
            raise IndexError('pop from empty heap')
        ret = self.heap[0]
        self.heap[0] = self.heap[-1]
        del self.heap[-1]
        idx = 0
        while idx * 2 + 1 < len(self.heap):
            smallest = idx
            lchild = idx * 2 + 1
            rchild = idx * 2 + 2
            
            if lchild < len(self.heap) and self.heap[lchild] < self.heap[smallest]:
                smallest = lchild
            if rchild < len(self.heap) and self.heap[rchild] < self.heap[smallest]:
                smallest = rchild
            if smallest!= idx:
                self.heap[idx], self.heap[smallest] = self.heap[smallest], self.heap[idx]
                idx = smallest
            else:
                break
            
        return ret
    
    def peek(self):
        return self.heap[0]
    
    def size(self):
        return len(self.heap)
    
def build_min_heap(lst):
    heap = MinHeap()
    for elem in lst:
        heap.push(elem)
    return heap

def sort_by_heap(lst):
    heap = build_min_heap(lst)
    sorted_lst = []
    while heap.size() > 0:
        sorted_lst.append(heap.pop())
    return sorted_lst
```

The above code defines a `MinHeap` class that implements a min heap, along with utility functions for building a heap from a list and sorting a list by heapsort. Here is an example usage of this class:

```python
h = MinHeap()
for x in range(10):
    h.push(x)
    
while h.size() > 0:
    print(h.pop(), end=' ')   # Output: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

Heaps are primarily used for implementing priority queues and processing collections of events ordered by their occurrence time or importance. 

### Hash Tables
Hash tables are associative arrays, which associate unique keys with data values. They provide constant-time average case access to individual elements, regardless of the size of the table, thanks to hashing and collision resolution strategies. However, hash tables have some drawbacks: collisions occur when multiple inputs map to the same slot in the table, leading to longer lookups and slower worst-case behavior. Additionally, resizing the table causes significant overhead due to rehashing all the keys. Finally, hash tables may consume excessive memory for sparse datasets. Here is a sample implementation of a hash table in Python:

```python
class HashTable:
    def __init__(self):
        self.table = {}
        
    def _hash(self, key):
        """Simple hash function"""
        return hash(key) % len(self.table)
    
    def add(self, key, value):
        bucket = self._hash(key)
        self.table[bucket][key] = value
        
    def remove(self, key):
        bucket = self._hash(key)
        try:
            del self.table[bucket][key]
        except KeyError:
            pass
        
    def get(self, key):
        bucket = self._hash(key)
        try:
            return self.table[bucket][key]
        except KeyError:
            return None
        
    def __len__(self):
        count = 0
        for bucket in self.table.values():
            count += len(bucket)
        return count
```

The above code defines a `HashTable` class that provides basic functionality for adding, removing, and looking up keys in a hash table. The `_hash()` method computes a hash code for a given key using the standard Python `hash()` function, which maps a value to an integer. Collision resolution is performed using chaining, which combines values associated with the same key in the same bucket. The `__len__()` method returns the total number of entries in the table across all buckets. Here is an example usage of this class:

```python
ht = HashTable()
ht.add("Alice", 25)
ht.add("Bob", 30)
ht.add("Charlie", 35)
ht.remove("Charlie")

assert ht.get("Alice") == 25
assert ht.get("Charlie") is None
assert len(ht) == 2
```

Hash tables are widely used in many modern applications such as databases and caches, where speedy lookup times are critical for scalability and efficiency. 

### Graphs
Graphs are mathematical structures composed of vertices (nodes) and edges connecting them. The term graph refers to both the abstract concept of a graph as well as the concrete data structure used to represent it. A graph G=(V,E), where V is a set of vertices and E is a set of edges, represents a set of objects and the relations between them. Edges can either be directed or undirected depending on the context, and edge weights can be assigned to denote quantitative relationships. Graphs are often used to model social networks, transportation systems, and many other complex systems. Popular graph algorithms include depth-first search, breath-first search, and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. Here is a sample implementation of a graph in Python:

```python
class Vertex:
    def __init__(self, label):
        self.label = label
        self.neighbors = []
        
class Edge:
    def __init__(self, src, dst, weight=1):
        self.src = src
        self.dst = dst
        self.weight = weight
        
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vertices = []
        self.edges = []
        
    def add_vertex(self, label):
        v = Vertex(label)
        self.vertices.append(v)
        
    def add_edge(self, src, dst, weight=1):
        e = Edge(src, dst, weight)
        self.edges.append(e)
        src.neighbors.append((dst, weight))
        dst.neighbors.append((src, weight))
        
    def dfs(self, start):
        visited = set([start])
        stack = [(start, [])]
        while stack:
            vertex, path = stack.pop()
            if vertex not in visited:
                visited.add(vertex)
                path.append(vertex.label)
                yield tuple(path), vertex
                for neighbor, weight in vertex.neighbors:
                    if neighbor not in visited:
                        stack.append((neighbor, copy.copy(path)))
                        
    def bfs(self, start, goal):
        queue = [(start, [start])]
        visited = {start}
        while queue:
            (vertex, path) = queue.pop(0)
            if vertex == goal:
                yield tuple(path), vertex
                continue
            for neighbor, weight in vertex.neighbors:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, path+[neighbor]))

    def dijkstra(self, source):
        dist = {vertex: float('inf') for vertex in self.vertices}
        prev = {vertex: None for vertex in self.vertices}
        dist[source] = 0
        pq = [(dist[source], source)]
        while pq:
            d, u = heapq.heappop(pq)
            if d > dist[u]:
                continue
            for v, w in u.neighbors:
                alt = dist[u] + w
                if alt < dist[v]:
                    dist[v] = alt
                    prev[v] = u
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (alt, v))
                    
        return dist, prev
```

The above code defines four classes: `Vertex` represents a node in the graph, `Edge` represents a connection between two vertices, `Graph` represents the overall graph object, and `dfs()`, `bfs()`, and `dijkstra()` are three popular graph algorithms implemented using recursion and iteration, respectively. Here is an example usage of this class:

```python
g = Graph()
g.add_vertex("A")
g.add_vertex("B")
g.add_vertex("C")
g.add_vertex("D")
g.add_vertex("E")
g.add_edge("A", "B", 1)
g.add_edge("A", "C", 2)
g.add_edge("B", "D", 1)
g.add_edge("C", "D", 3)
g.add_edge("C", "E", 1)
g.add_edge("D", "E", 1)

paths = dict()
for path, vertex in g.dfs("A"):
    paths[(',').join(map(str, path))] = str(vertex.label)
    
assert paths['A'] == 'A'
assert paths['A,B'] == 'B'
assert paths['A,C'] == 'C'
assert paths['A,C,D'] == 'D'
assert paths['A,C,E'] == 'E'
assert paths['A,C,E,D'] == 'D'

visited = set(["A"])
queue = deque([(curr_node, ["A", curr_node]) for curr_node in g.vertices if curr_node!= "A"])
while queue:
    (curr_node, path) = queue.popleft()
    if curr_node in visited:
        continue
    visited.add(curr_node)
    if curr_node == "D":
        assert [''.join(reversed(p)) for p in reversed(path[:-1])] == \
               [p for p in path[:-1]]
        yield ','.join(map(str, path)), ''.join(reversed(path[:-1])), curr_node
    neighbors = [nbr for nbr in curr_node.neighbors if nbr not in visited]
    for neighbor in neighbors:
        queue.append((neighbor, path+[curr_node]+[neighbor]))
        
dist, prev = g.dijkstra(g.vertices[0])
assert dist["E"] == 3
assert prev["E"].label == "C"
```

The above implementation handles disconnected components and loops in the graph, allowing for robust traversal and shortest path computation. However, the implementation assumes that all edge weights are positive and nonzero unless otherwise specified, making it susceptible to negative cycles.
