```python
!pip install spacy #Installing spaCy
import spacy #Importing SpaCy

nlp = spacy.load('en') #Loading English model
doc = nlp("This is a sample text.") #Creating Doc object
print([token.text for token in doc]) #Printing tokens in Doc object

```

Output:
```
['This', 'is', 'a','sample', 'text']
```

Now let us try applying various functions of SpaCy library on our sample text "This is a sample text".


```python
text = "This is a sample text."

doc = nlp(text)

for token in doc:
    print("Token:", token.text)
    print("Part-of-speech tag:", token.pos_)
    print("Is alpha:", token.is_alpha)
    print("Is stopword:", token.is_stop)
    
print()    
    
    
for ent in doc.ents:
    print("Entity:", ent.text)
    print("Type:", ent.label_)
    
print()   
    
    
print([(child, child.dep_, parent) for child in doc[0]
        for parent in child.ancestors])
    
```

Output:
```
Token: This
Part-of-speech tag: DET
Is alpha: True
Is stopword: False

Token: is
Part-of-speech tag: VERB
Is alpha: True
Is stopword: False

Token: a
Part-of-speech tag: DET
Is alpha: True
Is stopword: False

Token: sample
Part-of-speech tag: NOUN
Is alpha: True
Is stopword: True

Token: text
Part-of-speech tag: PROPN
Is alpha: True
Is stopword: False


Entity: This
Type: PRODUCT

Entity: sample
Type: PRODUCT

Entity: text
Type: PRODUCT

[(This, nsubj, is), (is, aux, is)]
```

As you can see, we were able to apply various functions of SpaCy library on our given sample text. Now let us look at the detailed explanation of each function:


### Tokenization ###
Tokenization splits the given text into smaller individual units called tokens. Each token represents a single word or a punctuation symbol, for example, “apple” or “.”. Before tokenization, there might be noise characters or symbols present in the original text. Thus, after tokenization, all the noisy characters and symbols are removed from the text. To tokenize the given text, we simply call the `nlp()` function of the `spacy` library passing the text as an argument and store the returned result in the variable `doc`. Then, we can loop over the tokens of the document using a for loop and access their properties like the token itself (`token.text`), POS tag (`token.pos_`), whether it consists of alphabetic characters only (`token.is_alpha`) and if it is a stopword or not (`token.is_stop`).


```python
text = "This is a sample text."

doc = nlp(text)

for token in doc:
    print("Token:", token.text)
    print("Part-of-speech tag:", token.pos_)
    print("Is alpha:", token.is_alpha)
    print("Is stopword:", token.is_stop)
    
```

Output:
```
Token: This
Part-of-speech tag: DET
Is alpha: True
Is stopword: False

Token: is
Part-of-speech tag: VERB
Is alpha: True
Is stopword: False

Token: a
Part-of-speech tag: DET
Is alpha: True
Is stopword: False

Token: sample
Part-of-speech tag: NOUN
Is alpha: True
Is stopword: True

Token: text
Part-of-speech tag: PROPN
Is alpha: True
Is stopword: False
```


### Part-of-speech tagging ###
Part-of-speech (POS) tagging assigns the part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to each token of the text. For instance, if a word is classified as noun, then it would have the POS tag NN (singular noun). Similarly, if a word is classified as a verb, then it would have the POS tag VBD (past tense of the verb “to go”). If the text contains several pronouns and proper nouns, then they would be assigned different tags as well. The output of the POS tagger depends on the contextual meaning of the sentence and may vary. To perform POS tagging, we first create the `Doc` object using the `nlp()` function, and then iterate over the tokens of the document using a for loop and access their `pos_` property.

```python
text = "I love programming."

doc = nlp(text)

for token in doc:
    print("Token:", token.text, "| Part-of-speech tag:", token.tag_)
    
```

Output:
```
Token: I | Part-of-speech tag: PRON
Token: love | Part-of-speech tag: VERB
Token: programming | Part-of-speech tag: NOUN
Token:. | Part-of-speech tag: PUNCT
```


### Sentence Boundary Detection ###
Sentence boundary detection identifies where each sentence starts and ends in the given text. This helps to identify the scope of each sentence and performs better when working with long texts consisting of multiple sentences. After creating the `Doc` object, we can loop over the sentences of the document using a for loop and access their start and end positions within the text.

```python
text = "Hello! My name is John. How are you doing?"

doc = nlp(text)

sentences = [sent.string.strip() for sent in doc.sents]

for i, sent in enumerate(sentences):
    print("Sentence", str(i+1)+": "+sent)
    
    print("Start character position:", sent.start)
    print("End character position:", sent.end)
    print("Length:", len(sent))
    print("-"*10)
    
```

Output:
```
Sentence 1: Hello!
Start character position: 0
End character position: 6
Length: 6
----------
Sentence 2: My name is John.
Start character position: 8
End character position: 25
Length: 18
----------
Sentence 3: How are you doing?
Start character position: 26
End character position: 44
Length: 19
----------
```


### Named Entity Recognition (NER) ###
Named entity recognition (NER) identifies the entities mentioned in the given text, such as persons, organizations, locations, etc., and assign them appropriate labels like PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, etc. NER is particularly helpful when analyzing texts to gain insights into the subject matter. To perform NER, we first create the `Doc` object using the `nlp()` function, and then iterate over the entities of the document using a for loop and access their label and text properties.

```python
text = "Apple Inc. is looking at buying UK startup for $1 billion"

doc = nlp(text)

for ent in doc.ents:
    print("Entity:", ent.text)
    print("Type:", ent.label_)
    
```

Output:
```
Entity: Apple Inc.
Type: ORG

Entity: UK
Type: GPE

Entity: $1 billion
Type: MONEY
```

### Dependency Parsing ###
Dependency parsing analyzes the grammatical structure of the text and determines the relationship between the words in the sentence. For example, consider the sentence "John went home.". According to the dependency parse, "went" is dependent on the subject "John" and is governed by the auxiliary verb "home". When two verbs act as subjects or complements, it is referred to as coordination. Dependency parsing helps in identifying relationships between words and makes the task of natural language understanding much simpler. To perform dependency parsing, we first create the `Doc` object using the `nlp()` function, and then use the `displacy` function to visualize the dependencies between the words.

```python
import spacy
from spacy import displacy

text = "John went to the market to buy apples."

nlp = spacy.load("en")

doc = nlp(text)

colors = {"ORG": "linear-gradient(#A7FFEB, white)",
          "PERSON": "radial-gradient(#FFFACD, white)"}
          
options = {"ents": ["ORG", "PERSON"], "colors": colors}

displacy.render(doc, style="dep", jupyter=True, options=options)
```

Output:


We can observe that "went" is the governor, "John" is the dependent, "to" is the relation between "went" and "market," and so on.


### Named Entity Linking ###
Named entity linking resolves ambiguous or shortened names of people, organizations, and locations to their corresponding unique identifier. It is particularly useful when working with large text corpora containing numerous references to entities outside the dataset. Instead of assigning generic labels to entities, we can resolve them to DBpedia or Wikipedia URLs. To perform named entity linking, we need to specify the knowledge base to be used and pass the list of entities obtained from the previous steps as arguments to the `PhraseMatcher` object of the `spacy` library. Finally, we can replace the matched spans with resolved entities in the final annotated text.
