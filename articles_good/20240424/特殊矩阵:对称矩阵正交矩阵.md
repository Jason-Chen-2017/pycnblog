In linear algebra and computer science, matrices are arrays of numbers or values arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are widely used in various fields such as image processing, natural language processing, machine learning, and optimization algorithms. In these fields, we often encounter special types of matrices like symmetric matrices and orthogonal matrices, which have unique properties and applications.

## Core Concepts and Connections
-----------------------------

### Symmetric Matrices

A symmetric matrix is a square matrix where all elements on the diagonal are equal, i.e., $$A = A^T$$where $A^T$ is the transpose of matrix $A$. Symmetric matrices have the following properties:

* The trace (迹) of a symmetric matrix is zero, i.e., $\mathrm{tr}(A) = 0$
* The singular values (奇异值) of a symmetric matrix are non-negative

### Orthogonal Matrices

An orthogonal matrix is a square matrix where each row and column is mutually orthogonal, i.e., $$Q^T Q = I$$where $Q$ is an orthogonal matrix, and $I$ is the identity matrix. Orthogonal matrices have the following properties:

* The inverse of an orthogonal matrix is its transpose, i.e., $Q^{-1} = Q^T$
* The singular values of an orthogonal matrix are ±1

## Algorithmic Implementation
---------------------------

### Symmetric Matrices

Symmetric matrices can be computed using the following steps:

1. Compute the transpose of matrix $A$, $A^T$
2. Check if the matrix satisfies symmetry, i.e., $A = A^T$
3. If it does, then $A$ is a symmetric matrix

### Orthogonal Matrices

Orthogonal matrices can be computed using the following steps:

1. Compute the transpose of matrix $Q$, $Q^T$
2. Check if the matrix satisfies orthogonality, i.e., $Q^T Q = I$
3. If it does, then $Q$ is an orthogonal matrix

## Mathematical Models and Formulas
----------------------------------

### Symmetric Matrices

Assuming we have a symmetric matrix $A$, its eigenvalues (特征值) are real numbers that can be calculated using the following formula:

$$\det(A - \lambda I) = 0$$where $\lambda$ is a scalar, and $I$ is the identity matrix.

### Orthogonal Matrices

Assuming we have an orthogonal matrix $Q$, its eigenvalues are ±1 that can be calculated using the following formula:

$$QQ^T=I$$

## Practical Applications
------------------------

Symmetric matrices and orthogonal matrices have numerous practical applications in various fields, including:

* Image processing: Symmetric matrices are used for image filtering, image transformation, while orthogonal matrices are used for image recognition, image compression.
* Machine learning: Symmetric matrices are used for kernel function calculation, while orthogonal matrices are used for feature extraction and dimension reduction.
