Finally, we'll discuss potential future trends and challenges with Python and provide suggestions on where to go from here. This guide assumes that you have basic knowledge of mathematics, computer science fundamentals, and working proficiency in other programming languages.

         # 2.基础知识回顾
          ## 2.1 数据类型
          1. Numbers - Integers, Floats, Complex numbers
          2. Strings - Characters enclosed within single quotes or double quotes
          3. Lists - Collections of ordered items separated by commas inside square brackets []
          4. Tuples - Similar to lists but cannot be changed once defined
          5. Dictionaries - Collection of unordered key-value pairs separated by colons inside curly braces {}
          
          ```python
            x = 7    # integer assignment
            y = 3.14   # float assignment
            z = complex(x,y)     #complex number assignment

            my_string = "Hello world"      # string assignment
            my_list = [1, 2, 3]            # list assignment
            my_tuple = (1, 'a', True)       # tuple assignment
            
            my_dict = {
                'name': 'John', 
                'age': 30, 
                'is_student': True  
            }        # dictionary assignment
          ```

          ## 2.2 Variables & Expressions
          1. Assignment Operator - "="
          2. Arithmetic Operators - +, -, *, /, //, %, ** 
          3. Comparison Operators - ==,!=, >, <, >=, <=
          4. Logical Operators - and, or, not
          5. Identity operators - is, is not
          6. Membership operator - in, not in

          Examples:
          ```python
            x = 5           # variable assignment
            y = 2 * x + 1   # expression calculation
            if age > 18 and name!= '':
                print('Welcome!')
            
            spam = 'eggs'
            if 'g' in spam:
              print("Yes, 'g' is present in the string")
          ```
          ## 2.3 Control Flow Statements

          1. If Statement - Executes block of code if condition is true
          2. For Loop - Iterates over sequence of values until break statement is executed
          3. While Loop - Executes loop body while condition remains true
          4. Break/Continue statements - Exit loops prematurely based on conditions
          5. Try/Except blocks - Catch and handle errors gracefully

          Example:
          ```python
            # example usage of control flow statements

            value = 9
            if value % 2 == 0:
               print("The number is even.")
            else:
               print("The number is odd.")

            squares = []
            for i in range(10):
                squares.append(i**2)

            total = 0
            n = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))
            for num in range(n+1):
                total += num
            print("Sum of first", n, "natural numbers:", total)

            count = 0
            while count < 5:
                print("Count:", count)
                count += 1
                if count == 3:
                    continue
                elif count == 5:
                    break
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a valid integer!")
      ```
      
      ## 2.4 Functions
      1. Syntax - def function_name():
      2. Parameters - Optional input arguments which are passed into functions when called
      3. Return Value - Output returned by a function

      Example:
      ```python
        # define a simple function

        def greetings():
            print("Hello, World!")
        
        # call the function
        greetings() 

        # define a function with parameters

        def add_numbers(num1, num2):
            return num1 + num2
            
        result = add_numbers(2, 4) 
        print(result) # output: 6

        # lambda functions are also available in Python
    
        f = lambda x: x**2  
        print(f(3))    # output: 9
      ```
      
      ## 2.5 Modules
      1. Introduction - Separate files containing reusable code that can be imported into your program
      2. Usage - Import modules to reuse existing functionality or create customizations 
      3. Types - There are two types of modules - built-in and third-party

      Built-in modules:
      These modules are included in Python distribution and ready to use without any additional installation. Some common built-in modules include `os`, `sys`, `math`, `json`, etc. To import these modules, we need to use their names as follows:

      Third-party modules:
      These modules are written by others and may require installation before they can be used. Some popular third-party modules include `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `tensorflow`, etc. We can install them using pip command line tool.

Example:
```python
    # importing os module

    import os
    
    current_dir = os.getcwd()
    print("Current directory:", current_dir)

    file_names = os.listdir('.')
    print("List of files and directories in current directory:")
    print(file_names)

    # installing and importing pandas module

   !pip install pandas

    import pandas as pd
    
    df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
    print(df)
```

# 3.Python Data Structures

In Python, there are various data structures like tuples, lists, sets, dictionaries etc. Each data structure is designed to store different type of data efficiently and allows performing operations such as adding elements, removing elements, accessing specific elements, iterating over elements etc. The following sections will explain each of these data structures briefly along with the operations that can be performed on them.

1. List
	Lists are collection of items arranged in a particular order. They allow duplicate elements unlike tuple. Lists are mutable so its size can change during runtime. Here are some commonly used methods of List. 

	`list()` - creates a new empty list
	
	`len()` - returns the length of the list
	
	`[]` - indexing and slicing operation
	
	`.append()` - adds an element at the end of the list
	
	`.pop()` - removes and returns the last element of the list
	
	`.remove()` - removes the first occurrence of an element from the list
	
	`.count()` - returns the frequency of an element in the list
	
	`.extend()` - appends all the elements from one list to another
	
	Here’s a small example to show some of the above methods:

		>>> my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
		>>> len(my_list)
		3
		>>> my_list[0]
		'apple'
		>>> my_list[-1]
		'cherry'
		>>> my_list[:]
		['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
		>>> my_list[1:]
		['banana', 'cherry']
		>>> my_list[:2]
		['apple', 'banana']
		>>> my_list.append('orange')
		>>> my_list
		['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']
		>>> my_list.pop()
		'orange'
		>>> my_list
		['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
		>>> my_list.remove('banana')
		>>> my_list
		['apple', 'cherry']
		>>> fruit = 'banana'
		>>> my_list.count(fruit)
		1
		>>> fruits = ['mango', 'papaya', 'grapes']
		>>> my_list.extend(fruits)
		>>> my_list
		['apple', 'cherry','mango', 'papaya', 'grapes']


2. Tuple
	Tupels are similar to lists but immutable. Once created, elements cannot be added, removed or modified. So tupels are preferred when we don't want to modify the contents after creation. Here are some commonly used methods of Tuple. 

	`tuple()` - creates a new empty tuple
	
	`len()` - returns the length of the tuple
	
	`[]` - indexing and slicing operation
	
	`+` - concatenates two tuples
	
	Here’s a small example to show some of the above methods:
		
		>>> my_tuple = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')
		>>> len(my_tuple)
		3
		>>> my_tuple[0]
		'apple'
		>>> my_tuple[-1]
		'cherry'
		>>> my_tuple[:]
		('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')
		>>> my_tuple[1:]
		('banana', 'cherry')
		>>> my_tuple[:2]
		('apple', 'banana')
		>>> t1 = (1, 2, 3)
		>>> t2 = (4, 5, 6)
		>>> t1 + t2
		(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)


3. Set 
	Sets are collection of unique elements. Sets are useful for removing duplicates, finding intersection between multiple sets etc. Here are some commonly used methods of Set. 

	`set()` - creates a new empty set
	
	`add()` - adds an element to the set
	
	`update()` - updates the set with the union of itself and another iterable object
	
	`remove()` - removes the specified element from the set
	
	`discard()` - remove the specified element if it is present in the set, otherwise do nothing
	
	`clear()` - Removes all the elements from the set
		
	Here’s a small example to show some of the above methods:

		>>> my_set = {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}
		>>> len(my_set)
		3
		>>> 'banana' in my_set
		True
		>>> my_set.add('date')
		>>> my_set.remove('banana')
		>>> my_set.discard('cherry')
		>>> my_set
		{'apple', 'date'}


4. Dictionary
	Dictionaries are key-value pair collections where keys must be unique and immutable. Elements in a dictionary are accessed using the keys. Values associated with keys can be updated or added. Dictionaries are mutable objects. Here are some commonly used methods of Dictionary.

	`{}` - creates a new empty dictionary
	
	`[]` - access elements in the dictionary using keys
	
	`.keys()` - returns a view object of the dictionary keys
	
	`.values()` - returns a view object of the dictionary values
	
	`.items()` - returns a view object of the dictionary item tuples
	
	`.get()` - returns the value for the given key if it exists in the dictionary, otherwise returns default value
	
	`.update()` - updates the dictionary with the key-value pairs from another mapping object or iterable
	
	`.pop()` - removes the element with the specified key from the dictionary and returns its value
	
	Here’s a small example to show some of the above methods:

		>>> my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}
		>>> len(my_dict)
		2
		>>> my_dict['name']
		'John'
		>>> my_dict.keys()
		dict_keys(['name', 'age'])
		>>> my_dict.values()
		dict_values(['John', 30])
		>>> my_dict.items()
		dict_items([('name', 'John'), ('age', 30)])
		>>> my_dict.get('phone', None)
		None
		>>> phone = my_dict.pop('phone', None)
		>>> phone
		None
		>>> my_dict['address'] = '123 Main St.'
		>>> my_dict
		{'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'address': '123 Main St.'}
		>>> new_dict = {'salary': '$1,000,000'}
		>>> my_dict.update(new_dict)
		>>> my_dict
		{'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'address': '123 Main St.','salary': '$1,000,000'}
