         Threading is the process of executing multiple threads simultaneously on a single processor or core in order to improve the performance of an application. In multithreaded programming, each thread runs independently without interfering with other threads, resulting in increased performance compared to sequential programming where all tasks are performed by one thread at a time. Java provides support for multithreading using its own threading model known as the Java threading API (JTA). It includes classes such as `Thread`, `Runnable`, `Callable` etc., which can be used to create and manage threads. Additionally, it also includes synchronization mechanisms like locks, semaphores, conditions, barriers, etc., which can be used to protect shared resources from concurrent access by different threads. 
         In this article, we will discuss about two important concepts of multithreading - threading and synchronization. We will start by defining some basic terminologies such as "Concurrency", "Parallelism" and "Synchronization". Then we will proceed to explain various concurrency models available in Java including "Single-Threaded Programming Model", "Multi-Threaded Programming Model using the Executor Framework" and "Multi-Threaded Programming Model using Threads directly." After that, we will move on to explore synchronization primitives offered by Java including "Locks", "Atomic Classes", "Monitors", "Volatile Variables" and more. Finally, we will conclude our analysis by discussing common pitfalls faced when dealing with multi-threaded applications. 
         
         
         # 2.基本概念术语说明
         
         Before understanding the multithreaded programming model in Java, let us briefly understand some fundamental terms and their meanings.
          
          ## Concurrency
          Concurrency refers to the ability of an application to execute multiple operations (tasks) concurrently without blocking. The word "concurrent" means that these operations take place in overlapping periods of time, rather than in sequence, hence it is possible for them to happen out of order. Modern operating systems provide several scheduling policies based on concurrency to ensure fair sharing of processing resources between processes. Examples of concurrency models include cooperative multitasking, preemptive multitasking, and time-sharing.
          
          
        ### Parallelism
        Parallelism refers to the ability of an application to perform multiple independent computations or tasks simultaneously across multiple processors or cores. Asynchronous parallel computing allows for greater throughput by overlapping computation and communication, allowing for improved utilization of available hardware resources. Examples of parallel algorithms include MapReduce, MPI, and OpenMP.
        
       
       ### Synchronization 
       Synchronization is the mechanism used to coordinate the activities of multiple threads in a program. A lock ensures exclusive access to a shared resource so that only one thread can access it at any given point in time. A semaphore controls access to a limited number of resources, permitting access as required but denying additional requests once the limit has been reached. Monitors synchronize the execution of threads waiting for a certain condition to become true before they resume execution. Volatile variables allow threads to read the latest value stored in memory even if another thread updates it after the current thread reads it.
       
       
      # 3.Core Algorithmic Principles
      
     The key to achieving efficient multithreading in Java is understanding how to use the built-in APIs provided by the language to efficiently handle synchronization requirements. Here's a summary of the most commonly used concurrency patterns found in modern Java applications:
    
     ## Single Threaded Programming Model
     This mode is suitable for programs that require no concurrency beyond simple task management. Any operation that takes significant amount of time or uses system resources should be delegated to separate worker threads created using `java.lang.Thread` class.
      
     
    ```java
    public static void main(String[] args){
        // code goes here
        Runnable task = new MyTask();
        Thread t = new Thread(task);
        t.start();

        // remaining code
    }

    private static class MyTask implements Runnable{
        @Override
        public void run(){
            // code to be executed in background thread
        }
    }
    ```

    
    
    ## Multi-Threaded Programming Model using the Executor Framework
    This approach involves creating fixed or cached pools of worker threads that can be reused to execute tasks submitted via a queue. Workers can either be manually constructed or managed by an executor framework such as Executors class. An example implementation would look something like this:
    
    
    ```java
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int numThreads = getThreadPoolSize();
        ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numThreads);

        for(int i=0;i<numTasks;i++){
            Runnable task = new MyTask();
            Future<?> future = pool.submit(task);

            // Do other work while thread executes task in background...

            try {
                Object result = future.get();

                // Use results returned by task..

            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            } catch (ExecutionException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }

        pool.shutdown();
    }

    private static class MyTask implements Callable<Object>{
        @Override
        public Object call() throws Exception {
            return calculateResult();
        }

        private Object calculateResult(){
            // compute result here
            return null;
        }
    }
    ```


    ## Multi-Threaded Programming Model using Threads Directly
    This mode involves spawning new threads explicitly instead of relying on executors. This gives finer control over thread creation and cleanup, and may be necessary in situations where customizable thread factory or handler functions need to be used. An example implementation would look something like this:
    
    
    ```java
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int numThreads = getThreadPoolSize();
        List<Thread> threads = new ArrayList<>(numThreads);

        for(int i=0;i<numThreads;i++){
            Thread t = new MyThread("MyThread-" + i);
            threads.add(t);
            t.start();
        }

        // Main thread does other work while background threads execute tasks...

        for(Thread t : threads){
            try {
                t.join();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }

    private static class MyThread extends Thread{
        public MyThread(String name){
            super(name);
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            // code to be executed in background thread
            System.out.println("Hello World");
        }
    }
    ```



    # 4.Code Example & Explanation
   
    Let’s consider a scenario where we want to download multiple files from URLs asynchronously using the above three approaches mentioned earlier:

    
    ### Approach#1: Using Single Thread
    We first create a worker thread that downloads each file from URL synchronously. Since there is no requirement to parallelize the downloads, we don’t need an executor service or other utility to manage our threads. So, our solution looks like below:
    
    
    ```java
    import java.io.*;
    import java.net.*;

    public class FileDownloader {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            String urls[] = {"https://www.example.com/file1","https://www.example.com/file2"};

            // Create a new worker thread for downloading each file
            for(String url : urls) {
                Thread downloaderThread = new DownloaderThread(url);
                downloaderThread.start();
            }
        }
    }

    /** Worker thread for downloading individual file */
    class DownloaderThread extends Thread {
        private final String mUrl;

        public DownloaderThread(String url) {
            mUrl = url;
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            try {
                // Download content of file from specified URL
                InputStream inputStream = new URL(mUrl).openStream();
                byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
                FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream("/tmp/" + mUrl.substring(mUrl.lastIndexOf('/')+1));
                int bytesRead;
                while ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer))!= -1) {
                    outputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
                }
                outputStream.close();
                inputStream.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
    ```


    ### Approach#2: Using Fixed ThreadPool Executor
    Now let’s assume that the list of URLs contains thousands of entries. To avoid overloading the server with too many connections, we can restrict ourselves to a fixed number of threads. We can reuse idle threads by setting maximumPoolSize parameter to same as initialPoolSize. Our updated solution looks like below:
    
    
    ```java
    import java.io.*;
    import java.net.*;
    import java.util.concurrent.*;

    public class FileDownloader {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            String urls[] = {"https://www.example.com/file1","https://www.example.com/file2"};

            int maxNumConnections = 10;
            ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(maxNumConnections);

            // Submit each URL for downloading through executor service
            for(String url : urls) {
                executor.execute(() -> downloadFile(url));
            }

            // Shutdown executor to free up resources
            executor.shutdown();
        }

        /** Utility method to download individual file */
        private static void downloadFile(String url) {
            try {
                // Download content of file from specified URL
                InputStream inputStream = new URL(url).openStream();
                byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
                FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream("/tmp/" + url.substring(url.lastIndexOf('/')+1));
                int bytesRead;
                while ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer))!= -1) {
                    outputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
                }
                outputStream.close();
                inputStream.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
    ```



   ### Approach#3: Using Threads Directly
   Lastly, we can choose to spawn new threads for each file download directly instead of using an executor service. This allows us to customize the behavior of newly created threads, set names for easier debugging, specify priorities, and allocate appropriate amounts of memory. Here's an example:


    ```java
    import java.io.*;
    import java.net.*;

    public class FileDownloader {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            String urls[] = {"https://www.example.com/file1","https://www.example.com/file2"};

            // Spawn new threads for downloading each file
            for(String url : urls) {
                Thread downloaderThread = new DownloaderThread(url);
                downloaderThread.setName("FileDownloader:" + url);
                downloaderThread.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);
                downloaderThread.start();
            }
        }
    }

    /** Worker thread for downloading individual file */
    class DownloaderThread extends Thread {
        private final String mUrl;

        public DownloaderThread(String url) {
            mUrl = url;
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            try {
                // Download content of file from specified URL
                InputStream inputStream = new URL(mUrl).openStream();
                byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
                FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream("/tmp/" + mUrl.substring(mUrl.lastIndexOf('/')+1));
                int bytesRead;
                while ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer))!= -1) {
                    outputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
                }
                outputStream.close();
                inputStream.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
    ```


   Overall, depending upon the nature of your workload and the size of your input data, you should select the appropriate concurrency pattern that fits your needs best. By exploring the fundamentals of multithreading and synchronization techniques in Java, you can write better, more robust, and scalable software solutions that can greatly enhance the efficiency of your applications.
