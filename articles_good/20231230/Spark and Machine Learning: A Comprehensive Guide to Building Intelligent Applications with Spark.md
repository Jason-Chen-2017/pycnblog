# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解

## 3.1 Linear Regression

Linear regression is a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values. The algorithm tries to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the sum of squared errors between the predicted values and the actual values.

The linear regression model can be represented as:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \ldots + \beta_nx_n + \epsilon
$$

Where:
- $y$ is the predicted value
- $\beta_0$ is the intercept
- $\beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_n$ are the coefficients
- $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ are the input features
- $\epsilon$ is the error term

The goal of linear regression is to find the optimal values of $\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_n$ that minimize the sum of squared errors. This can be achieved using the following formula:

$$
\hat{\beta} = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty
$$

Where:
- $\hat{\beta}$ is the estimated coefficients
- $X$ is the matrix of input features
- $y$ is the vector of actual values
- $^T$ denotes matrix transposition

## 3.2 Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a machine learning algorithm used for predicting binary outcomes. The algorithm tries to find the best-fitting curve that minimizes the sum of squared errors between the predicted probabilities and the actual probabilities.

The logistic regression model can be represented as:

$$
P(y=1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \ldots + \beta_nx_n)}}
$$

Where:
- $P(y=1)$ is the predicted probability of the positive class
- $\beta_0$ is the intercept
- $\beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_n$ are the coefficients
- $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ are the input features
- $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm

The goal of logistic regression is to find the optimal values of $\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_n$ that minimize the sum of squared errors. This can be achieved using the following formula:

$$
\hat{\beta} = (X^TWX)^{-1}X^Ty
$$

Where:
- $\hat{\beta}$ is the estimated coefficients
- $X$ is the matrix of input features
- $y$ is the vector of actual values
- $W$ is a diagonal matrix with elements $w_{ii} = P(y=1)(1 - P(y=1))$
- $^T$ denotes matrix transposition

## 3.3 Decision Trees

Decision trees are non-linear machine learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks. The algorithm tries to find the best-fitting tree that minimizes the sum of squared errors or cross-entropy loss between the predicted values and the actual values.

The decision tree model can be represented as a series of nested if-else statements, where each node in the tree represents a decision rule based on an input feature.

The goal of decision trees is to find the optimal tree structure and leaf assignments that minimize the sum of squared errors or cross-entropy loss. This can be achieved using the following algorithms:

- **ID3**: A recursive algorithm that selects the best feature at each node based on information gain.
- **C4.5**: An extension of ID3 that handles missing values and continuous features.
- **CART**: A recursive algorithm that selects the best feature at each node based on Gini impurity.

## 3.4 Clustering

Clustering is a group of unsupervised learning algorithms used for grouping similar data points based on their features. The algorithm tries to find the best-fitting clusters that minimize the sum of squared errors or other distance metrics between the data points and their respective cluster centers.

The most common clustering algorithms are:

- **K-means**: An iterative algorithm that assigns data points to one of $K$ clusters based on their distance to the cluster centers.
- **DBSCAN**: A density-based algorithm that groups data points based on their density and distance to neighboring points.

The goal of clustering is to find the optimal cluster assignments that minimize the sum of squared errors or other distance metrics. This can be achieved using the following formulas:

- **K-means**:
$$
\hat{C}, \hat{Z} = \arg\min_{C,Z} \sum_{i=1}^n \min_{c \in C} ||x_i - z_c||^2
$$

Where:
- $\hat{C}$ is the estimated cluster centers
- $\hat{Z}$ is the estimated cluster assignments
- $x_i$ is the $i$-th data point
- $c$ is the $c$-th cluster center
- $||.||^2$ denotes the Euclidean distance

- **DBSCAN**:
$$
\hat{C}, \hat{Z} = \arg\min_{C,Z} \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{c \in C} \rho(x_i, z_c)
$$

Where:
- $\hat{C}$ is the estimated cluster centers
- $\hat{Z}$ is the estimated cluster assignments
- $x_i$ is the $i$-th data point
- $c$ is the $c$-th cluster center
- $\rho(.)$ denotes the distance metric (e.g., Euclidean)
