## 3.1 Tomography
Tomography, also known as reconstruction, refers to the process of reconstructing an object using X-rays. It involves dividing the radiographic space into small sections called detector elements, transmitting X-rays to those detectors at different angles, and recording the resulting images to form a complete image of the object after adding all the individual images together. The resultant image thus reveals fine structures and details not present in the original projection data.

In XRPT, two types of tomography methods are commonly used:
### Parallel beam X-ray tomography (PBT)
The most common type of PBT uses parallel rays along one axis to acquire images of the sample under study. It is usually done with high-resolution CT scanners, where each pixel corresponds to a line of X-rays passing through the scanner at a fixed angle around the scan plane. These rays are transmitted through the sample without any interference from other sources and produce focused, sharp images.

Advantages: Simple implementation, easy to use, low cost. Many institutions offer ready-made hardware solutions for this method. Can achieve accurate results even when working directly below the sample surface. Can handle complex samples with varying geometry accurately.

Disadvantages: Sensitive to deformation caused by artifacts, bulk scanning, and sample contamination. Large amounts of X-rays needed, limiting the field of view and acquisition speed. Cannot separate phases easily. Need specialized knowledge and training for operating scanners and software systems. Limited resolution due to limited number of pixels.

### Conventional Cone Beam CT (CBCT)
This type of CT is based on the idea of generating sets of cone-beam X-rays passing through the center of the object's spherical surface. Each set covers a smaller region than conventional PBT scans and therefore produces more detailed images of the object. CBCT is often used for reconstructing soft tissues, limbs, and organs, since they have characteristically large volumes compared to natural objects like cells or bones. Another advantage is that it allows the separation of materials present within the body, making it useful for understanding biological processes occurring inside them.

Advantages: Longer depth ranges possible, higher field of view, greater ability to detect subtle features and structure differences, better detail in large anatomical regions. Capable of handling highly irregularly shaped samples, including soft tissue and fluids. Cheaper than PBT but requires larger calibrated setups and specialized hardware. Less subject to noise and artifact effects than conventional PBT.

Disadvantages: Expensive and time-consuming, needs specialized skills and expertise to operate scanners and software systems, slower to generate and collect data. Limitations in terms of detection sensitivity and resolution due to nature of cone-beam propagation mechanism. May require special tools and treatments to improve signal-to-noise ratio and reduce focal blurring.


## 3.2 Reconstruction algorithms
There are several popular image reconstruction algorithms used in XRPT, including Total Variation Regularization (TV), Joint Total Variation (JTV), Least Squares Support Recovery (LSSR), and Robust OSEM (ROSEM). Each algorithm operates differently depending on the characteristics of the input data, and some may require additional parameters to optimize performance. We will discuss here briefly the main ideas behind each algorithm and how they work.

### TV regularization
Total variation regularization is a simple iterative optimization technique that aims to minimize the total variation of the difference between the observed and reconstructed images. The basic idea is to add a term to the standard least squares equation that penalizes large changes in the reconstructed image, encouraging smoothness. The step size of the updates can be controlled by setting the regularization parameter lambda.

### JTV regularization
Joint Total Variation (JTV) extends traditional TV regularization by allowing each slice of the volume to be treated separately, leading to improved convergence rates and reduced memory usage. In addition, JTV can leverage the prior knowledge of the orientation distribution of the slices to further improve reconstruction quality.

### LSSR regularization
Least Squares Support Recovery (LSSR) is another popular algorithm used in XRPT. Similar to TV regularization, it minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed and reconstructed images while ensuring support recovery. The basic principle behind LSSR is to assume that certain voxels belong to "supports" located outside the head of the model, and hence should remain constant during the reconstruction process. Hence, we can construct a sparse matrix containing zeros in the locations of supports and ones elsewhere, which can then be used to perform iterative updates to minimize the error between the observed and reconstructed images.

### ROSEM
Robust OSEM (ROSEM) is yet another approach for reconstructing volumetric medical images. It is similar to the joint-total-variation algorithm, but instead of treating each slice separately, it applies a robust weighted second order gradient descent optimization scheme to handle outliers and non-negativity constraints. Unlike previous methods, ROSEM does not rely on assuming uniformity across the domain and can recover both phase and amplitude variations simultaneously.

## 4.1 PBT方法
Parallel beam X-Ray tomography (PBT) involves dividing the sample into a grid of detector elements separated by a distance equal to the width of a single detector element. At each detector element location, the X-rays pass through the sample without any interference from other sources and are focused onto a point source lying above the sample. The collected X-ray data contains one image per detector element. By combining these images together, we get the final image of the entire sample. To ensure that the images look sharp and do not contain significant noise, the radiographers apply several filtering steps before merging the individual images together. Here are the main steps involved in PBT:
### Step 1 - Setup system
Before starting the tomography experiment, the radiographer prepares the required materials, such as the specimen to be studied, the x-ray source (usually an energy-dispersive x-ray synchrotron radiation generator) and the calibration sources (e.g. powder bed calibration sources). He also performs initial setup and adjustments to the x-ray source and detector configuration, such as adjusting the focus, adjusting the goniometer settings (if applicable) and fixing the position of the rotation stage if necessary.

### Step 2 - Align the crystal
Once the x-ray source is powered on, the radiographer aligns the crystal (or the whole specimen) to the desired position so that the X-rays converge onto the sample. Usually, alignment involves rotating the gantry so that the sample is centered in the field of view of the x-ray detector(s) and tilting the collimator so that the X-rays meet the detector(s) at the right angles relative to the sample surface. If the x-ray beam is curved due to uneven attenuation of the sample, the radiographer accounts for the curvature of the beam path and places the collimators accordingly. Once the crystal is aligned properly, the radiographer turns off the power to the x-ray source and moves to the next step.

### Step 3 - Collect raw data
After the crystal has been aligned, the radiographer begins collecting raw data using the selected x-ray source. Depending on the size of the specimen and the complexity of its appearance, the radiographer selects either continuous mode or step-and-shoot mode to take the measurements. Continuous mode consists of taking multiple measurements with the same exposure time until the full image is obtained. On the other hand, step-and-shoot mode takes multiple exposures with increasing exposure times to increase the dynamic range and capture finer structures closer to the object surface. During step-and-shoot mode, the radiographer waits for each x-ray pulse to arrive at the detector and measures the response. This procedure ensures that no dead areas nor dark currents interfere with the signal acquired by the detector. After capturing the raw data, the radiographer saves it on disk or transfers it to a central database server, depending on the size of the dataset and the available bandwidth.

### Step 4 - Image processing
After obtaining the raw data, the radiographer preprocesses it by applying several filters to remove any remaining camera noise or other distortion artifacts. Some examples of filter include flat-field correction, gamma correction, spatial smoothing, and thresholding. Additionally, the radiographer applies normalization to convert the measured intensities into physical units (e.g. counts/second or DICOM Grayscale Values). The output of the preprocessing step is a series of grayscale images corresponding to each detector element, each having dimensions proportional to the height and width of the detector element.

### Step 5 - Merge the images
Finally, the processed images are merged together using a combination of mathematical operations. For example, the images can be combined by multiplying every pixel value by a scaling factor derived from the intensity of the incident x-ray beam at that detector location. Alternatively, the images can be combined by taking the median of all detected signals or computing a mean intensity estimate. By doing so, the radiographer obtains an enhanced image of the sample, which eliminates the influence of random fluctuations and makes the image easier to analyze.

The final image obtained from PBT represents the true shape and size of the specimen and gives us insight into its internal structure and properties.

## 4.2 CBCT方法
Conventional Cone Beam CT (CBCT) is a commonly used method for reconstructing soft tissues, limbs, and organs using X-rays. The basic idea is to generate sets of cone-beam X-rays passing through the center of the object's spherical surface. As opposed to conventional PBT scans, CBCT captures finer details in large anatomical regions and enables separation of materials present within the body.

Here are the main steps involved in CBCT:
### Step 1 - Preparation
The preparation phase involves arranging the equipment, such as the x-ray source, the detector(s), and the specimen, according to the established protocol. Also, there are various safety checks and procedures to prevent accidental damage to the instrument or human body. Next, the radiologist defines the anatomical landmarks used for registration and calculates the geometric transformation parameters to register the CT image to the DICOM coordinate system.

### Step 2 - Beam pattern generation
To collect CBCT datasets, the radiologists first generate a set of predetermined cone-beam beam patterns at the positions indicated by the anatomical landmarks defined earlier. Each beam pattern focuses the X-rays onto a different region of interest within the specimen, defining a spatial partitioning of the specimen into a discrete set of subregions. The radiologist controls the beam parameters (such as angular spread, scan duration, and beam shift) to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio and minimize the impact of any artifacts.

### Step 3 - Acquisition
Next, the x-ray source generates a set of X-rays, each pointed towards the target region defined by the associated beam pattern. The X-rays penetrate the soft tissue and propagate towards the detector, which records the emission profile. The radiologist controls the amount of downsampling performed during the acquisition process to enhance the image quality and reduce computational requirements.

### Step 4 - Data postprocessing
The recorded data must now be corrected and analyzed to extract meaningful information. The first task is to correct the measured intensities for backscattering effects, i.e., losses from the internal surfaces of the specimens. Second, the cross-sectional area of each voxel is estimated by integrating over the associated beam profile. Then, the radiologist normalizes the data by subtracting the background signal level and converting the values to Hounsfield Units (HU) or Physical Mean Density (PMD). Finally, the CBCT image is segmented into regions of interest using various automatic segmentation algorithms, such as k-means clustering and active contour models.

# 5.代码实例及解释说明
## 5.1 Python代码实现
One way to implement PBT is using python libraries like numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and PyNX (a wrapper library for NanoXMl). Here is an example code snippet for performing PBT:

```python
import pylab as pl
from nexusformat import nxload, nxsetseed, nxduplicate
from scipy.ndimage import map_coordinates

def recon_pbt(inputfile, start=None, end=None, sigma=0.5, pad=True, normalize=False):
    # load NXdata group
    data = nxload(inputfile)

    # create copy of input file for writing results
    outfile ='recon_' + inputfile.split('/')[-1]
    output = nxduplicate(inputfile, filename=outfile)
    
    # read and reshape image array
    img = np.array(data['entry1']['tomo_entry']['data'][()])
    if len(img.shape)<3:
        print("Input image dimension less than 3")
        return None
    elif len(img.shape)==3:
        h,w,d = img.shape
    else:
        h,w,d,c = img.shape
        img = img.reshape((h,w,-1))
        
    # select subset of frames to process
    if start==None:
        start = 0
    if end==None:
        end   = d
    img = img[:,:,start:end]
        
    # calculate pad length for boundary effect suppression
    if pad:
        padlen = round(sigma * w / 2)
    else:
        padlen = 0
    
    # initialize reconstruction variables
    rec = np.zeros_like(img)
    weights = np.zeros_like(rec)
    scale = np.ones((img.shape[0],img.shape[1]))
    
    # loop through frame and column indices
    for j in range(-padlen,w+padlen):
        y = (-j**2/(2*(sigma)**2)+np.arange(h)-h//2)/scale[:,j]**2
        y += np.abs(y.max())
        z = np.exp(-y)
        index = [i+int(round(padlen)),j+int(round(padlen))]
        
        # apply interpolation function to each channel
        temp = []
        for c in range(img.shape[-1]):
            coeffs = map_coordinates(img[...,c].astype('float32'), [index], order=1)[...,0]
            temp.append(coeffs*z)
            
        # compute weights and update reconstruction    
        temp = np.array(temp).sum(axis=0)
        mask = z>0
        weights += mask
        rec *= (~mask)
        rec += temp*mask
    
    # divide by weights and optional normalization
    if normalize:
        rec /= img.mean()
    else:
        rec /= weights
        
     # save reconstructed image to NXdata group
    imgout = output['entry1']['tomo_entry']['data']
    imgout[:] = rec.reshape((-1,) + imgout.shape[1:])
    
    # close output file
    output.close()
    
    # plot reconstructed image
    fig, ax = pl.subplots(figsize=(12,8))
    vmax = abs(rec).max()*0.75
    ax.imshow(rec, cmap='gray', vmax=vmax)
    ax.axis('off')
    cb = pl.colorbar(shrink=.7)
    cb.ax.tick_params(labelsize=16)
    pl.show()
    
```

Let’s break down this code snippet:

1. First, we import the necessary modules – `pylab` for plotting, `nexusformat` for loading and saving NeXus files, `scipy.ndimage` for image manipulation functions, and our own custom function `recon_pbt()`.
2. We define the function `recon_pbt()` which takes four arguments – `inputfile`, `start`, `end`, and `sigma`. 
3. Within the function, we load the NeXus file specified by `inputfile` using `nxload()`, selecting the appropriate data field (`'entry1/tomo_entry/data'` in this case).
4. We check whether the loaded image is 3D (grayscale) or 4D (multichannel) and reshape it accordingly.
5. If `start` and `end` are not provided, we default to processing all frames. Otherwise, we restrict the range of frames to be processed based on the user inputs.
6. Based on the user input for padding, we determine the appropriate padding length based on the Gaussian kernel parameter `sigma`. Note that we always pad the columns of the reconstructed image beyond the actual image boundaries to suppress the edge effects produced by convolution operation. 
7. We initialize arrays for storing the reconstruction and weight maps. 
8. We loop through each pixel column index `j` in the padded image, and for each column, we calculate the Gaussian kernel `z` at that position using the formula `-y^2/(2*sigma^2)+j-h/2`, where `y` is the distance from the midline of the image.
9. We determine the corresponding row index `i` using the base point `(h/2,j)` and divide it by the square root of the horizontal scaling factor `scale[:,j]` to account for the change of scale along vertical direction due to anisotropy.
10. We find the nearest integer row index `k` and column index `l` using `np.round()` and the padding lengths determined earlier.
11. We interpolate the pixel intensities using `map_coordinates()` function from `scipy.ndimage` module. The interpolated coefficients correspond to the coefficients in Fourier series expansion of the filtered signal.
12. We accumulate the interpolated coefficients into temporary arrays `temp[]` for each color channel.
13. We combine the temporary arrays into a single reconstruction image `rec` using weighted averaging, and store the updated weights in `weights`. 
14. After looping through all columns, we divide `rec` by `weights` and optionally normalize the reconstructed image by the average intensity of the input image.  
15. Finally, we write the reconstructed image to the output file and plot it using `matplotlib.pyplot`. 

Note that this code assumes that the input image has dimensions consistent with a three-dimensional array (height x width x depth). If the image has more than three dimensions, it is assumed to be a multi-channel image and the code handles it correctly. Moreover, you could customize this code to suit your specific needs, by changing the initialization and termination conditions, choosing different interpolation schemes, or implementing different filter kernels.
