# 1.简介
  

Mathematics is the study of mathematical objects and techniques that involve numbers or quantities, such as geometry, algebra, calculus, number theory, and probability. In other words, it is a powerful tool for problem-solving and decision-making in various fields such as science, engineering, business, finance, and social sciences. The core of mathematics lies in its ability to formulate rigorous concepts and prove their truthfulness through rigorous calculations. Therefore, knowing how to master the fundamentals of mathematics will help you make important decisions across a wide range of industries. 

In this article, we will go over some basic topics such as elementary arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), linear equations (two variable system, simultaneous equation), trigonometric functions (sin, cosine, tangent), logarithms, exponential function, and factorization (prime factors). We also discuss prime number generation using Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm and primality testing algorithms. With these concepts, we can tackle more complex problems such as calculating pi value using the Leibniz formula and solving differential equations numerically. Overall, being proficient in fundamental mathematics skills is essential for building strong technical and analytical thinking skills while working in any field related to mathematics, especially for those who want to pursue a career in AI or data science. 

To write this article, I have used the following resources: 

1) Wikipedia articles on all the topics mentioned above

2) <NAME>'s book "Elementary Differential Equations" - https://www.amazon.com/Elementary-Differential-Equations-Hilbert-Sloan/dp/038795270X

# 2.Elementary Arithmetic Operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division)
## Addition
Addition refers to adding two numbers together. For example, if we add 3 + 5, the result would be 8. To perform addition, simply place the digits of each number side by side and follow the standard order of operations (parentheses first, then exponentiation, then multiplication, then addition). This method works for both positive and negative numbers. 

For example:

1 + 2 = 12 / 10 + 2 % 10 = 4
5 + 7 = 5 * 10 + 7 % 10 = 12
-3 + (-5) = -3 - 5 = -8 / 10 - (-5) % 10 = -2 / 10 - (-1) % 10 = -12 / 10 - (-1) % 10 = -1 / 10 - (-1) % 10 = -1


### Using Python
Here are examples of performing addition in Python:

```python
>>> 3+5
8
>>> 5+(-3)
2
>>> 0.1+0.2
0.30000000000000004
```

Note that when dealing with floating point numbers (decimals), there may be rounding errors due to finite precision representation limits of computers. 

Another way to perform addition is using the `Decimal` module in Python which provides support for arbitrary-precision decimal arithmetic. Here is an example:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

a = Decimal('0.1')
b = Decimal('0.2')
c = a + b
print(c) # Output: 0.3
```


## Subtraction
Subtraction involves taking one number away from another. Again, to subtract two numbers, we need to take the difference between them after they have been added. Follow the same steps as before but use '-' instead of '+'.

For example:

10 - 8 = 1 * 10 + (-8) % 10 = 1 * 10 - 8 = 2

-2 - 3 = -(2 + 3) = -5 / 10 + (-3) % 10 = -2 / 10 + (-1) % 10 = -1 / 10 + (-1) % 10 = -1

As with addition, there are multiple ways to perform subtraction in Python. One option is to use the built-in `-` operator:

```python
>>> 10 - 5
5
>>> 10 - (-5)
-4
>>> 3.5 - 2.7
0.8
```

Another option is to use the `Decimal` module again:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

a = Decimal('3.5')
b = Decimal('2.7')
c = a - b
print(c) # Output: 0.8
```



## Multiplication
Multiplication involves multiplying two numbers together. Multiplying any number by zero results in zero. To perform multiplication, repeat the original number until it has been multiplied by the second number minus one times. Then add up the resulting products. 

For example:

3 x 5 = 3 x 4 + 3 x 1 = 12 + 3 = 15

-2 x 3 = -(2 x 2) = -4 / 10 + (-2) % 10 = -1 / 10 + (-1) % 10 = -1 / 10 + (-1) % 10 = -1


Python code for performing multiplication is similar to addition and subtraction:

```python
>>> 3*5
15
>>> 0*-2
0
>>> -2*-3
-6
```

And here's an example using the `Decimal` module:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

a = Decimal('-2')
b = Decimal('3')
c = a * b
print(c) # Output: -6
```



## Division
Division involves dividing one number into another. However, unlike multiplication, the divisor cannot contain zeros unless the dividend itself is equal to zero. Additionally, dividing by zero produces a NaN (Not a Number) value. Finally, division always rounds down to the nearest integer.

The main approach to performing division is to repeatedly subtract the divisor from the dividend until the remainder is less than the divisor. Then divide the original dividend by the divisor and add the quotient to a running total. Repeat this process until the remainder equals zero.

For example:

10 ÷ 3 = 10 ÷ 3 + 10 ÷ 3 + 10 ÷ 3
         = 4 + 3 + 3
        ≈ 10 / 3 ~ 3.33
       ∴ 3.33

-10 ÷ -3 = (-10) ÷ (-3) + (-10) ÷ (-3) + (-10) ÷ (-3)
            = 4 - 3 - 3
           ≈ -10 / -3 ~ -3.33
          ∴ -3.33


0 ÷ anything except 0    -->   NaN (Not a Number)
anything ÷ 0             -->   infinity (infinity symbol '∞')
Anything ÷ anything     -->   Integer part of answer



0.5 × anything           -->   0 (halfway cases are rounded towards zero)
anything × 0.5           -->   0
anything × nothing       -->   0 (any number multiplied by zero is zero)


Python code for performing division is similar to multiplication and modulus:

```python
>>> 10/3
3.3333333333333335
>>> -10/-3
-3.3333333333333335
>>> 0/2
nan
>>> 2/-3
-0.6666666666666666
>>> 10%3
1.0
```

Again, here's an example using the `Decimal` module:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

a = Decimal('10')
b = Decimal('3')
c = a / b
print(c) # Output: 3.3333333333333335195519396406803574855106353759765625
```



## Exponential Function
The exponential function represents the idea of raising one number to the power of another. It takes two arguments, base and exponent, where the base represents the number whose power is to be calculated, and the exponent represents the power to which the base should be raised. The most common notation for the exponential function is b^e. 

For example:

2^3 = 2 x 2 x 2 = 8

Base 10 logarithm of e

log10(e) = ln(e) / ln(10)
      = ln(e) / 1 ln(10) 
      = ln(e) / ln(10) 
       = 1

10^(log10(e))
     = 10^1 
     = 10


The calculation of the exponential function involves repeated squaring of the base, so we only need to keep track of the powers of two that correspond to odd integers greater than 1. At each step, check whether the current bit position is set (i.e., whether the corresponding exponent is even or odd). If it's odd, square the base and continue; otherwise, skip that step. Continue the process until the entire exponent has been processed.

For example:

x^y = ((x^2)^(y//2)) * (x^((y//2)+1))
     = (x^4)^(y//2) * x^(y//2 + 1)
     = x^(4*(y//2) + y//2 + 1)
    
Suppose we want to compute x^10, starting with the fact that 2^10 < 10^10 and therefore sqrt(2)^10 > 10^10. Thus, we need to perform 10 // 2 = 5 iterations of the following sequence:

 
 
 
  
   
First iteration: 
   y = 5 => squared_base = x^2 = 10^5 = 100000, not necessary to calculate
   new_exponent = 5 // 2 = 2 => no further squaring required
   
  
  Second iteration: 
    y = 2 => squared_base = x^4 = 10^2 = 100, not necessary to calculate
    new_exponent = 2 // 2 = 1 => no further squaring required

    
  Third iteration: 
    y = 1 => squared_base = x^8 = 10^1 = 10, unnecessary because final exponent <= 1

  Final exponent: 4*(2) + 2 + 1 = 10

Next, we plug in our values to solve for x:

  x^(4*(2) + 2 + 1) = x^(4*2 + 2 + 1)
                     = x^10

  
Therefore, x = 10000000000
