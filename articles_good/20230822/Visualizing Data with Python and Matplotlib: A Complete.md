Data visualization is a powerful tool that helps researchers and data analysts communicate insights from large datasets in an intuitive and appealing way. It also enables them to quickly identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data, which can be critical for decision-making processes. However, effective data visualization requires careful planning and attention to detail, as well as proficiency in different plotting libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. 

In this article, we will cover the essential concepts of data visualization using Python and Matplotlib library. We will first describe what matplotlib is and how it works, including its basic syntax and methods. Then, we will dive deeper into various types of plots like line charts, bar graphs, scatter plots, histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, contour plots, and piecharts, and understand their strengths and weaknesses based on common use cases. Finally, we will conclude by comparing the pros and cons of each type of plot based on personal preferences and preferences of specific audiences. This comprehensive guide should help you gain practical skills in data visualization and enhance your career opportunities. Let's get started!

# 2. Matplotlib Basics
Matplotlib is a popular open source data visualization library used in Python for creating two-dimensional visualizations of data. It provides a wide range of graph types, allowing users to create complex yet informative graphics with ease. Matplotlib is built upon NumPy arrays and is designed to integrate easily into scientific computing workflows.

Before we begin exploring individual types of plots, let's take a look at some fundamental principles behind matplotlib and its functionality. These include setting up the environment, importing necessary packages, and understanding the basic syntax and methodology. 

 ## Setting Up The Environment 
To start using matplotlib, we need to set up our environment. You can do this by running the following code snippet in your Python console:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

This imports the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries and gives us access to useful functions and classes within those libraries.

 ## Important Syntax Guidelines For Beginners 
Now that we've imported the libraries, let's go through some important guidelines for learning the basics of matplotlib. 

1. **Matplotlib vs Pyplot**: Matplotlib is a more comprehensive library than Pyplot, providing more features and flexibility. While Pyplot offers simple commands for generating simple plots, Matplotlib allows for much richer customization of plots. Therefore, it's recommended to use Matplotlib whenever possible instead of Pyplot. 

2. **Starting With Figure()**: Every time we generate a new plot, we need to create a figure object. To do this, we call the `plt.figure()` function. When called without arguments, this creates a default size figure with white background. 

3. **Subplots():** Instead of manually adding subplots one by one, we can use the `subplot()` function provided by Matplotlib. This takes three parameters - number of rows, number of columns, and index of current subplot. Index starts from 1 and increments across row first before moving down to the next column. For example, if we want to add four subplots arranged in a 2x2 grid, we would call `subplot(2, 2, i)` where i ranges from 1 to 4. 

4. **Labels:** Labeling figures, axes, and ticks are essential elements when making good plots. Use the appropriate label functions (`xlabel()`, `ylabel()`, `title()`) for each axis and title accordingly. Also, choose meaningful titles and labels for your plots so that they are clear and easy to read.  

With these guidelines in mind, let's move on to learn about the basics of Matplotlib. 

# 3. Line Charts
A line chart or line graph is a type of chart that displays information as a series of data points connected by straight lines. Each line typically represents an individual data point while the vertical axis shows the value of the data variable being plotted, while the horizontal axis indicates the corresponding independent variable. In other words, the x-axis measures something like age, height, weight, etc., whereas the y-axis measures quantitative values associated with these variables. Common uses of line charts include tracking changes over time, analyzing data trends, and displaying financial data over time. Here is an example of a simple line chart:


## Creating A Simple Line Chart Using Matplotlib

Let's now see how to create a simple line chart using Matplotlib. We'll use random data generated using NumPy and plot it against increasing integers. First, let's import the necessary modules and create some sample data:


```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate some sample data
x = np.arange(0, 10, step=0.1)   # Range between 0 and 10 with increment of 0.1
y = np.sin(x)                     # Y-values calculated as sinusoidal curve of X-values

# Create a figure object
fig = plt.figure()               

# Add a single subplot to the figure
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)        

# Plot the data on the subplot
ax.plot(x, y)                   

# Set axis labels and title
ax.set_xlabel('X-Axis')          
ax.set_ylabel('Y-Axis')          
ax.set_title('Sine Wave Plot')   

# Display the plot
plt.show()                       
```

We created a simple sine wave plot using the `plot()` function and displayed it using `plt.show()`. As expected, the plot shows a smooth curve that gradually increases towards positive infinity at the top right corner. Note that we passed the X- and Y-data as separate arrays and specified `step` argument to control the spacing between each data point. We also added labels to the axes and a title to the plot.

## Customizing The Plot 

As mentioned earlier, there are several ways to customize the appearance of a line chart. Some commonly used options include changing the color and style of the line, adjusting the thickness, markers, and transparency, and changing the legend location. Let's explore these options in more detail. 


### Changing Colors

By default, Matplotlib generates a unique color sequence for each line drawn. However, we can specify colors explicitly using the `color` parameter. For example, we can change the color of the leftmost line blue and the rightmost red:


```python
# Set custom colors for lines
colors = ['blue','red']

# Create a figure object
fig = plt.figure()            

# Add a single subplot to the figure
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)     

# Plot both lines with respective colors
for i in range(len(colors)):
    ax.plot(x, y[i], color=colors[i])
    
# Set axis labels and title
ax.set_xlabel('X-Axis')       
ax.set_ylabel('Y-Axis')       
ax.set_title('Custom Color Example')

# Show plot
plt.show()                     
```

The resulting plot looks similar to the previous one, but now the two curves are alternating colors. 

### Adjusting Thickness

We can increase the thickness of the line using the `linewidth` parameter. By default, linewidth is set to 1.0. We can decrease it to improve visibility and increase it to highlight fine details:


```python
# Increase thickess of the middle line only
lw = [1.0, 3.0]

# Create a figure object
fig = plt.figure()            

# Add a single subplot to the figure
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)      

# Plot both lines with respective thicknesses
for i in range(len(colors)):
    ax.plot(x, y[i], color=colors[i], linewidth=lw[i])
    
# Set axis labels and title
ax.set_xlabel('X-Axis')       
ax.set_ylabel('Y-Axis')       
ax.set_title('Thick Lines Example')

# Show plot
plt.show()                     
```

Here, we adjusted the width of the second line to make it stand out compared to the rest of the plot.

### Adding Markers

Markers indicate the presence of additional data points in the line. By default, Matplotlib draws markers at every data point, but we can disable this behavior using the `marker` parameter:


```python
# Disable marker for the left line
mstyle = ['o', None]

# Create a figure object
fig = plt.figure()            

# Add a single subplot to the figure
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)      

# Plot both lines with respective marker styles
for i in range(len(colors)):
    ax.plot(x, y[i], color=colors[i], linestyle='-', marker=mstyle[i])
    
# Set axis labels and title
ax.set_xlabel('X-Axis')       
ax.set_ylabel('Y-Axis')       
ax.set_title('Marker Style Example')

# Show plot
plt.show()                     
```

Note that we disabled markers for the left line by specifying `'None'` for its `marker` parameter. Now, the left line appears to consist entirely of solid dots rather than curved ones.

### Transparency

Transparency controls the opacity of the line, where zero means completely transparent and one means opaque. We can modify this option using the `alpha` parameter:


```python
# Change alpha value for the bottom line
alp = [0.5, 1.0]

# Create a figure object
fig = plt.figure()           

# Add a single subplot to the figure
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)    

# Plot all lines with respective alphas
for i in range(len(colors)):
    ax.plot(x, y[i], color=colors[i], alpha=alp[i])
    
# Set axis labels and title
ax.set_xlabel('X-Axis')         
ax.set_ylabel('Y-Axis')         
ax.set_title('Opacity Example')

# Show plot
plt.show()                      
```

Here, we increased the alpha value of the bottom line slightly to achieve better contrast with the other lines.

### Legend Location

Finally, we can add a legend to the plot to provide context for the meaning of each line. We can position the legend above, below, or to the side of the plot using the `loc` parameter:


```python
# Define locations for the legend
locs = ['upper right', 'lower left']

# Create a figure object
fig = plt.figure()             

# Add a single subplot to the figure
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)      

# Plot all lines with respective alphas
for i in range(len(colors)):
    ax.plot(x, y[i], color=colors[i], alpha=alp[i],
            label='Curve %d' % (i+1))

# Add legend with specified location
leg = ax.legend(loc=locs[i%2])   

# Set axis labels and title
ax.set_xlabel('X-Axis')          
ax.set_ylabel('Y-Axis')          
ax.set_title('Legend Locations Example')

# Show plot
plt.show()                        
```

Here, we created a legend using the `legend()` function and specified its location according to a counter variable `i`. Since we have two curves, we needed two locations. Once we've added the legend, we update its position using `(i%2)` expression to alternate between upper right and lower left positions.
