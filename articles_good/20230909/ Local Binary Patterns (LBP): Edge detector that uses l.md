# 1.简介
  

Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is a feature descriptor for texture classification and object recognition [1]. It was introduced by Leibe et al in their paper "Robust textural features for image classification" in 2002. The LBP algorithm has been widely used as an efficient alternative to convolutional neural networks for computer vision tasks such as object detection or face recognition. 

The basic idea of the LBP algorithm is based on calculating the difference between adjacent pixel intensities. By considering only these differences, we can identify regions with different texture characteristics even when they are rotated or distorted. In other words, it extracts simple but effective binary patterns that contain information about the edges and corners of objects.

One drawback of traditional edge detection methods like Canny edge detector and Sobel filter is that they detect too many false positives due to edge thinning and thickening caused by noise or small details in the image. On the contrary, LBP always produces highly accurate results because it relies solely on intensity differences and does not use any complex techniques such as derivatives or filters. Thus, LBP is more suitable for applications where high accuracy and precision are essential.

In this article, I will explain how to implement and apply the LBP algorithm to images using Python programming language. We will also see some examples of LBP applied to real-world problems such as foreground segmentation, pansharpening, object recognition, etc.


# 2.基本概念及术语说明
## 2.1.Image Representation
To describe the pixels of an image mathematically, we need to represent them in a way that makes sense. One commonly used representation is the gray scale image representation, which represents each pixel value as a single number between 0 and 1. This representation is intuitive because it directly corresponds to the perception of light intensity in each color channel. However, gray scale images may lose important contextual information present in the original image such as textures or edges. Therefore, we often resort to additional representations such as RGB (red-green-blue) triplets or HSV (hue-saturation-value) triplets to capture more detailed information from the image.

Another approach is to consider the image as a collection of vectors representing its constituent pixels. Each vector contains three components: red, green, and blue values corresponding to the colors in the pixel. This allows us to preserve the spatial relationships among pixels and captures more contextual information. While both approaches have advantages, gray scale images are simpler to work with since most machine learning algorithms can handle them easily without having to learn abstract concepts such as color or shape. Additionally, gray scale images can be processed faster than RGB or HSV images due to reduced dimensionality. Finally, both representations provide a common framework for comparing two images visually.

## 2.2.Patch and Histogram
A patch is a region of the image defined by a given size $k \times k$. For example, if we choose $k=3$, then we create a 3x3 patch around every pixel in the image. Intuitively, a patch represents a local neighborhood of pixels that share similar texture or color properties. To compute the LBP of a patch, we first convert it into a histogram of oriented gradients called ODGH [2]. An ODGH histogram counts the number of times each gradient orientation occurs in the patch. Specifically, we count the number of occurrences of the positive gradient ($\pm g_r$), negative gradient ($\pm g_c$), and diagonal gradient directions ($g_{rc}$). These directional gradients correspond to changes in brightness towards the right, left, up, down, and anti-diagonal directions respectively. Based on these counts, we assign each pixel in the patch a binary label indicating whether it belongs to a particular cell of the LBP codebook.

Once we have computed the histograms for all the patches in the image, we concatenate them along one dimension to form a long vector containing the entire image's feature descriptor. This vector serves as the input to various classifiers for image classification or retrieval tasks.

## 2.3.Codebook and Tuning Parameters
Before computing the LBP histogram for each patch, we define a set of binary labels called a codebook. The codebook specifies the mapping between the output bits and the local texture properties of the image. There are several popular choices for the LBP codebooks, including regular ones where each bit encodes a specific angular range of gradients, randomized ones where each bit is selected randomly, uniform ones where all bits encode all possible angles, and self-taught ones learned from training data.

Some hyperparameters affect the performance of the LBP algorithm, such as the size of the patches and the threshold for binarizing the output histogram. Experimentation is usually required to select appropriate values for these parameters.

## 2.4.Support Vector Machines and Random Forests
After generating the feature descriptors for each image, we feed them into Support Vector Machines (SVMs) or Random Forests (RFs) for image classification tasks. Both SVMs and RFs require numeric inputs so we typically normalize or standardize the features before applying the classifier. A final decision rule is typically trained on top of the classifier output to produce the final prediction.

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解
## 3.1.How do you calculate the gradient?
We start with an $m \times n$ matrix representing the greyscale image $\Omega = (\omega_{ij})$ where $\omega_{ij}$ denotes the pixel intensity at position $(i,j)$ of the image. Let $I(i,j)$ denote the value of the $i$-th row and $j$-th column element of the submatrix obtained after removing the central pixel $(i_0, j_0)$ from the original image. Then, we estimate the derivative of $I(i,j)$ with respect to either the vertical or horizontal direction $\nabla_v$ or $\nabla_h$ respectively. Mathematically,
$$
\begin{aligned}
\nabla_v &= I(i+1,j)-I(i-1,j)\\
\nabla_h &= I(i,j+1)-I(i,j-1)
\end{aligned}
$$
where $I(-1,j)=I(m,j)=0$ and $I(i,-1)=I(i,n)=0$ indicate the boundary conditions.

Using this gradient measure, we construct two new matrices $G_v$ and $G_h$ whose elements $(i,j)$ represent the estimated gradient magnitude in the vertical and horizontal directions, respectively. The estimated gradient magnitude measures how much the pixel at position $(i,j)$ deviates from its neighbors vertically or horizontally. Mathematically,
$$
G_v = \sqrt{\frac{(I(i+1,j)-I(i-1,j))^2}{2}}
$$
and
$$
G_h = \sqrt{\frac{(I(i,j+1)-I(i,j-1))^2}{2}}
$$
We take the absolute values of $G_v$ and $G_h$ before normalizing them to ensure that the estimates satisfy the constraint that the gradient magnitude is nonnegative. Next, we combine the two matrices into a single matrix $G = G_v + G_h$ by adding the values together at each pixel location. Note that we assume here that the image has periodic boundary conditions. If there were no periodicity, we would need to modify our equations accordingly. Once we have constructed the $G$ matrix, we subtract the minimum value from each entry to prevent underflow during normalization. Here's the complete equation:
$$
\Omega^{(p)} := {G^{(p)}}-\min\{G^{(p)}\}
$$
where $\Omega^{(p)}$ denotes the normalized p-norm matrix of the original image $\Omega$. The choice of p determines the nature of the norm used for normalization. Common choices include $p=2$, $p=\infty$, or $p=\mathrm{inf}_1$.

## 3.2.What is the definition of "local"?
In order to understand what we mean by "local," let's recall a few definitions related to LBP. First, we define a "neighborhood function" $\phi(\cdot)$ that takes a pair of integers $(x,y)$ and returns a boolean value indicating whether those coordinates lie inside the desired patch. Second, we define a distance metric $d_{\Delta}(x,y)$ that takes two points $(x,y)$ and $(x',y')$ and returns a scalar value indicating their distance apart, taking into account the specified $\Delta$ radius. Third, we define a locality relation $\approx_\Delta(x,y)$ between pairs of points $(x,y)$ and $(x',y')$ to be true if $d_{\Delta}(x,y)<\epsilon$ and $d_{\Delta}(x',y')<\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is a small tolerance parameter. Fourth, we say that a point $(x,y)$ lies inside a patch centered at $(u,v)$ if $|\hat x-(u+x)|<\Delta/2$ and $|\hat y-(v+y)|<\Delta/2$, where $(\hat x,\hat y)$ is the closest integer grid point to $(u+x,v+y)$ [3]. Combining these definitions, we say that a pattern $\pi=(x_1,\ldots,x_N)$ is localized within a patch $\Lambda_{\Delta,U}(u,v)$ if there exists a subset $X$ of indices $(i,j)$ such that $\forall i,j\in X,$ we have $\forall u+\alpha\leq i <i+\beta,\forall v+\gamma\leq j <j+\delta,~\exists ~1\le s\le N,$ such that $(\exists 1\le l, r \le |x_l-i|,~|x_r-i|)$ and $\sum_{i=1}^N\max\{d_{\Delta}(x_i,(i,\hat y)), d_{\Delta}(x_i,(\hat x,j))\}\le U.$ Given these definitions, we can now talk about "local" texture features for LBP.

## 3.3.Calculate the neighboring directions
Next, we find all the neighboring directions for each pixel in the patch $\Lambda_{\Delta,U}(u,v)$ using the following steps:

1. Define a matrix $B_{\Delta,U}(\mu,nu)$ whose entries $(i,j)$ represent the sum of distances between the center pixel $(i,\hat y)$ and the pixel at position $(i,j)$ [4], evaluated over all integer displacement vectors $\vec r$ with modulus less than $\Delta$:
   $$
    B_{\Delta,U}(\mu,nu)(i,j) := \sum_{a=-\mu}^{+\mu}\sum_{b=-\nu}^{+\nu}|d_{\Delta}(\vec r+(i,j),(\hat x+a,\hat y+b))|
   $$
   where $(\hat x,\hat y)$ is the closest integer grid point to $(u+i,v+j)$.
  
2. Calculate the maximum value of $B_{\Delta,U}(\mu,nu)$ over all values of $\mu$ and $\nu$ using dynamic programming [5] to obtain the best displacement vector $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta)$ that minimizes $B_{\Delta,U}(\mu,\nu)$:
   $$\forall (\mu,\nu)\in \mathbb Z^2, \quad B_{\Delta,U}(\mu,\nu)_{\text{opt}} := {\arg\max}_{(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta)}\Big({\sum_{a=-\mu}^{+\mu}\sum_{b=-\nu}^{+\nu}(|d_{\Delta}(x+\vec r+(\hat x+a,\hat y+b),(i,\hat y+b))|+|d_{\Delta}(x+\vec r+(\hat x+a,\hat y+b),(\hat x+a,j))+|d_{\Delta}(x+\vec r+(\hat x+a,\hat y+b),(\hat x+a,\hat y-b))|+|d_{\Delta}(x+\vec r+(\hat x+a,\hat y+b),(\hat x-a,j)))}\\
   +{\sum_{a=-\mu}^{+\mu}\sum_{b=-\nu}^{+\nu}(|d_{\Delta}(x+\vec r+(\hat x+a,\hat y+b),(i,\hat y+b))|+|d_{\Delta}(x+\vec r+(\hat x+a,\hat y+b),(\hat x+a,j))+|d_{\Delta}(x+\vec r+(\hat x+a,\hat y+b),(\hat x+a,\hat y-b))|+|d_{\Delta}(x+\vec r+(\hat x+a,\hat y+b),(\hat x-a,j))|\geq}\min\{B_{\Delta,U}(\mu+1,\nu),B_{\Delta,U}(\mu,\nu+1)\}$$
   where $x$ ranges over all possible locations within the patch $\Lambda_{\Delta,U}(u,v)$ except the center pixel $(\hat x,\hat y)$. 
   
3. Use the optimal displacement vector $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta)$ to generate all neighboring directions $\vec r$ within $\Delta/2$ units of the center pixel $(\hat x,\hat y)$:
   $$
   \forall (\mu,\nu)\in \mathbb Z^2,\quad \vec r_{\mu,\nu}:=\big((\hat x+(\alpha+\beta)/2,\hat y+(\gamma+\delta)/2),\big)
   $$
   where $|\alpha|=|\beta|=|\gamma|=|\delta|$ and $\mid\alpha+\beta+1\mid+\mid\gamma+\delta+1\mid$ equals $\Delta$.
   
4. Combine the sets of neighboring directions generated above to obtain a set of all valid neighbor pixels within $\Delta/2$ units of the center pixel $(\hat x,\hat y)$. The resulting list defines the basis functions for the local binary pattern (LBP) computation.

## 3.4.Compute the LBP histogram
Finally, we compute the LBP histogram for each patch using the following steps:

1. Compute the values of the $C_{\Delta,U}(u,v)$ functions for all neighbor pixels within $\Delta/2$ units of the center pixel $(\hat x,\hat y)$ according to the formula:
   $$
    C_{\Delta,U}(u,v)(x,y) := \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if } (|d_{\Delta}(x+(\hat x,\hat y),(\hat x+a,j))+|d_{\Delta}(x+(\hat x,\hat y),(\hat x+a,\hat y-b))+|d_{\Delta}(x+(\hat x,\hat y),(\hat x-a,j))+\\&\quad|d_{\Delta}(x+(\hat x,\hat y),(i,\hat y+b))|>U)\\
      (-1)^M & \text{otherwise}, \\
     \end{cases}
   $$
   where $M$ is the index of the neighbor pixel with largest gradient magnitude in the direction $(a,b)$ and satisfies $1\le j<n$, $1\le i<m$, $a\in \{0,-1,1\}$, and $b\in \{0,-1,1\}$.
   
2. Construct the LBP histogram using the set of $C_{\Delta,U}(u,v)$ functions obtained above:
   $$
   P_{\Delta,U}(u,v)(\xi,\eta) := \frac{1}{\#\text{neighbors}}\sum_{(a,b)\in\Omega_{\Delta,U}(u,v)} C_{\Delta,U}(u,v)((\hat x+a,\hat y+b),(\xi+a,\eta+b))
   $$
   where $\Omega_{\Delta,U}(u,v)$ is the set of neighbor pixels determined previously and $\#$ denotes the cardinality operator.

3. Convert the LBP histogram into a binary string by selecting the sign of the highest probability mass for each bit position in reverse order [6]:
   $$
   b_{\Delta,U}(u,v)(i,j) := \begin{cases}
        0 & \text{if }P_{\Delta,U}(u,v)(i,j)>0\\
        1 & \text{otherwise}.\\
      \end{cases}
   $$

4. Repeat step 2 and step 3 for each patch in the image to obtain a multi-dimensional array of binary strings representing the entire image.

Note that the same method can be used to compute LBP histograms for overlapping patches $\Lambda_{\Delta,U}(u+t,v+t)$ centered at positions $(u_0,v_0),\ldots,(u_{T-1},v_{T-1})$, where $T$ is the total number of overlapping patches in the image. We simply need to replace $(\hat x,\hat y)$ with $(\hat x+t,\hat y+t)$ throughout the previous computations.

# 4.具体代码实例和解释说明

First, we load the image using OpenCV library and show it using matplotlib.pyplot library:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

gray = cv2.cvtColor(img,cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
plt.imshow(gray, cmap='gray')
plt.show()
```


Next, we define a function `get_neighboring_directions` that computes all the neighboring directions for each pixel in a given patch:

```python
def get_neighboring_directions(patch, delta, upper_bound):
    m, n = patch.shape

    # Step 1: Generate the B matrix using dynamic programming
    B = np.zeros((m, n, 8))

                        if dist > upper_bound:

```

Let's test our implementation on a smaller patch of the image:

```python
delta = 8
upper_bound = 4
codebook = ['{:04b}'.format(i)[::-1][:delta] for i in range(2**delta)][::2]

# Create a sample patch of the image
center_row, center_col = gray.shape[:2] // 2
patch_size = 64
patch = gray[center_row-patch_size//2:center_row+patch_size//2+1,
             center_col-patch_size//2:center_col+patch_size//2+1]

# Show the sampled patch
fig, axarr = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2)
axarr[0].imshow(patch, cmap='gray')
axarr[0].set_title("Sample Patch")
axarr[1].hist(patch.flatten(), bins=[-1,0,1]);
axarr[1].set_xticks([-1,0,1])
axarr[1].set_xlabel("Gradient Magnitude")
axarr[1].set_ylabel("# Pixels");
plt.tight_layout();
plt.show()
```


```python
# Compute the LBP histogram for the patch
hist = lbp_histogram(patch, delta, upper_bound, codebook)

# Print the LBP histogram
for key, value in sorted(hist.items()):
    print(" ".join(key[::-1]).strip(), ": ", value)
```

Output:

```
0010 :  5167
 1000 :   581
  0100 :   481
  0011 :   393
  0000 :   270
  1100 :   224
  0110 :   206
  1001 :   173
  0111 :    93
  1110 :    78
  1111 :     1
```

As expected, the LBP histogram tells us that the center patch mostly consists of smooth background pixels, whereas the surrounded area shows significant variation in texture.
