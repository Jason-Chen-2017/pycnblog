# 2. Basic Concepts & Terms Explanation
Before going deep into the React Native Navigation library, let's first understand some basics terms and concepts that are essential to get started with this library. Here we will cover these points in detail:

1. History background: What is React Native Navigation all about? When was it created? Who is behind it? Why did they choose such an architecture for navigation? 

2. Page switch mode: How does React Native Navigation handle page switching between screens or views? Different modes like Stack, Tab, Screen, Modal etc., how they work internally and what advantages they provide over other approaches? 

3. Data passing between pages: Can you pass data from one screen to another using React Native Navigation? If yes, how can you do so? If no, why not? 

4. Header customization: Can you customize header on different screens in your app using React Native Navigation? If yes, how to achieve it? If no, why not? 

5. Bottom tab bar: Is there a bottom tab bar available with React Native Navigation by default? If yes, what advantages it provides compared to other libraries/frameworks? If no, why not? 

Let's dive deeper into each point below...

## 2.1 History Background
React Native Navigation (RNN) was developed by Wix.io back in 2017 as a response to the lack of robust navigation solutions for React Native apps. It had strong focus on performance, scalability, developer experience, and ease-of-use while providing features like nested stacks, shared element transitions, overlay navigators, and more. The company quickly embraced RNN as their primary navigation framework and built many successful products around it including several popular react native starter kits that used it out-of-the box. However, their decision to discontinue its development lead to fragmentation amongst the community and multiple forks leading to confusion for developers who try to decide which version to use. Eventually, Facebook launched Navigator which revolutionized navigation in React Native, but it still requires significant changes to existing codebase. The need for a dedicated and comprehensive solution led to the birth of React Native Navigation.

The core team at Wix.io has been working closely with developers and product teams throughout the years and has worked towards building a highly efficient and feature rich navigation framework. They continue to invest heavily in making the library better every day. They have released several versions of the library with major improvements and new features continuously. Today, the company is focused on developing the next generation of the library with improved API design and performance. The latest stable release is v4.x and the upcoming release is already underway.

## 2.2 Page Switch Mode
When it comes to selecting the appropriate page switch mode for your application, React Native Navigation provides three types of navigation models namely Stack, Tab, and Screen. Let's take a closer look at each of them individually.

### 2.2.1 Stack
In the stack model, when you navigate from one screen to another, the previous screen remains visible underneath until you go back to it. This means that only one screen is shown at any given time, creating a sense of immersiveness and enhancing user experience. You can easily implement this model by pushing and popping screens onto a stack managed by the navigator object. For example:

```javascript
  this.props.navigation.push('OtherScreen'); // To push OtherScreen onto current stack

  this.props.navigation.pop(); // To pop the topmost screen off the stack

  this.props.navigation.popToTop(); // To pop all the screens except the root screen
```


Pros:
* Easier for users to navigate
* Doesn't require users to remember where they were before
* Great for browsing content without context switching

Cons:
* Requires too much memory if users keep visiting new screens repeatedly
* Can become cluttered with multiple screens open at once

### 2.2.2 Tab
In the tab model, all the tabs are visible together at the same time allowing users to view various options simultaneously. Tabs allow you to divide your app into separate sections or functionalities that are easier to access than traditional menu structures. For example, in Instagram, the home feed, notifications, profile, and settings tabs are present on every screen. Each tab contains specific sets of information related to its purpose. In RNN, you can easily create tabs by defining routes and specifying which screens should be rendered in each route. For example:

```jsx
  <Tab.Navigator>
    <Tab.Screen name="Home" component={Home} />
    <Tab.Screen name="Notifications" component={Notifications} />
    <Tab.Screen name="Profile" component={Profile} />
    <Tab.Screen name="Settings" component={Settings} />
  </Tab.Navigator>
```


Pros:
* Enables easy exploration of complex functionality
* Fewer clicks required to reach certain parts of the app
* Better organization for large applications

Cons:
* Not suitable for longer forms or forms requiring scrolling
* May cause confusion due to excessive screen real estate taken up by tabs

### 2.2.3 Screen
The screen model allows you to display a single screen at a time with no possibility of interruption. The screen displayed stays static and unaffected by any interaction happening elsewhere in the app. While this might seem limiting initially, it enables very high degree of control and flexibility in managing the UI of your app. Additionally, this approach often simplifies navigation logic as well as reducing boilerplate code. For example:

```jsx
  class HomeScreen extends Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
          <Text>Welcome to my App</Text>
          {/* buttons for navigating to other screens */}
        </View>
      );
    }
  }
  
  export default function(props) {
    const { navigation } = props;
    return (
      <SafeAreaView style={{flex: 1}}>
        <HomeScreen {...props} />
      </SafeAreaView>
    )
  }
```


Pros:
* Provides smooth and seamless transition between screens
* Easy to manage state and lifecycle of individual screens

Cons:
* Single-page design limits possibilities for complex navigation patterns
* Harder to explore different areas of the app

Overall, depending on your requirements and design constraints, choosing the right type of navigation pattern could significantly impact usability, navigation flow, and overall quality of the final product.

## 2.3 Data Passing Between Pages
In order to enable communication between two or more screens, you can simply pass props down from parent components to child components using React Native Navigation. This mechanism works both ways - you can also send data back up to parent components if needed. For example:

```jsx
  import React, { useState } from'react';
  import { View, TextInput, Button, SafeAreaView } from'react-native';
  import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
  import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';
  
  function DetailsScreen({ route }) {
    const [text, setText] = useState('');
  
    return (
      <SafeAreaView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
        <TextInput value={text} onChangeText={(t) => setText(t)} />
        <Button title='Go Back' onPress={() => route.params?.onGoBack()} />
      </SafeAreaView>
    );
  }
  
  function MainScreen() {
    const Stack = createStackNavigator();
    
    return (
      <NavigationContainer>
        <Stack.Navigator initialRouteName='Details'>
          <Stack.Screen
            name='Details'
            component={DetailsScreen}
            options={{
              title: 'Details',
              headerStyle: {
                backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
              },
              headerTitleStyle: {
                fontWeight: 'bold',
              },
            }}
          />
  
          <Stack.Screen
            name='OtherScreen'
            component={DetailsScreen}
            options={{
              title: 'Other Screen',
              headerStyle: {
                backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
              },
              headerTitleStyle: {
                fontWeight: 'bold',
              },
            }}
            listeners={{
              /* Listen for event emitted from DetailsScreen */
              hardwareBackPress: e => {
                console.log('hardware back press triggered!');
                e.preventDefault(); // Prevents default behavior i.e. exiting app completely
                
                /* Call custom handler passed through params */
                const { onGoBack } = route.params || {};
                if (typeof onGoBack === 'function') {
                  onGoBack();
                }
                
                return true;
              },
            }}
          />
        </Stack.Navigator>
      </NavigationContainer>
    );
  }
  
  export default MainScreen;
```

Here, `DetailsScreen` receives props named `route`. We use destructuring assignment to extract the route parameter from the prop object. The `onChangeText` method of `TextInput` component updates the text variable, which is then used to update the input field whenever changed. The `onGoBack` callback defined in the listener property of `MainScreen`'s `Stack.Screen` specifies a custom callback function that gets called when the back button is pressed on `DetailsScreen`. This callback function logs a message to the console and calls the provided `onGoBack` function. The latter is used to perform any clean up actions necessary before navigating away from the screen.

As mentioned earlier, this mechanism works both ways - you can also send data back up to parent components if needed. For example, you can modify the above example slightly to include a "Submit" button alongside the "Go Back" button in `DetailsScreen`, and receive the entered text data back up to `MainScreen`:

```jsx
  import React, { useState } from'react';
  import { View, TextInput, Button, SafeAreaView } from'react-native';
  import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
  import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';
  
  function DetailsScreen({ route, navigation }) {
    const [text, setText] = useState('');
  
    async function onSubmit() {
      await fetch(`http://example.com/${text}`);
      
      /* Navigate back to MainScreen */
      navigation.goBack();
    }
  
    return (
      <SafeAreaView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
        <TextInput value={text} onChangeText={(t) => setText(t)} />
        <Button title='Submit' onPress={onSubmit} />
        <Button title='Go Back' onPress={() => route.params?.onGoBack()} />
      </SafeAreaView>
    );
  }
  
  function MainScreen() {
    const Stack = createStackNavigator();
    
    return (
      <NavigationContainer>
        <Stack.Navigator initialRouteName='Details'>
          <Stack.Screen
            name='Details'
            component={DetailsScreen}
            options={{
              title: 'Details',
              headerStyle: {
                backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
              },
              headerTitleStyle: {
                fontWeight: 'bold',
              },
            }}
          />
  
          <Stack.Screen
            name='OtherScreen'
            component={DetailsScreen}
            options={{
              title: 'Other Screen',
              headerStyle: {
                backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
              },
              headerTitleStyle: {
                fontWeight: 'bold',
              },
            }}
            listeners={{
              hardwareBackPress: e => {
                console.log('hardware back press triggered!');
                e.preventDefault(); // Prevents default behavior i.e. exiting app completely
                
                const { onGoBack } = route.params || {};
                if (typeof onGoBack === 'function') {
                  onGoBack();
                }
                
                return true;
              },
            }}
          />
        </Stack.Navigator>
      </NavigationContainer>
    );
  }
  
  export default MainScreen;
```

Now, the "Submit" button sends a POST request to an external server with the entered text data, and then navigates back to the previous screen using `navigation.goBack()`. You may want to add additional error handling and messaging here based on the success or failure of the API call.
