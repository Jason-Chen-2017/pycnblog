## 4. Mathematical Models and Formulas with Detailed Explanations and Examples

In this section, we will delve into the mathematical models and formulas that underpin the core operations of basic models. These mathematical foundations are essential for understanding how models are trained and optimized. We will use LaTeX to present the formulas and provide step-by-step explanations and examples to clarify their applications.

### 4.1. Activation Functions

Activation functions introduce non-linearities into the model, allowing it to learn complex patterns. The most commonly used activation functions include ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh.

**ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):**

$$
\text{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x)
$$

**Sigmoid:**

$$
\text{Sigmoid}(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
$$

**Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent):**

$$
\text{Tanh}(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}}
$$

#### Example: ReLU Function

Let's consider an example where we apply the ReLU function to a simple input vector $\mathbf{x} = [-2, -1, 3, 5]$.

$$
\text{ReLU}(\mathbf{x}) = \max(0, [-2, -1, 3, 5]) = [0, 0, 3, 5]
$$

### 4.2. Loss Functions

Loss functions measure the discrepancy between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs. Common loss functions include Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cross-Entropy Loss.

**Mean Squared Error (MSE):**

$$
\text{MSE}(\mathbf{y}, \hat{\mathbf{y}}) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2
$$

where $\mathbf{y}$ is the ground truth output, $\hat{\mathbf{y}}$ is the predicted output, and $m$ is the number of samples.

**Cross-Entropy Loss:**

$$
\text{Cross-Entropy Loss}(\mathbf{y}, \hat{\mathbf{y}}) = -\sum_{i=1}^{m} y_i \log(\hat{y_i})
$$

where $y_i$ is the ground truth probability for the $i$-th class, and $\hat{y_i}$ is the predicted probability for the $i$-th class.

#### Example: MSE Loss

Consider a simple binary classification problem with two classes, where the ground truth labels $\mathbf{y} = [1, 0, 1, 0]$ and the predicted probabilities $\hat{\mathbf{y}} = [0.7, 0.2, 0.8, 0.1]$.

$$
\text{MSE}(\mathbf{y}, \hat{\mathbf{y}}) = \frac{1}{4} \left[ (1 - 0.7)^2 + (0 - 0.2)^2 + (1 - 0.8)^2 + (0 - 0.1)^2 \right] = 0.15
$$

### 4.3. Optimization Algorithms

Optimization algorithms are used to minimize the loss function by updating the model's weights. Common optimization algorithms include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam.

**Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):**

$$
w_{t+1} = w_t - \alpha \nabla_w J(w_t)
$$

where $w_t$ is the weight vector at time step $t$, $\alpha$ is the learning rate, and $\nabla_w J(w_t)$ is the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights.

**Adam Optimization Algorithm:**

$$
m_t = \beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_1) \nabla_w J(w_t) \\
v_t = \beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_2) (\nabla_w J(w_t))^2 \\
\hat{m_t} = \frac{m_t}{1 - \beta_1^t} \\
\hat{v_t} = \frac{v_t}{1 - \beta_2^t} \\
w_{t+1} = w_t - \alpha \frac{\hat{m_t}}{\sqrt{\hat{v_t}} + \epsilon}
$$

where $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are the exponential decay rates for the first and second moments, respectively, and $\epsilon$ is a small constant to prevent division by zero.

#### Example: Adam Optimization

Suppose we have the following gradients and hyperparameters:

$$
m_0 = [0.1, 0.2], \quad v_0 = [0.01, 0.02], \quad \beta_1 = 0.9, \quad \beta_2 = 0.99, \quad \alpha = 0.001, \quad \epsilon = 1e-8
$$

With the following new gradient:

$$
\nabla_w J(w_t) = [0.3, 0.4]
$$

Applying the Adam update rule, we get:

$$
m_1 = [0.9 \cdot 0.1 + (1 - 0.9) \cdot 0.3, 0.9 \cdot 0.2 + (1 - 0.9) \cdot 0.4] = [0.24, 0.34]
$$

$$
v_1 = [0.99 \cdot 0.01 + (1 - 0.99) \cdot (0.3)^2, 0.99 \cdot 0.02 + (1 - 0.99) \cdot (0.4)^2] = [0.0099, 0.0196]
$$

$$
\hat{m}_1 = \frac{[0.24, 0.34]}{1 - 0.9^1} = [0.24/0.1, 0.34/0.1] = [2.4, 3.4]
$$

$$
\hat{v}_1 = \frac{[0.0099, 0.0196]}{1 - 0.99^1} = [0.0099/0.01, 0.0196/0.01] = [0.99, 1.96]
$$

$$
w_1 = [0.001 \cdot \frac{2.4}{\sqrt{0.99} + 1e-8}, 0.001 \cdot \frac{3.4}{\sqrt{1.96} + 1e-8}] \approx [0.0024, 0.0034]
$$

$$

### 4.3. Optimization Algorithms

Optimization algorithms are used to minimize the loss function by updating the model's weights. Common optimization algorithms include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam.

**Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):**

$$
w_{t+1} = w_t - \alpha \nabla_w J(w_t)
$$

where $w_t$ is the weight vector at time step $t$, $\alpha$ is the learning rate, and $\nabla_w J(w_t)$ is the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights.

**Adam Optimization Algorithm:**

$$
m_t = \beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_1) \nabla_w J(w_t) \\
v_t = \beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_2) (\nabla_w J(w_t))^2 \\
\hat{m_t} = \frac{m_t}{1 - \beta_1^t} \\
\hat{v_t} = \frac{v_t}{1 - \beta_2^t} \\
w_{t+1} = w_t - \alpha \frac{\hat{m_t}}{\sqrt{\hat{v_t}} + \epsilon}
$$

where $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are the exponential decay rates for the first and second moments, respectively, and $\epsilon$ is a small constant to prevent division by zero.

#### Example: Adam Optimization

Suppose we have the following gradients and hyperparameters:

$$

With the following new gradient:

$$
\nabla_w J(w_t) = [0.3, 0.4]
$$

Applying the Adam update rule, we get:

$$
m_1 = [0.9 \cdot 0.1 + (1 - 0.9) \cdot 0.3, 0.9 \cdot 0.2 + (1 - 0.9) \cdot 0.4] = [0.24, 0.34]

$$

$$

   import tensorflow as tf
   import numpy as np
   import pandas as pd
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   ```
   The necessary libraries are imported for building and visualizing the neural network model.

2. **Load the Dataset:**
   ```python
   data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
   X = data.iloc[:, :-1].values
   y = data.iloc[:, -1].values
   ```
   The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, and the input features (X) and labels (y) are extracted. In this example, the dataset is assumed to have 28x28 pixel images as inputs and a single binary label as the output.

3. **Preprocess the Data:**
   ```python
   X = X / 255.0
   y = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y)
   ```
   The input images are normalized by dividing each pixel value by 255 to scale the pixel values between 0 and 1. This helps in stabilizing the learning process. The labels are one-hot encoded using the `to_categorical` function, which converts the binary labels into binary vectors, making it suitable for multi-class classification.

       tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
       tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')
   ])
   ```
   The neural network model is created using the `tf.keras.Sequential` class, which allows us to stack layers sequentially. The model consists of the following layers:
   - **Flatten Layer:** This layer flattens the 28x28 pixel images into 1D vectors, providing input to the subsequent dense layers.
   - **Dense Layer with 128 Units and ReLU Activation:** This dense layer has 128 units and uses the ReLU activation function to introduce non-linearity into the model.
   - **Dropout Layer with 20% Rate:** The dropout layer randomly sets a fraction of the input units to 0 at each training step, preventing overfitting.
   - **Dense Layer with 2 Units and Softmax Activation:** The final dense layer has 2 units and uses the softmax activation function to output probabilities for each class in the binary classification task.

6. **Compile the Model:**

   model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                 loss='categorical_crossentropy',
                 metrics=['accuracy'])
   ```
   The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, which is an adaptive learning rate optimizer. The `categorical_crossentropy` loss function is used for multi-class classification, and `accuracy` is the metric to evaluate the model's performance.

7. **Train the Model:**
   ```python
   model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.1)
   ```
   The model is trained using the `fit` method on the training data. The `epochs` parameter specifies the number of times the training data is passed through the model, and the `batch_size` parameter determines the number of samples processed before the model is updated. The `validation_split` parameter specifies the proportion of the training data to be used for validation during training.

8. **Evaluate the Model:**
   ```python
   loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
   print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
   ```
   The trained model is evaluated on the testing data using the `evaluate` method, which returns the loss and accuracy metrics. The accuracy of the model on the testing data is printed, providing insight into the model's performance on unseen data.

9. **Plot the Training History:**
   ```python
   plt.plot(model.history.history['accuracy'], label='Accuracy')
