Since the 1980s, the development of artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone several phases. Among these, neural networks, as one of the core technologies in AI, have achieved significant results in various fields such as image recognition, natural language processing, and game intelligence. However, why have neural networks become the foundation of AI? This requires an in-depth exploration of their background, core concepts, and algorithm principles.

Firstly, the origin of neural networks can be traced back to 1943, when psychologists McCulloch and mathematician Pitts proposed the neural network model. This model laid the foundation for neural network research and provided a direction for future studies. In the 1980s, the development of the backpropagation algorithm marked a breakthrough in the computational ability of neural networks, thereby enabling them to emerge in the field of AI.

Secondly, with the advancement of computer hardware and algorithm optimization, the computational power of neural networks has continued to increase. Especially in recent years, the rise of deep learning has demonstrated the strong capability of neural networks in handling complex tasks. Deep learning achieves this by stacking multiple layers of neural networks to automatically extract features from data, thereby achieving more precise predictions and classifications.

Lastly, the widespread application of neural networks is also attributed to the data-driven development model. Based on a large amount of data, neural networks can continuously learn and adjust to improve their accuracy and efficiency. This has made neural networks increasingly important in the field of AI.

## 1.1 神经网络的起源与发展历程

#### Origins and Development History of Neural Networks

神经网络的起源可以追溯到20世纪40年代，由心理学家McCulloch和数学家Pitts提出的神经网络模型。这一模型模拟了人类大脑神经元的工作原理，试图通过简单的数学模型来模拟人类的认知过程。然而，由于当时的计算能力限制，这一模型并没有得到广泛的应用。

直到20世纪80年代，反向传播算法（Backpropagation）的提出，使得神经网络在计算能力上取得了突破。反向传播算法通过反向传播误差，逐层更新网络权重，从而实现神经网络的训练。这一算法的提出，使得神经网络在图像识别、语音识别等领域取得了显著的成果。

进入21世纪，随着计算机硬件的快速发展，特别是GPU（图形处理单元）的出现，神经网络的计算能力得到了极大的提升。深度学习（Deep Learning）的兴起，使得神经网络的应用范围进一步扩大。深度学习通过多层神经网络的堆叠，可以自动提取数据中的特征，从而实现更加精准的预测和分类。

近年来，神经网络的不断发展还离不开数据驱动的发展模式。在大量数据的基础上，神经网络可以通过不断的学习和调整，逐渐提高其准确性和效率。例如，在自然语言处理领域，神经网络的应用使得机器翻译、情感分析等任务取得了显著的进展。

总体来说，神经网络的起源与发展历程，不仅体现了人工智能技术的进步，也展示了人类对大脑认知过程的不断探索。随着技术的不断进步，神经网络在未来将继续在人工智能领域发挥重要作用。

#### Origins and Development History of Neural Networks

The origin of neural networks can be traced back to the 1940s, when psychologists McCulloch and mathematician Pitts proposed the neural network model. This model simulated the working principles of human brain neurons, attempting to simulate human cognitive processes through simple mathematical models. However, due to the limitations of computational power at the time, this model did not gain widespread application.

It was not until the 1980s that the backpropagation algorithm was proposed, which marked a breakthrough in the computational ability of neural networks. The backpropagation algorithm updates the network weights by propagating errors backwards through the layers of the network, thus enabling the training of neural networks. This algorithm's proposal led to significant achievements in fields such as image recognition and speech recognition.

As the 21st century progressed, the rapid development of computer hardware, especially the advent of GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), greatly enhanced the computational power of neural networks. The rise of deep learning further expanded the scope of application of neural networks. Deep learning achieves this by stacking multiple layers of neural networks to automatically extract features from data, thereby achieving more precise predictions and classifications.

In recent years, the continuous development of neural networks is also closely related to the data-driven development model. Based on a large amount of data, neural networks can continuously learn and adjust to improve their accuracy and efficiency. For example, in the field of natural language processing, the application of neural networks has led to significant progress in tasks such as machine translation and sentiment analysis.

Overall, the origins and development history of neural networks not only reflect the progress of artificial intelligence technology but also demonstrate humanity's continuous exploration of the cognitive processes of the brain. With the advancement of technology, neural networks will continue to play an important role in the field of artificial intelligence.
