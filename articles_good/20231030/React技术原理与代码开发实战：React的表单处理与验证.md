# 1.背景介绍


Forms are an essential part of any web application or website that allow users to input data into the system for various purposes such as login, registration, purchase, etc. The most popular form validation libraries in the market today include jQuery Validation and React-Validation-Form. However, both these libraries have some limitations like they don’t handle asynchronous validations very well, they provide less control over styling, and there is no built-in support for server-side validation which can be a real challenge in larger applications with complex requirements. In this article we will look at how to implement basic form handling logic using React and also validate forms asynchronously and on the server side using Node.js and Express framework. We will use a sample codebase from scratch along with detailed explanations so that you get clear understanding about all the concepts involved in building robust forms in React apps.

# 2.核心概念与联系
In order to build robust forms in React apps, we need to understand the following fundamental principles:

1. Controlled components - Forms should always be handled by controlled components where the state is maintained within the component itself and not passed down through props.
2. Event handling - All user interactions (such as typing into text fields) in React apps must be handled using event handlers. This allows us to update our app's internal state based on changes in the UI. 
3. Validation rules - Form validation rules can vary depending on the type of information being captured, but typically, we need to ensure that required fields are filled out correctly before submitting the form. Also, we may want to enforce certain patterns or limits on the values entered by the user.
4. Asynchronous validation - When validating forms on the client side, we need to make sure it doesn't block the user from interacting with other parts of the UI while the validation is happening in the background. To achieve this, we can use techniques like debouncing, throttling, and memoization to reduce the number of requests sent to the server. On the server side, we need to perform proper validation checks and return appropriate error messages if necessary. 

Let's take a closer look at each one of these principles in more detail. 

1. Controlled components 
Controlled components are React elements whose value attribute is set directly by the parent component instead of coming from outside the component via props. For example, let's say we have a username input field inside a LoginForm component and we want to track its state internally in the component rather than passing it down through props. Here's how we can define it:

```jsx
class LoginForm extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      username: '',
    };
  }

  handleChange = (event) => {
    const { name, value } = event.target;

    this.setState({ [name]: value });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <input
          type="text"
          name="username"
          placeholder="Enter your username"
          value={this.state.username}
          onChange={this.handleChange}
        />

        {/* rest of the form */}
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

In the above code snippet, when the `onChange` event happens on the `<input>` element, the `handleChange` method gets called with an event object. We then extract the new value of the input field using destructuring assignment and call the `setState()` method to update the state of the component. Note that we're setting the `value` prop of the input element to the current value of the state variable. This way, whenever the state changes, the rendered input element will automatically reflect the latest value. 

2. Event handling
All user interaction in React apps involves event handling. It includes things like clicking buttons, hovering over links, and navigating between pages. The way we handle events in React relies heavily on functional programming paradigms like immutability and higher-order functions. Let's consider an example where we have two input fields and we want to show an alert message whenever either of them loses focus without entering any valid input:


```jsx
import React, { useState } from'react';

function Example() {
  const [valueA, setValueA] = useState('');
  const [valueB, setValueB] = useState('');

  function handleChangeA(event) {
    setValueA(event.target.value);
  }

  function handleChangeB(event) {
    setValueB(event.target.value);
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    // Check if either field has been modified
    if (!isValidInput(valueA)) {
      window.alert('Please enter a valid input for Field A.');
    } else if (!isValidInput(valueB)) {
      window.alert('Please enter a valid input for Field B.');
    }
  }, [valueA, valueB]);

  function isValidInput(value) {
    // Implement validation rules here...
  }
  
  return (
    <>
      <label htmlFor="field-a">Field A:</label>
      <input id="field-a" type="text" value={valueA} onChange={handleChangeA} />

      <label htmlFor="field-b">Field B:</label>
      <input id="field-b" type="text" value={valueB} onChange={handleChangeB} />
    </>
  );
}
```

In the above code snippet, we start by defining two input fields, "Field A" and "Field B". Each field has its own change handler function (`handleChangeA`, `handleChangeB`) that updates their corresponding state variables (`valueA`, `valueB`). We then add an effect hook that listens to both state variables and displays an alert message whenever either field loses focus without entering any valid input. Finally, we wrap everything up inside a single component (`Example`) and export it. 

Note that we're using hooks (`useState` and `useEffect`) to manage the state of the inputs and display the alerts. These hooks work closely with functional components and do not require any class components. 

3. Validation rules
To properly validate forms in React, we need to create reusable validation functions that accept specific input values and output true/false indicating whether the input is valid or invalid respectively. Let's assume that we have a sign-up form with three required fields: Name, Email, and Password. We'll write simple validation functions for each field below:

```javascript
// Validate Name field
const isValidName = (name) => {
  // Check if name contains only letters
  return /^[A-Za-z ]+$/.test(name);
};

// Validate Email field
const isValidEmail = (email) => {
  // Check if email is valid format
  return /\S+@\S+\.\S+/.test(email);
};

// Validate Password field
const isValidPassword = (password) => {
  // Check if password meets minimum length requirement
  return password.length >= 8;
};
```

We can now use these functions inside our form component to check whether each field is valid or not before allowing the user to submit the form:

```jsx
class SignUpForm extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      name: '',
      email: '',
      password: '',
    };
  }

  handleChange = (event) => {
    const { name, value } = event.target;

    this.setState({ [name]: value });
  };

  handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    
    // Get values from state
    const { name, email, password } = this.state;

    // Perform validation checks
    if (!isValidName(name)) {
      console.error(`Invalid name: ${name}`);
      return;
    }

    if (!isValidEmail(email)) {
      console.error(`Invalid email: ${email}`);
      return;
    }

    if (!isValidPassword(password)) {
      console.error(`Invalid password: ${password}`);
      return;
    }

    // Submit form data to server
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <div>
          <label htmlFor="name">Name*</label>
          <input
            type="text"
            id="name"
            name="name"
            value={this.state.name}
            onChange={this.handleChange}
          />
        </div>

        <div>
          <label htmlFor="email">Email*</label>
          <input
            type="email"
            id="email"
            name="email"
            value={this.state.email}
            onChange={this.handleChange}
          />
        </div>

        <div>
          <label htmlFor="password">Password*</label>
          <input
            type="password"
            id="password"
            name="password"
            value={this.state.password}
            onChange={this.handleChange}
          />
        </div>

        {/* rest of the form */}
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

In the above code snippet, we added the `required` HTML attribute to mark each field as mandatory before submission. We then defined separate methods for each validation rule (`isValidName`, `isValidEmail`, `isValidPassword`) that returns `true` if the input is valid and `false` otherwise. We've used regular expressions to check for the validity of the name, email, and password formats. If any of the fields fail any of the validation checks, we log an error message to the console and prevent the form from submitting. Otherwise, we submit the form data to the server. 

4. Asynchronous validation
As mentioned earlier, validating forms on the client side can become cumbersome when there are multiple fields and slow network connections. One way to address this issue is to move the validation process off the main thread, thus avoiding blocking the user interface during the validation process. There are several techniques available to accomplish this task including debouncing, throttling, and memoization. 

Debouncing is a technique that delays invoking a function until a specified amount of time has elapsed since the last time it was invoked. For example, let's say we have an expensive operation that takes five seconds to complete and we want to limit the number of times it gets executed in a given time frame (e.g., once every two seconds). With debounce, we would wait for two seconds after the first invocation before executing the expensive function again, effectively limiting the execution frequency to twice per second. Debounced functions can help improve performance by reducing the load on the CPU and I/O devices.

Here's an example implementation of a debounced function in JavaScript:

```javascript
function debounce(func, wait) {
  let timeoutId;
  
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => func(...args), wait);
  };
}
```

Throttling, on the other hand, is a technique that prevents a function from being called more than once within a specified interval. For example, let's say we have an API endpoint that returns a random integer every few seconds. Throttled functions can help protect against abuse by ensuring that the response is received at least every minute even if the request arrives more frequently. Here's an example implementation of a throttled function in JavaScript:

```javascript
function throttle(func, delay) {
  let previous = Date.now();
  
  return (...args) => {
    const now = Date.now();
    
    if (now - previous > delay) {
      func(...args);
      previous = now;
    }
  };
}
```

Memoization, also known as caching, is a technique that stores the result of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again. Memoized functions usually take longer to execute initially because they need to compute their results the first time they're called, but subsequent invocations can be significantly faster due to the stored cache. Here's an example implementation of a memoized function in JavaScript:

```javascript
function memoize(func) {
  const cache = {};
  
  return (...args) => {
    if (!cache[args]) {
      cache[args] = func(...args);
    }
    
    return cache[args];
  };
}
```

Using these techniques, we can optimize the form validation process by reducing the number of HTTP requests made and improving responsiveness to user actions. Additionally, by keeping the validation logic isolated in helper functions, we can easily reuse them across different form components without duplicating code.
