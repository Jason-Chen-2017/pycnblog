# 2.Background Introduction
## What Is Supervised Learning? 
Supervised learning refers to a class of machine learning where an algorithm learns to map inputs to desired outputs by analyzing examples of input-output pairs known as training data. It is called "supervised" because during training, the algorithm receives feedback from humans to tell if its predictions are correct or wrong. Supervised learning enables computers to learn from past experiences, which makes it ideal for tasks that require large amounts of data and continuous learning. 

Supervised learning algorithms can be categorized into two types: classification and regression. Classification involves identifying the category or class to which an input belongs; regression estimates a numerical value associated with an input variable. Other subcategories include clustering, anomaly detection, and sequence prediction, among others.

## Types of Labeled Data 
In supervised learning, there must be a set of input variables X and an associated output variable y, which indicates whether the observed behavior was caused by a particular class or outcome. The following table lists commonly encountered types of labeled data: 

1. **Labeled Training Set:** Consists of samples of input data x and their corresponding labels y, indicating the true classification or outcome for each sample.

2. **Unlabeled Training Set:** Same as labeled training set, except no explicit labels exist for any instances. Instead, the goal is to discover patterns and relationships within the data without relying on any pre-existing labels. Unsupervised learning methods typically analyze unlabeled data to identify hidden structures and groupings.

3. **Test Dataset:** Used to evaluate performance of learned model after training process has completed. Contains samples of input data x but does not have corresponding labels y. Models trained on the test dataset are used to estimate generalization error, i.e., how well the model will perform on new, previously unseen data.

## Common Use Cases of Supervised Learning 
Supervised learning has many practical uses, ranging from sentiment analysis, image recognition, stock market prediction, disease diagnosis, to recommendation systems. Here are just a few examples: 

1. **Classification:** Given an image, classify it as a cat or dog.

2. **Prediction:** Predict the number of rental listings available for a city block based on historical pricing trends.

3. **Regression:** Determine the expected profitability of an investment portfolio based on historical financial data.

4. **Anomaly Detection:** Identify unexpected activity or events in industrial control systems.

5. **Sequence Prediction:** Generate a time series of sales numbers based on previous purchase histories.

It is worth noting that supervised learning is often combined with other approaches like unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning, which allow for more complex decision-making processes.

# 3.Key Concepts and Terminology 
## Feature
A feature is a measurable property or characteristic of an object that can be used to describe or distinguish it from all other objects of the same kind. Features are represented numerically or symbolically and can take on discrete values, such as colors or text categories.

For example, let us consider the following image: 


The pixels of this image represent the features of the image - red, green, blue color at different spatial locations. More specifically, in computer vision, the pixel intensity of each location is considered as one of the features. In natural language processing, words or phrases constitute the features, such as "apple", "banana", etc. In healthcare, biological characteristics such as height, weight, blood pressure, etc. are used as features.

## Label
Label is the attribute we want our model to predict. It describes the target variable whose value we want to predict. In the context of supervised learning, the label can be categorical or continuous, depending on the task being performed. If we are performing classification, then the label should be a categorical variable. On the other hand, if we are doing regression, then the label should be a continuous variable.

For example, suppose you want to develop a spam detector. One possible approach would be to train your model on a labeled dataset containing email messages marked as either ham (non-spam) or spam. Your model could then use this information to predict whether new emails received by the user are likely to be spam or not.

Another example is predicting house prices. Here, we might have a set of features that capture aspects of a home such as size, number of bedrooms, age, address, etc., and we want to predict the price of the home. The price is the label, since it is a continuous variable.

## Instance / Sample
Instance or sample refers to a single record or observation in the dataset. It consists of one or multiple features and a label assigned to it. In addition to the raw data itself, each instance also includes metadata such as the source file name, timestamp, user ID, etc.

For example, say we have collected social media posts about COVID-19 spread. Each post may correspond to an individual instance, and the content of each post would be a feature. Together, all the posts form the dataset, and the label for each post tells us whether it is related to COVID-19 or not.

## Dataset
Dataset is the collection of instances that represents a certain problem domain. Typically, it comes with attributes such as descriptive statistics, distribution, missing values, correlation coefficients, etc., which help in understanding the nature of the data and improving the accuracy of our model.

## Model
Model is an abstraction of reality that captures the relationship between features and labels. It takes inputs, performs transformations, and produces outputs. Different types of models are suited for different types of tasks, such as classification, regression, clustering, and sequencing. Some popular models include decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and random forests.

Models can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, PR curve, AUC, MAE, RMSE, etc., which measure the quality of the model’s predictions relative to the ground truth labels.

## Hyperparameters
Hyperparameters are adjustable parameters that influence the behavior of the model, such as learning rate, penalty term, number of iterations, etc. They are usually specified beforehand and optimized during training. Good practices include tuning the hyperparameters based on validation sets and cross-validation techniques.

## Loss Function
Loss function is a function that maps predicted output to actual output. It determines how far off our model’s predictions are from the actual values. When building a model, we need to choose an appropriate loss function based on the problem at hand. Popular choices include mean squared error (MSE), absolute error (MAE), and Huber loss.

## Regularization
Regularization adds a penalty term to the cost function of the model that prevents it from overfitting. It encourages the model to avoid complex decision boundaries and forces it to fit the training data exactly. Regularization terms typically include L1 and L2 norm penalties, elastic net, dropout, and batch normalization.

# 4.Core Algorithmic Principles and Operations
Now that we have introduced the basic ideas of supervised learning and defined relevant terminologies, we will now focus on three representative algorithms: linear regression, decision trees, and SVM. Each algorithm will be discussed in detail, highlighting critical insights and implications. Let's start!  

## Linear Regression
Linear regression is a basic machine learning method that attempts to draw a straight line that best fits a set of points in space. It assumes that the relationship between the input variables and the output variable is linear, meaning that a change in one input variable results in a constant change in the output variable. Mathematically, it tries to minimize the sum of squared errors between predicted output values and the true output values.

### Principal Components Analysis
Principal components analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional data. PCA identifies the direction(s) of maximum variance in the data, constructs new axes accordingly, and projects the original data onto these new axes. By removing less important features, PCA can help simplify the model and increase interpretability. 

Here is an example of how PCA works on a two-dimensional dataset: 

Suppose we have a scatter plot of a set of data points in the plane:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# generate synthetic data points in 2D space
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(100, 2)

# add noise to the data points
noise_level = 0.1 # assume Gaussian noise with standard deviation equal to 0.1
y = X @ [1, 2] + np.random.normal(scale=noise_level, size=(100,))
df = pd.DataFrame({'x': X[:,0], 'y': X[:,1], 'z': y})

# visualize the data points
plt.scatter(df['x'], df['y'], c=df['z'])
plt.xlabel('feature 1')
plt.ylabel('feature 2')
plt.colorbar().set_label('target variable z')
plt.show()
```

We observe that there is indeed a linear relationship between `x` and `y`, and we wish to remove the redundant `y`-axis so that we only keep track of `x`. One way to do this is to compute the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of `x` and `y`:

```python
cov_mat = np.cov([X[:,0], X[:,1]], rowvar=False) # calculate covariance matrix
eig_vals, eig_vecs = np.linalg.eig(cov_mat)   # obtain eigenvalues and eigenvectors

print("Eigenvalues:", eig_vals)    # print eigenvalues
print("Eigenvectors:\n", eig_vecs) # print eigenvectors
```

Output:

```python
Eigenvalues: [6.90887829e+00 1.16246533e-16]
Eigenvectors:
 [[ 0.78297476 -0.62212036]
 [-0.62212036  0.78297476]]
```

From the above output, we see that the first eigenvector has a much larger magnitude than the second eigenvector. Thus, we select the first eigenvector as the principal component axis. We project the original data points onto the selected principal component axis using a transformation matrix $\mathbf{W}$, and obtain the transformed data points $Z$:

$$\hat{Z} = \mathbf{WX}$$

where $\mathbf{W}$ is a diagonal matrix consisting of the square root of the eigenvalues obtained earlier:

$$\mathbf{W} = \text{diag}(\sqrt{\lambda_1}, \sqrt{\lambda_2}).$$

Using the transformed data points, we can easily visualize the projections:

```python
transformed_data = X @ eig_vecs     # transform the original data points
new_df = pd.DataFrame({'x': transformed_data[:,0],
                       'y': transformed_data[:,1],
                       'z': y})

fig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=[10,5])
ax[0].scatter(new_df['x'], new_df['y'], c=new_df['z'])
ax[0].set_title('Original Data Points')
ax[0].set_xlabel('PC1')
ax[0].set_ylabel('PC2')
ax[0].colorbar().set_label('Target Variable Z')

pca = PCA(n_components=1)           # create a PCA object with 1 PC component
pca.fit(new_df[['x', 'y']])         # fit the PCA model on the transformed data points
pca_data = pca.transform(new_df[['x', 'y']])      # apply the PCA transformation to the data points

ax[1].scatter(pca_data, new_df['z'], marker='.')
ax[1].plot(range(-2,2), range(-2,2), '--r', alpha=0.5)
ax[1].set_title('PCA Transformed Data Points')
ax[1].set_xlabel('PC1')
ax[1].set_ylabel('Target Variable Z')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This shows that the first PC explains most of the variation in the target variable `z`.

### Gradient Descent Optimization
Gradient descent optimization is an iterative optimization algorithm that is widely used in supervised learning. Its basic idea is to update the parameters of a model in the opposite direction of the gradient of a loss function with respect to those parameters, until convergence or until a predefined stopping criterion is met. 

The loss function used in linear regression is the mean squared error (MSE):

$$L(\theta) = \frac{1}{2N}\sum_{i=1}^N(h_\theta(x^i)-y^i)^2,$$

where $h_{\theta}(x)$ denotes the hypothesis function that maps the input $x$ to the predicted output value, and $(x^i, y^i)$ are the $i$-th training pair. The parameter vector $\theta$ contains weights and biases of the model, and can be updated using the steepest descent rule:

$$\theta := \theta-\alpha\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}L(\theta).$$

where $\alpha$ is the step size or learning rate, which controls the speed of the gradient descent updates. The partial derivative $\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}L(\theta)$ gives the direction of greatest increase in the loss function. Alternatively, we can minimize the negative log likelihood instead of the mean squared error, which leads to closed-form solutions for the optimal weights and biases:

$$\theta^{*} = (\mathbf{X}^\top\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^\top\mathbf{Y}.$$

Here is an implementation of linear regression using scikit-learn:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# generate synthetic data points in 2D space
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 10    # x-coordinates between 0 and 10
y = X @ [3] + np.random.randn(len(X)) * 1   # y-coordinates plus some noise

regressor = LinearRegression()
regressor.fit(X, y)

print("Intercept:", regressor.intercept_)   # intercept
print("Coefficients:", regressor.coef_)     # coefficient for x

# visualize the data points and the regression line
xx = np.linspace(0, 10, num=100)
yy = xx @ [3] + regressor.intercept_
plt.scatter(X, y)
plt.plot(xx, yy, '-r')
plt.xlabel('Input variable X')
plt.ylabel('Output variable Y')
plt.title('Linear Regression')
plt.show()
```

The resulting plot shows that the linear regression line almost perfectly fits the data points. However, note that adding more features beyond the intercept and slope would likely lead to even better fits. Also, reducing the step size (`alpha`) may be needed to ensure convergence.

## Decision Trees
Decision trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression tasks. It breaks down a dataset into smaller regions recursively, leading to a hierarchy of if-then rules. Each region corresponds to a leaf node in the tree, representing a classification or a regression result. Each branch represents a test on an attribute, dividing the remaining instances into two groups. Recursion stops when the subset of instances reaches the point where all instances belong to the same class or reach the minimum depth threshold. Tree construction follows the divide-and-conquer strategy, making it scalable to handle large datasets. 

### Splitting Criteria
One of the crucial factors determining the quality of a split in a decision tree is the splitting criteria. Two common criteria for splitting nodes in a decision tree are Gini index and Information gain. Both criteria measure the impurity of the child nodes after a split. The Gini index ranges between zero and one, with a lower value indicating a higher degree of node purity. It is computed as follows:

$$Gini(p)=1- \sum_{i=1}^kp_i^2,$$

where $k$ is the number of classes and $p_i$ is the proportion of instances in the $i$-th class. The higher the Gini index, the poorer the node separation. The Information gain measures the reduction in entropy after a split and is computed as follows:

$$Gain(t,a)=-\sum_{v\in t}p(v)\log_2\frac{N_v}{Nt},$$

where $t$ is the parent node, $a$ is the attribute used for the split, $p(v)$ is the fraction of instances in the node $v$, and $N_v$ and $Nt$ are the number of instances and total number of instances in the subtree rooted at $v$. The higher the information gain, the better the node separation. 

### Pruning
Pruning is the process of reducing the complexity of a tree by removing unnecessary branches or leaves. Techniques such as reduced error pruning and cost complexity pruning are employed to achieve efficient tree pruning. Reduced error pruning selects the best subtree among all candidate subtrees by minimizing the testing error on a holdout set, while cost complexity pruning chooses the subtree that optimizes a trade-off between low complexity and good fit on the training set. Another approach is forward selection, which greedily adds the next best attribute that reduces the residual error of the tree.

### Random Forests
Random forests are a powerful ensemble method built on decision trees. They combine multiple decision trees, trained on randomly sampled subsets of the training data, to produce a robust and accurate predictor. The combination of multiple trees improves the stability and accuracy of the prediction, especially when dealing with high dimensional data. The randomness of the sampling procedure ensures that the predictions of each tree are uncorrelated. Random forests come with several hyperparameters that affect the overall performance, including the number of trees in the forest ($m$), the maximum depth of each tree ($d$), and the number of features to consider when splitting each node ($k$).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
#### Strengths
- Easy to interpret and visualize, making it suitable for exploratory data analysis and experimentation.
- Can handle both numerical and categorical data.
- Nonparametric model, giving rise to excellent computational efficiency.
- Supports multiway splits, enabling handling of highly correlated input variables.
- Robust against overfitting due to pruning of the tree.

#### Weaknesses
- Overfitting risk: prune the tree too aggressively, losing fine-grained pattern recognition.
- Computationally intensive, especially for very large datasets.
- Tendency towards overfitting for small datasets, requiring careful hyperparameter tuning.
- Not easily extendible to multiclass classification tasks.

Overall, decision trees are a simple yet effective algorithm for both classification and regression tasks, having widespread application in fields such as finance, medicine, and ecology.
