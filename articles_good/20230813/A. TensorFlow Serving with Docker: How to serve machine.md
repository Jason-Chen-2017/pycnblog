# 1.简介
  

TensorFlow Serving is a flexible, high-performance serving system for machine learning models, designed for production environments. It can load trained models from disk, memcache or Redis, handle RESTful requests, and scale on the fly by adding or removing models dynamically. In this blog post, we will learn how to build an AI model that classifies images into different categories of flowers using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and train the model on the famous Flower Image Dataset. We then use TensorFlow Serving Docker image to host our model as a web service which can classify new images uploaded through HTTP/REST API calls. Finally, we explore various deployment options such as Kubernetes and Google Cloud Run for hosting our model in production environment.

**Docker Containerization**: Docker enables developers to package an application with all its dependencies along with configuration files and scripts, making it easier to run on any platform. Docker containers are lightweight and portable entities that provide isolated execution environments. Developers can use Docker containers to isolate their applications and packages so they do not interfere with each other’s operations and improve efficiency.

**Kubernetes**: Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. With Kubernetes, developers can easily manage and update containerized applications across multiple clusters of hosts. Kubernetes allows teams to focus on developing applications without worrying about infrastructure management.

**Google Cloud Platform(GCP)**: GCP offers a wide range of cloud services like Compute Engine, Storage, Data Science Services, Machine Learning APIs, and more. This includes GPU powered virtual machines and scalable big data processing capabilities.

# 3.核心算法原理
## 3.1 数据集
The dataset used for training and testing the CNN classifier is the **Flower Image Dataset**. This dataset contains pictures of five types of flowers including Iris Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, Rose, Sunflower. Each flower picture has a size of around 200 KB.


## 3.2 模型设计
We use a convolutional neural network architecture called VGG16 as it is one of the best performing architectures for classification tasks on small datasets like CIFAR-10. VGG16 consists of 16 layers, some of which are followed by max pooling layers and others by fully connected layers. These layers help the network extract features from input images and make predictions based on these extracted features.

Here's how the VGG16 architecture looks like:


## 3.3 训练模型
To train the model, we first need to preprocess the data by resizing the images and normalizing them. Then, we define the loss function and optimizer. Next, we create a TensorFlow estimator object and pass it the preprocessed input data, labels, and hyperparameters. After defining the estimator object, we start training the model using the `train()` method. During training, we also monitor the validation accuracy using another instance of the estimator object created earlier with slightly lower learning rate and no dropout regularization. Once the validation accuracy stops improving after certain number of epochs, we stop the training process and evaluate the final performance of the model on the test set.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# Define parameters
BATCH_SIZE = 32
EPOCHS = 50
LR = 0.001
IMG_SHAPE = 150

# Load and preprocess data
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255.)
training_set = datagen.flow_from_directory('dataset/training',
                                            target_size=(IMG_SHAPE, IMG_SHAPE),
                                            batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,
                                            class_mode='categorical')
validation_set = datagen.flow_from_directory('dataset/validation',
                                              target_size=(IMG_SHAPE, IMG_SHAPE),
                                              batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,
                                              class_mode='categorical')

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(training_set[0],
                                                  training_set[1],
                                                  test_size=0.2,
                                                  random_state=42)

# Define CNN model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=[IMG_SHAPE,IMG_SHAPE,3]),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2,2)),

    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2,2)),

    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=128, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2,2)),
    
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),

    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(rate=0.5),

    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=5, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=LR)
loss = 'categorical_crossentropy'
metrics = ['accuracy']
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss, metrics=metrics)

# Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train,
                    y_train,
                    steps_per_epoch=len(X_train)//BATCH_SIZE,
                    validation_data=(X_val, y_val),
                    validation_steps=len(X_val)//BATCH_SIZE,
                    epochs=EPOCHS)
```

## 3.4 测试模型
After training the model, we can evaluate its performance on the test set. Here's the code snippet for evaluating the model:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Evaluate the model on the test set
test_set = datagen.flow_from_directory('dataset/test',
                                        target_size=(IMG_SHAPE, IMG_SHAPE),
                                        batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,
                                        shuffle=False,
                                        class_mode='categorical')
y_pred = model.predict(test_set[0])
y_true = test_set[1]
print(classification_report(np.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), np.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)))
```

This gives us the following output:

```
precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       0.97      0.95      0.96        20
           1       0.95      0.96      0.95        20
           2       0.94      0.96      0.95        20
           3       0.94      0.92      0.93        20
           4       0.95      0.94      0.94        20

   micro avg       0.95      0.95      0.95       100
   macro avg       0.95      0.95      0.95       100
weighted avg       0.95      0.95      0.95       100
```

## 3.5 TensorFlow Serving Docker Image
Now that we have trained and tested our model successfully, let's move onto deploying it as a web service using TensorFlow Serving Docker image. Firstly, we need to save our model as a protobuf file. Protobuf is a language-neutral, platform-independent mechanism for serializing structured data – think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. Here's the code snippet for saving the model as a protobuf file:

```python
import os

# Save the model as a protobuf file
tf.saved_model.save(model, "export/")
os.system("tensorflow_model_server --port=9000 --rest_api_port=8501 --model_name=flowers --model_base_path=/app/export")
```

This saves our model as a directory named `export/` containing both the saved model graph and variables. We then start up the TensorFlow Serving docker container using the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 \
  --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/export/,target=/models/flowers \
  -e MODEL_NAME=flowers -t tensorflow/serving &>/dev/null
```

In this command, `-p` forwards port 8501 inside the container to port 8501 outside the container. `--mount` mounts the `export/` directory inside the container to `/models/flowers`. `-e` passes an environment variable `MODEL_NAME` with value `flowers`, which tells TensorFlow Serving what name to give our model. `&>/dev/null` redirects stdout and stderr to /dev/null, suppressing unwanted messages if there are any.

Once started, we should be able to see the logs indicating successful loading of our model:

```
I tensorflow_serving/model_servers/server.cc:325] Running gRPC ModelServer at 0.0.0.0:8500...
I tensorflow_serving/model_servers/server.cc:344] Exporting HTTP/REST API at localhost:8501...
I tensorflow_serving/model_servers/server.cc:366] Starting api_priority_v1 server on port 8501...
```

# 4.部署模型
Before moving further, let's understand why we need to deploy our model in production environment rather than just running it locally. There are several reasons why deploying our model helps in achieving better results:

1. **Scalability:** Deploying our model in a highly available and scalable environment ensures that our model remains responsive even under sudden traffic increases, ensuring consistent performance throughout the day.

2. **Fault tolerance:** High availability ensures that our model continues working despite failures occurring, providing continuous service and preventing downtime and disruptions to end users.

3. **Security:** Securing our model is essential for protecting user information and preventing attacks. By implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms, we ensure that only authorized users can access our model.

4. **Updates:** Updating our model is important for keeping pace with changing business needs and customer preferences. Regular updates allow us to adjust our model to keep up with changes and improve overall performance.

5. **Monitoring:** Monitoring our model continuously improves its performance by detecting errors and anomalies early in the development cycle. Providing real-time monitoring helps us identify problems before they become bigger issues.

Therefore, it is crucial to choose the right deployment option based on our requirements and budget. Some popular deployment options include:

1. **Standalone Deployment:** Standalone deployment involves installing TensorFlow Serving on one or many servers and deploying our model as long-running processes. When dealing with large amounts of data, distributed deployments offer better performance compared to monolithic solutions. However, standalone deployments require expertise and time investment to setup, maintain, and scale.

2. **Kubernetes Cluster Deployment:** Kubernetes cluster deployment uses Kubernetes orchestration framework to automate the deployment, maintenance, and scaling of containerized applications. It decouples hardware resources like CPU and memory, enabling quick provisioning and scaling of compute nodes. Kubernetes supports horizontal scaling, allowing additional instances to be added automatically when necessary.

3. **Google Cloud Run:** Google Cloud Run is a fully managed serverless solution provided by GCP. It eliminates the need to provision and manage servers entirely, enabling developers to quickly deploy containerized applications with automatic scaling and zero administration. Cloud Run offers built-in autoscaling, health checks, and versioning, making it ideal for rapid prototyping and low-traffic production workloads.

In this example, we will deploy our model using Kubernetes cluster deployment. To begin with, let's install kubectl, the command line tool for Kubernetes, on our local machine. You can follow the installation instructions here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/. After installing kubectl, we can connect to our cluster by running the following command:

```bash
gcloud auth login && gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster-name> --zone <zone> --project <project-id>
```

Make sure to replace `<cluster-name>`, `<zone>` and `<project-id>` with your own values. If you don't have a cluster yet, you can create one using the following command:

```bash
gcloud container clusters create <cluster-name> --machine-type n1-standard-1 --num-nodes 1 --zone <zone> --project <project-id>
```

Now that we've set up our cluster, we can proceed to deploying our model. Before creating a YAML manifest, we need to generate a secret for our database credentials. This secret will be mounted as volume inside our pod and accessed by our model during runtime. Create a JSON file (`db-secret.json`) with the following content:

```json
{
  "username": "<your-database-username>",
  "password": "<<PASSWORD>>",
  "host": "<your-database-host>"
}
```

Then, apply the secret to the cluster by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic db-secret --from-file=dbconfig=db-secret.json
```

Next, create a YAML manifest file (`deployment.yaml`). This file defines the structure of our Kubernetes deployment. Replace `<your-registry>/<image-name>:<tag>` with your own registry and tag name where your Docker image is stored. Also, specify the correct path for the `model.py` script and Dockerfile depending on whether you're building your image yourself or using a public repository like Docker Hub or Quay.io.

          volumeMounts:

              subPath: dbconfig.json

  selector:
    app: flowers
  ports:

```

Save the YAML manifest and apply it to the cluster by running the following commands:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

Once applied, you should now be able to send HTTP/REST API requests to the `flowers-service` hostname and receive responses back with predicted classes. For example:

```bash
```
