# 1.简介
         

         As Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) become increasingly important as technology advances, the use of computational linguistics techniques to develop systems that can understand human languages has never been more critical in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. In this article, we will explore how we can build a basic language model using TensorFlow library for generating text based on given inputs. We will also cover some common concepts such as n-grams, vocabulary size, sequence length, training data quality and preprocessing steps before building our language model. 
         
         # 2. Basic Concepts & Terminology
        ### Vocabulary Size: 
        The first thing we need to do is decide on the maximum number of words or symbols we want our language model to be able to recognize. This value is called the vocabulary size or V.
        
        ### N-Grams: 
        N-Grams are sequences of n tokens (words/symbols). For example, if n=2 then bigrams (sequences of two adjacent words) would be considered. Trigrams (sequences of three adjacent words), fourgrams (sequences of four adjacent words) etc. are other examples. A bigram consists of one word followed by another.
        
        ### Sequence Length: 
        The second concept related to language models is the sequence length. This determines how long each sentence or document should be when inputted into the language model. Longer sequence lengths result in better accuracy but longer run times while shorter sequence lengths may produce less accurate results but faster computation time.
        
        ### Training Data Quality: 
        To train our language model, we need large amounts of high quality textual data. Depending on the specific application, different datasets could be used. Some good sources of text data include web crawled documents, news articles, movie scripts, medical journals, reviews, etc. It's essential to make sure that these datasets have a mix of diverse and varied topics and content so that the language model learns patterns that apply across all domains.
        
        ### Preprocessing Steps: 
        Before starting the actual language model construction, there are several pre-processing steps involved. These include tokenization, removing stop words, stemming/lemmatization, punctuation removal, and case folding. Tokenization involves breaking up sentences or paragraphs into individual words or symbols. Stop words are those which occur very frequently within the English language like "the", "and" and "is". Removing them from the dataset can improve the overall performance of the language model since they don't add much information. Stemming and Lemmatization involve reducing words to their root form, making it easier to identify commonalities between words with similar meanings. Punctuation removal removes any irrelevant characters from the text including special characters, numbers, and whitespace. Finally, Case Folding converts all letters to lowercase to ensure that capitalized words are treated equally by the language model.
        
        # 3. Core Algorithm - Language Modeling
        
        Now let’s go over the core algorithm of language modeling – representing probabilities of sequences of words/symbols in a corpus based on observed frequencies. Let us assume that we have a collection of texts corpus consisting of $N$ documents, where each document contains a sequence of $L$ tokens. Each token can be a word or a symbol depending on whether we are dealing with text classification or named entity recognition tasks respectively. Suppose that we represent each token as a vector $    extbf{v}$ of dimensionality $D$, where $D$ represents the size of the vocabulary. The probability distribution over the next token can be calculated as follows:
        
        $$p(\mathbf{w}_k| \mathbf{w}_{k-1},\ldots,\mathbf{w}_{k-n+1}) = p(w_k | w_{k-1},\ldots, w_{k-n+1};     heta)$$
        
        Here, $    heta$ denotes the parameters of the model and includes the weights assigned to each word in the context. Assuming that $\mathbf{w}_k$ is generated conditioned on the previous $n-1$ words $(\mathbf{w}_{k-1},\ldots,\mathbf{w}_{k-n+1})$, we compute its conditional probability by applying a softmax function over a linear combination of vectors corresponding to the previously seen words:
        
        $$    ext{softmax}(f(\mathbf{w}_{k-1},\ldots,\mathbf{w}_{k-n+1}))_i=\frac{\exp f(\mathbf{v}_i^{T}\mathbf{w}_{k-1},\ldots,\mathbf{v}_i^{T}\mathbf{w}_{k-n+1})}{\sum_{\forall j} \exp f(\mathbf{v}_j^{T}\mathbf{w}_{k-1},\ldots,\mathbf{v}_j^{T}\mathbf{w}_{k-n+1})}$$
        
        Where $f$ refers to a neural network architecture implemented using TensorFlow.
        
        Our goal now is to estimate the joint distribution $P(\mathbf{w}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{w}_K)$ over all possible sequences of words in the corpus. One way to do this is to consider all possible subsets of length $n$ from the set of words ${1,\ldots,V}$, i.e., $\mathcal{S}=\{\emptyset,\{w_1\},\{w_1,w_2\},\ldots,\{w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_n\}}$ where $w_i$ indicates the index of the $i$-th word in the dictionary. Given a subset $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{S}$, the probability of generating the sequence $\{w_1,\ldots,w_n\}$ can be computed recursively as follows:
        
        $$P(\{w_1,\ldots,w_n\}| \mathcal{A}) = \prod_{i=1}^nP(w_i|\mathcal{A}_{<i})    imes P(\{w_i,\ldots,w_{n}\}| \{w_1,\ldots,w_{i-1}\}, \mathcal{A}_{<i})$$
        
        Where $\mathcal{A}_{<i}$ means the subset $\mathcal{A}\backslash\{w_i\}$. This formula is known as the chain rule of probability and helps to factorize the joint distribution into product of conditional probabilities.
        
        # 4. Code Implementation Using Tensorflow
        
        With the above mentioned background and explanation, we can now proceed towards implementing the language model using TensorFlow framework. Below is the Python code implementation for the same.

        ```python
        import tensorflow as tf

    ```
    
    The complete code creates a simple Seq2Seq LSTM model that takes sequences of tokens and predicts the next token based on the context. It uses GloVe embeddings for initializing the word embeddings. The `create_dataset` function processes the sentences and returns tensors of input data (`X`), expected encoder outputs (`encoder_input_data`) and expected decoder outputs (`decoder_output_data`). It also returns the vocabulary size for indexing purposes.
    
    The model is trained using the standard cross entropy loss function. The `train_step` function calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model variables using the GradientTape. The model variables are updated using the Adam Optimizer after calculating the gradients.
    
    The model is saved periodically during training to avoid losing progress in case of interruption. At regular intervals, the latest saved checkpoint is restored and tested on new sequences of input data until terminated manually.
