# 1.简介
         
 PyTorch is an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library, a scientific computing framework created by Facebook's AI research team. It is widely used for building complex neural networks and it offers support for dynamic computational graphs and automatic differentiation. In this article, we will explain how to use PyTorch from scratch to build deep learning models with advanced techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). By the end of the tutorial you should be able to create state-of-the-art image classification or sequence modeling tasks using PyTorch. 
          # 2.Basic Concepts & Terminology 
          ## A. Computational Graphs: 
          A computational graph is a directed acyclic graph that represents mathematical operations performed on input data to produce output data. PyTorch uses its own implementation of the concept called Dynamic Computation Graph which allows gradients to be calculated automatically without having to manually compute them. The main advantage of computation graphs over traditional forward propagation method is their ability to perform backpropagation efficiently during training, enabling gradient descent optimization algorithms. PyTorch also supports hardware acceleration through CUDA, cuDNN libraries.
          

          ## B. Tensors: 
          Tensor is a multi-dimensional matrix containing elements of a single type, such as integers, floats, or boolean values. These tensors are the basis for all computations in PyTorch and can have any number of dimensions between zero and three. Each tensor has associated with it a set of dimensions and a data type. PyTorch provides many built-in functions and operators for manipulating tensors. For example, one function is torch.cat() that concatenates two or more tensors along a specified dimension. There are other common tensor manipulation functions like transpose(), view(), squeeze() etc. 

          ### Broadcasting Rule: 
          Broadcasting rule describes how NumPy treats arrays of different shapes during arithmetic operations. In short, if two arrays differ only in their number of dimensions, NumPy compares their sizes element-wise starting from the last axis and repeats or tiles the smaller array to match the larger shape before performing the operation. The broadcasting process is repeated until both operands have matching shapes. When operating on two arrays, NumPy compares their shapes element-wise starting from the last axis and works its way backwards to determine the size of each resulting dimension. If these sizes are equal, the arrays can safely be broadcast together; otherwise, NumPy raises an error. Broadcasting enables us to add, multiply, divide, and subtract tensors of different shapes, provided that certain criteria are met. 

          Here is some sample code demonstrating broadcasting: 

          ```python
          import numpy as np
          
          x = np.array([[1], [2], [3]])
          y = np.array([4, 5, 6])
          z = x + y   # Output: [[5]
                           [7]
                           [9]]
                            
          w = np.ones((3, 1))
          v = w * x    # Output: [[1.]
                            [2.]
                            [3.]]
            
          t = np.zeros(y.shape) + 2  
          u = t / y      # Raises ValueError due to division by zero errors
          
          m = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
          n = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
          o = m - n     # Output: [[[-4 -4]
                             [-4 -4]]
                            [[-4 -4]
                             [-4 -4]]]
          ```

          Another interesting feature of PyTorch tensors is that they can run on GPU processors via CUDA libraries for faster processing. This makes PyTorch particularly well suited for large-scale deep learning applications where high performance is critical.          
          
          ## C. Autograd:
          Automatic Differentiation is a technique used in reverse mode calculus that calculates the derivative of a function with respect to its inputs using chain rule. Pytorch implements automatic differentiation system based on dynamic computation graphs. It constructs a graph at runtime representing the entire calculation and then performs backward passes to calculate derivatives. This approach avoids the need for symbolic differentiation which is notoriously difficult to implement correctly. 

          ## D. Modules: 
          PyTorch modules provide a higher level abstraction than raw tensors. They encapsulate both parameters (learnable weights) and non-parameterizable layers, allowing users to easily construct complex neural network architectures. We can create our custom modules by subclassing nn.Module class and defining the forward pass. Many popular predefined modules already exist in PyTorch, including linear layers, convolutional layers, recurrent layers, loss functions, activation functions etc. Moreover, there are numerous third party libraries available that extend PyTorch’s functionality.

          ## E. Optimization Algorithms: 
          One of the most important aspects of training a neural network model is optimizing its parameters to minimize the loss function. PyTorch supports various optimization algorithms such as SGD, ADAM, RMSProp, Adagrad, Adamax, etc., that allow us to fine-tune hyperparameters to achieve better results. All these algorithms work by updating the parameters of the model in response to the computed gradients. PyTorch also includes various helper functions like torch.optim.lr_scheduler module that help adjust the learning rate during training according to various scheduling policies.

           # 4. Implementation and Example Code 
           1. Import necessary packages:

            ```python
            import torch
            import torch.nn as nn
            import torch.optim as optim
            import torchvision.transforms as transforms
            import torchvision.datasets as datasets
            import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
            ```

           2. Define Hyperparameters:

            ```python
            device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
            
            batch_size = 128
            num_epochs = 10
            learning_rate = 0.01
            ```

           3. Load Dataset:

            ```python
            train_dataset = datasets.MNIST(root='./data',train=True,transform=transforms.ToTensor(),download=True)
            test_dataset = datasets.MNIST(root='./data',train=False,transform=transforms.ToTensor())
            
            train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset=train_dataset,batch_size=batch_size,shuffle=True)
            test_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset=test_dataset,batch_size=batch_size,shuffle=False)
            ```

           4. Create Network Architecture:

            ```python
            class Net(nn.Module):
                def __init__(self):
                    super(Net, self).__init__()
                    self.fc1 = nn.Linear(28*28, 512)
                    self.fc2 = nn.Linear(512, 256)
                    self.fc3 = nn.Linear(256, 10)
                
                def forward(self, x):
                    x = x.view(-1, 28*28)
                    x = nn.functional.relu(self.fc1(x))
                    x = nn.functional.relu(self.fc2(x))
                    x = self.fc3(x)
                    return nn.functional.softmax(x, dim=1)
                
            net = Net().to(device)
            criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
            optimizer = optim.Adam(net.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)
            ```

           5. Train Network:

            ```python
            total_step = len(train_loader)
            curr_loss = []
            curr_accu = []
            
            for epoch in range(num_epochs):
                for i, (images, labels) in enumerate(train_loader):
                    images = images.reshape(-1, 28*28).to(device)
                    labels = labels.to(device)
                    
                    outputs = net(images)
                    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
                    accu = accuracy(outputs, labels)
                        
                    optimizer.zero_grad()
                    loss.backward()
                    optimizer.step()
                        
                    if (i+1) % 10 == 0:
                        print ('Epoch [{}/{}], Step [{}/{}], Loss: {:.4f}, Accuracy: {:.2f}%' 
                              .format(epoch+1, num_epochs, i+1, total_step, loss.item(), accu.item()))
                        
                        curr_loss.append(loss.item())
                        curr_accu.append(accu.item())
                    
            fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2)
            axes[0].plot(curr_loss, label="Training Loss")
            axes[0].set_xlabel('Iteration')
            axes[0].set_ylabel('Loss')
            axes[0].legend()
            axes[1].plot(curr_accu, label="Training Accurracy")
            axes[1].set_xlabel('Iteration')
            axes[1].set_ylabel('Accurracy (%)')
            axes[1].legend()
            plt.show()   
            ```            

           6. Test Network:

            ```python
            correct = 0
            total = 0
            
            with torch.no_grad():
                for images, labels in test_loader:
                    images = images.reshape(-1, 28*28).to(device)
                    labels = labels.to(device)
                
                    outputs = net(images)
                    _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
                    
                    total += labels.size(0)
                    correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()
                    
                print('Test Accuracy of the model on the {} test images: {:.2f} %'.format(total, 100 * correct / total))
            ```
