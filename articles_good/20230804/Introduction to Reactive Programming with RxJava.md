# 1.简介
         
Reactive programming is a paradigm for developing applications that use asynchronous and event-based programming techniques. It allows developers to write more scalable, responsive, and maintainable software by unifying the flow of data and events through time rather than relying on threads or callbacks.

RxJava (pronounced "Rex") is one of the most popular reactive libraries for Java/Android development. It provides composable observables which allow us to build complex event processing systems without dealing directly with threads, locks, or concurrency control mechanisms. The library also features operators like filter(), map(), flatMap() etc., making it easy to manipulate streams of data in various ways. In this article, we will introduce you to reactive programming and RxJava by going through core concepts, defining terms, explaining algorithms, and providing examples using code snippets. Finally, we will discuss future challenges and directions for RxJava.

## Event Driven Architecture（事件驱动架构）
Event driven architecture (EDA) refers to an architectural pattern where components communicate asynchronously via events, instead of synchronous calls or requests. Events can be any meaningful occurrence that occurs within the system, such as user actions, sensor readings, hardware failures, service availability updates, etc. EDA enables loose coupling between components, allowing them to evolve independently while still reacting to changes in the system. This makes it easier to maintain, test, and scale large systems over time.

In traditional architectures, interactions between different parts of the system are often mediated by message passing protocols like HTTP or RPC. However, these protocols do not offer much flexibility in how messages are processed or reacted to. Additionally, they require additional infrastructure components to support messaging systems, such as brokers, routers, caches, and so on, increasing complexity and costs. EDA promotes greater decoupling of components, enabling them to work together seamlessly under the direction of an event-driven engine.

## Streams
A stream is an ongoing sequence of discrete events that occur over time. A stream may contain elements related to different topics, including stock prices, audio samples, mouse movements, or social media posts. Each element of the stream is delivered to some recipient at a specific point in time called its timestamp. Streams can vary in both frequency and volume, from thousands per second to millions per hour.

Streams typically have two basic operations:

1. Transformation - Transformations apply some operation to each element of the stream to produce new elements according to a specified function or algorithm. For example, we might filter out all tweets containing certain keywords, convert temperature measurements from Celsius to Fahrenheit, or compute the average speed of vehicles traveling along a road.

2. Combination - Combinations combine multiple streams into a single output stream based on some criteria. For example, we could merge several sensor streams to monitor traffic conditions, or combine real-time logs from multiple servers to provide a global view of application behavior.

To process streams efficiently, we need to take advantage of reactive principles such as backpressure, laziness, immutability, and sharing. These principles enable us to handle infinite or high-velocity streams while minimizing resource usage. Backpressure ensures that the source component does not overload the destination component, while laziness avoids unnecessary computation until absolutely necessary. Immutability helps ensure thread safety and simplifies state management. Sharing allows multiple subscribers to access the same underlying stream concurrently, reducing memory consumption and improving efficiency.

## Observables
Observables represent sequences of values over time that can emit zero or more items, such as numbers, strings, or other objects. They act as event streams but differ in that they deliver their events only when requested. This contrasts with regular event streams, which deliver all events simultaneously.

An observable behaves as follows:

1. Creation - An observable is created by subscribing to an event stream or another observable. When an observer subscribes to an observable, it begins receiving notifications of emitted events.

2. Notification - Asynchronously, the observable emits values to observers upon subscription or emission of a value. The notification mechanism varies depending on the type of observable used. For instance, some observables emit elements one at a time, while others may buffer and batch elements before sending them to observers.

3. Consumption - After an observer has subscribed to an observable, it receives notifications about emitted events in real-time. While observers consume events continuously, the observable maintains a buffer of pending events until consumers request them.

## Subscribers
Subscribers are entities that register interest in events being emitted by an observable. They receive copies of the events as they arrive, either immediately or once the entire stream has been consumed. In addition to simple event listeners, subscribers can perform complex transformations or calculations on the received events.

There are three types of subscribers:

1. Simple Subscriber - Receives individual events sent by the observable.

2. Observer - Receives all events from the start of the observable up to the current moment, regardless of whether they were already emitted or buffered.

3. Processor - Receives batches of events from the observable, combining or transforming them into new forms before forwarding them to downstream subscribers.

## Operators
Operators are building blocks for constructing observable chains. They are functions that accept one or more observables as input and return a new observable as output. Operations include filtering, mapping, flattening, joining, grouping, windowing, etc. Some operators transform the sequence of events emitted by an observable, while others combine or aggregate multiple sources of events into a single output.

The key feature of operators is that they preserve the structure of the original observable chain, making it easy to construct and manage complex flows of data. They also make it possible to share common logic across multiple observable chains, leading to modular design patterns.

## Schedulers
Schedulers determine how events should be executed and scheduled for delivery to subscribers. They control the order in which events are produced and dispatched to subscribers, ensuring consistent behavior even under heavy load or multi-threading scenarios. Schedulers can operate in two modes:

1. Trampoline Scheduler - Executes each task synchronously on the calling thread. Tasks submitted using the trampoline scheduler are executed immediately and synchronously, avoiding stack overflow issues.

2. NewThread Scheduler - Creates a separate thread for each task, running the tasks on those threads. This mode can improve performance under I/O intensive workloads or long-running computations.

## Creating and Subscribing to an Observable
To create an observable, we first define the set of values that it will send, then wrap it inside an Observable object. To subscribe to an observable, we pass in an observer object, which implements the Observer interface. Here's an example:

```java
Observable<String> observable = Observable.just("Hello", "World");

Observer<String> observer = new Observer<String>() {
    @Override
    public void onSubscribe(Disposable d) {}

    @Override
    public void onNext(String s) {
        System.out.println(s);
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(Throwable e) {}

    @Override
    public void onComplete() {}
};

observable.subscribe(observer);
```

This creates a String observable and registers an observer object to listen to it. Whenever the observable produces a new string value, the observer prints it to the console. We call the `subscribe()` method to establish the connection between the observable and the observer. 

We can also define the observer inline inside the `subscribe()` method itself, like this:

```java
observable.subscribe(new Consumer<String>() {
    @Override
    public void accept(String s) throws Exception {
        System.out.println(s);
    }
});
```

Here, we're using a functional interface `Consumer` from the RxJava API to specify our observer. We simply implement the `accept()` method to print the incoming string to the console. This works just like the previous example, but uses lambda expressions instead of anonymous inner classes.

Finally, if we want to use error handling or completion callbacks, we can extend the Observer class accordingly:

```java
class MyObserver extends Observer<String> {
    private final Disposable mDisposable;
    
    public MyObserver(Disposable d) {
        mDisposable = d;
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onSubscribe(Disposable d) {
        // Save the Disposable so we can dispose of it later
        mDisposable = d;
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onNext(String s) {
        System.out.println(s);
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onError(Throwable e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onComplete() {
        System.out.println("Done!");
    }
}

MyObserver myObserver = new MyObserver(null);
observable.subscribeWith(myObserver);

// Later...
if (!myObserver.isDisposed()) {
    myObserver.dispose();
}
```

In this case, we've defined a custom observer subclass called `MyObserver`. We save a reference to the Disposable returned by the `subscribeWith()` method in our constructor so that we can dispose of it later, if needed. If the observer is disposed, we know that the subscription was cancelled and we don't need to continue receiving events.

## Operators
Operators are functions that take one or more observables as input, apply some transformation, and return a new observable as output. There are many built-in operators available in RxJava that cover common use cases, such as filtering, transforming, merging, aggregating, multicasting, and so on. Here's an example:

```java
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.range(1, 5);

source.map(new Function<Integer, Integer>() {
    @Override
    public Integer apply(Integer i) throws Exception {
        return i * 2;
    }
})
.filter(new Predicate<Integer>() {
    @Override
    public boolean test(Integer i) throws Exception {
        return i > 5;
    }
}).subscribe(new Observer<Integer>() {
    @Override
    public void onSubscribe(Disposable d) {
        System.out.println("onSubscribe()");
    }

    @Override
    public void onNext(Integer i) {
        System.out.println(i);
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(Throwable e) {
        System.err.println("onError(): " + e.getMessage());
    }

    @Override
    public void onComplete() {
        System.out.println("onComplete()");
    }
});
```

In this example, we're creating an integer range from 1 to 5 using `Observable.range()`. Then, we're applying a mapping operator (`map()`) to multiply each number by 2. Next, we're adding a filter operator (`filter()`) to exclude any numbers less than or equal to 5. Finally, we're subscribing to the resulting observable, printing the results to the console. Note that we're also implementing error and complete callback methods in our observer implementation.

Each operator takes an optional parameter that determines how it should behave in certain circumstances, such as whether it should block until all upstream sources have completed or terminate if any of them fail. By default, operators run on the same scheduler as the source observable, unless otherwise specified.

Some important operators include `map()`, `flatmap()`, `filter()`, `distinct()`, `debounce()`, `buffer()`, `window()`, `skip()`, `take()`, `concat()`, `merge()`, `switchLatest()`, `zip()`, `combineLatest()`, and so on. You can find detailed documentation for all operators in the official RxJava API.
