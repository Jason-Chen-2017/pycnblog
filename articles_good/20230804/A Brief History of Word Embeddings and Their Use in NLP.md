# 1.简介
         
1950年代，英文单词"word embedding"第一次出现在著名的科幻小说“狄更斯的通灵秘笈”中。当时，英语被视作计算机和语言处理领域的主要研究对象，因此，Word Embedding这一术语也被用来描述整个领域中的重要研究成果。
          1980年代，计算机模型如相似性匹配算法(similarity matching algorithms)或聚类算法(clustering algorithms)开始广泛使用。由于每一个词都对应着一个向量表示(vector representation)，所以相关的算法就可以利用这些向量来计算相似度或者聚类结果。然而，人们发现这些向量表示并不是自然语言的有效表示形式。为了解决这个问题，提出了词嵌入(Word Embedding)的概念。
          1980年，Bordes、Levy及其合作者发表了“Learning Distributed Representations of Texts and Documents”一文，介绍了词嵌入的一些基本概念。1983年，Mikolov等人首次提出了一种简单有效的方法——基于共现矩阵的矩阵分解方法(Matrix Factorization)。
          1997年，三维空间下的词嵌入已经成为人们关注的热点。随后，三元组、Skip-Gram、Negative Sampling等模型被提出，帮助词嵌入算法更好地适应于实际应用场景。
          2003年，Linguistic Regularities in Continuous Space Word Representations第一次在NIPS上被发表。这是对词嵌入方法进行了一个系统化的总结，提供了一些新思路和方法。
          2013年，Deep Learning[1]在Nature上发表了一篇论文。它指出，深度学习模型的成功，使得词嵌入方法得到更加深刻的理解和实践。与此同时，对于如何更好地训练词嵌入方法，Bengio等人[2]提出了一种新的训练方法。
          在过去的30多年里，词嵌入方法逐渐成为自然语言处理领域中最流行的工具之一。它不仅帮助了机器学习模型解决了复杂的问题，而且还促进了自然语言学、语音识别和信息检索等多个领域的进步。

        # 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
        ##  2.1 Definition
        ###  2.1.1 Word Embeddings
        In the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), a **word embedding** is a dense vector representation of words that capture various semantic and syntactic properties of the words. It maps each word to an n-dimensional vector space where n can be millions or billions of dimensions. These vectors are learned from large corpora of text data using machine learning techniques such as neural networks and deep learning. Word embeddings have been shown to improve performance on many NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, machine translation, and topic modeling. Some popular types of word embeddings include **Word2Vec**, **GloVe**, and **FastText**. 

        Let's understand how these word embeddings work by understanding their basic concepts. 

        ###  2.1.2 Vector Representation
        #### What is a vector?

        #### How do we represent words using vectors?
        To represent words using vectors, we assign unique numbers to each letter or character present in our vocabulary. Each dimension of the vector would correspond to a particular letter or character depending on the context. For instance, consider the following sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." The corresponding vector representation for the same sentence could be:

            The    -0.12    0.43     0.66
            quick -0.34    0.21    -0.55
            brown   0.41   -0.35     0.56
            fox     0.23   -0.31     0.51
            jumps   -0.28    0.05    -0.45
            over    -0.10   -0.29     0.55
            the      0.55    0.11    -0.54
            lazy    0.58    0.09    -0.48
            dog     -0.35   -0.24     0.38

        Here, the values along the axes represent the features associated with those letters or characters. In practice, these features can be derived using various methods such as bag-of-words or skip-grams models. However, even without providing any training dataset, these feature vectors can already give us some useful insights into the relationships between words and phrases. Hence, a simple initial approach to create word embeddings often involves initializing the vectors randomly or by training them on a corpus of textual data. 

        ###  2.1.3 Bag-of-Words Model
        The first step towards creating word embeddings is to tokenize the text into individual tokens (e.g. words or substrings), remove stop words, punctuation marks, and perform stemming or lemmatization if required. Then, we build a vocabulary containing all the unique tokens found in the text. After that, we count the frequency of occurrence of each token within the entire text. Finally, we convert the counts into probabilities so that each token has its own distinctive weighting according to its co-occurrence with other tokens in the document. This model assigns equal weights to every word regardless of their specific importance in the context of the whole text. 

                Example: Consider the following paragraph:

                "I went to the bank to deposit my money. While doing so, he noticed me looking out the window. He asked me what was wrong with me and why were we standing there?"
                
                Using the bag-of-words model, the resulting word frequencies table for this text might look something like this:

                 |      |    went |     to |   the |...
                 |------|--------|--------|-------|----------
                 | i    |       1|       1|      1|...
                 | went |       1|       1|      0|...
                 | to   |       1|       1|      0|...
                 | the  |       1|       0|      1|...
                 |...  |       1|       0|      0|...

                 
        Note: The above table assumes that the input text is treated as one document. If it contains multiple documents, then we need to concatenate them before calculating the word frequencies. Also, we may encounter cases where certain words appear frequently across multiple texts, while others only occur once or twice in a given text. In order to handle this situation better, we can normalize the word frequencies based on the total number of tokens or documents in the corpus.
        
        ###  2.1.4 Skip-Grams Model
        One limitation of the bag-of-words model is that it treats all sequential pairs of words as independent entities, which ignores the fact that adjacent words tend to occur together. Therefore, researchers proposed another way to extract relevant information called skip-gram. This model treats each word as center word and tries to predict its neighbors on the left side and right side of itself in the sequence. Intuitively, the left and right contexts provide valuable clues as to whether the current word should be regarded as synonymous or related to other words in the sentence. The skip-grams model can be trained efficiently using negative sampling method.

        
               Example: Consider the following sentence "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog":

               If we choose 'quick' as center word and train the skip-grams model to predict 'brown', 'fox', and 'jumps', we obtain the following sample triplets:

                    ('quick', 'brown')
                    ('quick', 'fox')
                    ('quick', 'jumps')

                    
        Again, note that we need to exclude the original target word from the context set to prevent the model from memorizing it. Also, we need to ensure that the model covers all possible combinations of context words. Lastly, when evaluating the accuracy of the model, we typically compare the predicted probability distribution versus the actual word frequencies instead of directly comparing the output labels. 
        
      ##  2.2 Types of Word Embeddings
       There are several popular types of word embeddings, including **Word2Vec**, **GloVe**, **FastText**, and **Transformer-based embeddings**. Below, let’s discuss each type in detail:
       
       ###  2.2.1 Word2Vec
       Word2Vec is a common technique used to generate high-quality vector representations for words. The underlying idea behind this algorithm is to train a shallow neural network on a large corpus of text to learn continuous vector representations for words. When presented with new text, the network attempts to predict the likelihood of each word being the correct continuation of the previous word. By analyzing the local relationships among the words and propagating this knowledge through the hidden layer connections, Word2Vec produces highly accurate vector representations. Word2Vec achieves state-of-the-art results in many NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, machine translation, and topic modeling. Some notable advantages of Word2Vec include:
       
       * Flexible architecture – You can adjust the size and complexity of the neural network architecture easily to suit your needs.
       * Word sense disambiguation – Word2Vec provides robust solutions for dealing with polysemy and ambiguity issues.
       * Efficient computation – Word2Vec uses efficient optimization techniques such as hierarchical softmax and negative sampling to reduce memory usage and increase efficiency.
       
       Figures 2 and 3 show examples of commonly used architectures for Word2Vec.

   ###  2.2.2 GloVe
   GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) is another famous technique for generating vector representations for words. The key difference between GloVe and Word2Vec lies in the way they handle the co-occurrence statistics. Rather than considering only individual word occurrences, GloVe considers neighboring word pairs as well. Moreover, GloVe uses a weighted average of the logarithmic conditional probabilities rather than just taking the maximum value to account for the uncertainty in the estimation. As a result, GloVe generates more accurate and diverse vector representations compared to Word2Vec. Unlike Word2Vec, GloVe does not require any pretraining or labeled data, making it ideal for applications requiring fast convergence and handling large datasets. Examples of commonly used architectures for GloVe include CBOW (Continuous Bag-Of-Words) and SGNS (Skip-Gram Negative Sampling).

   ###  2.2.3 FastText
   FastText combines the strengths of word embeddings generated by GloVe and Word2Vec. Instead of treating individual words independently, FastText jointly trains a shared subspace for both sentences and word vectors. Within this framework, words are represented as distributions over discrete latent spaces, which allows for faster inference during prediction time. At the same time, FastText offers improvements in transfer learning, reducing the amount of data needed for training and enabling it to adapt to different languages and domains. Other variants of FastText also exist such as averaged word embeddings or probabilistic word embeddings.
   
   ###  2.2.4 Transformer-Based Embeddings
   Transformers, recently introduced by Google AI Research team, offer an exciting alternative to traditional word embeddings. They exploit the ability of transformers to parallelize operations on sequences, which makes them particularly suitable for learning vector representations for long sequences. In contrast to traditional approaches, transformer-based embeddings encode entire sequences rather than single tokens, allowing them to capture complex linguistic patterns and dependencies. Currently, transformer-based embeddings are widely used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation, question answering, and summarization. 
   
   # 3. Core Algorithmic Principles and Techniques
    ##  3.1 Matrix Factorization
    One of the most successful tools for converting sparse word embeddings into low-dimensional dense vectors is matrix factorization. The goal of matrix factorization is to find two lower-rank matrices, U and V, such that we minimize the Frobenius norm || X - UV^T ||^2, where X is the original matrix representing the word embeddings. 

    Since X is usually very sparse, this problem becomes challenging since naive implementations would likely suffer from excessive computational cost. Luckily, recent advancements in linear algebra have made it feasible to solve this problem efficiently. Two main classes of matrix factorization methods fall under the category of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA):

    1. Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA)

    PLSA explores the hypothesis that the factors U and V should come from a generative process that captures the structure of the word embedding space. Specifically, it proposes a model of the form P(w_i | w_{j'}) = \alpha p(z_i) f(\beta v_j'^T u_i +     heta_{ij'}), where z is a latent variable capturing the source of the observation (usually a document or sentence); v and u are latent variables representing the factors; and j' indexes the neighborhood of j around w_i.
    
    PLSA addresses the sparsity issue of X by imposing priors on the latent variables and utilizing clustering techniques to identify underlying groups of related words. It is known to achieve good performance in natural language processing tasks such as topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition. 
    
    2. Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
    
    NMF is a variant of matrix factorization that promotes non-negativity constraints on the elements of the matrices. Formally, we seek a solution to minimize ||X - UV^T||_F subject to U >= 0, V >= 0. Despite the added constraint, NMF still retains the property of finding two low-rank matrices whose product approximates X. NMF has been shown to perform well on a variety of natural language processing tasks, especially tasks involving collaborative filtering and image annotation. 
    
    ###  3.1.1 Alternatives to Matrix Factorization
    Another popular tool for learning vector representations for words is Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which involves projecting the original matrix onto a smaller set of uncorrelated components. However, PCA cannot capture the geometry and meaning of the relationship between words due to the absence of prior assumptions. Furthermore, PCA suffers from the curse of dimentionality, which means that it loses precision beyond a certain threshold. On the other hand, PPMI (Pointwise Mutual Information) can help approximate the similarity between words, which can be helpful for identifying meaningful clusters of related words. PPMI relies on counting the frequency of pairwise co-occurrences of words within a fixed window, whereas LSA, PLSA, and NMF focus on capturing global structure and statistical dependencies respectively. 
    
    # 4. Technical Details and Code Implementation
    ##  4.1 Word2Vec Model Architecture
    The Word2Vec model consists of two main components: an encoder network and a decoder network. The encoder network takes a sequence of words as input and outputs a fixed-size vector representation for each word. The decoder network is responsible for producing the next word given the preceding ones. The encoder and decoder networks share parameters and are trained simultaneously to maximize the likelihood of observing the true target words given the input context. The model works as follows:
   
    Input Sequence → Preprocess → Context Window Selection → Softmax Prediction → Backpropagation
   
    ###  4.1.1 Preprocessing
    Before feeding the input sequence to the model, we preprocess it by removing special characters, punctuations, digits, and stop words. Additionally, we split the sequence into windows of a specified size, and for each window, we compute a centered context window consisting of a subset of nearby words. This ensures that the model has sufficient context to make accurate predictions. Next, we apply a subsampling rate to downsample frequent words to avoid overfitting.
   
    ###  4.1.2 Softmax Prediction
    Once we have computed the context windows, we pass them through an embedding layer to produce a high-dimensional vector representation for each word. We then pass the vector representations through a fully connected layer to produce a probability distribution over the next word in the sequence. The softmax function is applied to the output of the fully connected layer to yield a normalized score for each candidate word, indicating its relative likelihood.
   
    ###  4.1.3 Backpropagation
    The objective function used to optimize the parameters of the model is the cross-entropy loss, which measures the distance between the predicted probability distribution and the empirical distribution of observed words in the context. We backpropagate gradients through each component of the model, updating the parameters to minimize the loss. Finally, we repeat this process until convergence or until we reach a desired stopping criterion.
   
    ###  4.2 FastText Model Architecture
    FastText is an extension of the Word2Vec model that supports subword units. Subword units refer to the atomic pieces of a word that are combined to form the final word. For example, the word "playstation" can be broken up into three subword units: "play", "##station". The embedding layer learns to represent each subword unit as a vector, and the rest of the architecture remains the same as the Word2Vec model. In addition to the standard architecture, FastText introduces two additional mechanisms:
    
    #### Hierarchical Softmax Loss
    The second mechanism adds hierarchy to the model by introducing a tree structure to the subword units. Under this scheme, each parent node represents a group of child nodes and corresponds to a prefix of the overall word. The leaf nodes correspond to the individual subword units. The label for each node comes from the concatenation of the corresponding children. During training, the model predicts the path taken through the tree to arrive at a given leaf node.
   
    #### Negative Sampling Loss
    The third mechanism improves the scalability of the model by reducing the dependency between neighboring subword units. Instead of computing the full softmax probability distribution for the context window, the model samples negatively labeled random subword units. This reduces the computational load and enables the model to converge much faster than regular softmax. 
    
    ##  4.3 TensorFlow Implementation
    Several open-source libraries exist that implement word embeddings using neural networks. One of the most popular ones is TensorFlow. The code below demonstrates how to implement Word2Vec and FastText models in TensorFlow:
