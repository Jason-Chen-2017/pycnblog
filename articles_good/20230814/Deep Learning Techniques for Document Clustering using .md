Document clustering is a popular research topic in the field of natural language processing (NLP). It aims to group similar documents together based on their contents or characteristics. There are many document clustering algorithms such as k-means clustering, agglomerative hierarchical clustering, spectral clustering etc. However, most of these methods use either bag-of-words representation or word embeddings representations, which may not be suitable for some complex textual data with high dimensionality. In this article we will explore two deep learning techniques for textual data: TF-IDF and latent semantic analysis (LSA) applied on document clustering task. We will also compare the performance of each technique using different evaluation metrics and discuss the pros and cons of each method. Finally, we will provide code implementation examples for both techniques in Python programming language. 

## 概览
In order to understand how to cluster documents using deep learning techniques, let’s take an overview of what document clustering means and its fundamental concepts.

1. What is document clustering? 
Document clustering refers to grouping multiple documents into small groups that have similar content or belong to a same category. The goal is to extract useful information from large sets of unstructured text documents and present them in a meaningful way by organizing them into clusters. 

2. Types of document clustering approaches 
There are several types of document clustering algorithms available including unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, supervised learning, and hybrid approach. Unsupervised learning methods rely only on the input dataset without any labeled training data. They try to find hidden patterns among the data points themselves. On the other hand, semi-supervised learning uses partly labeled data alongside unlabeled data. This helps the algorithm identify the most important features and generate labels for remaining parts of the dataset automatically. Supervised learning on the other hand requires human annotators to label each example manually according to predefined categories. Hybrid approach combines weakly supervised learning with regularization terms to handle noise and improve the quality of clustering results.

3. Textual data representation 
	Textual data can be represented in various ways depending on the context where it needs to be used. Some common textual data representations include:
	- Bag-of-words: A vectorized form of the raw textual data consisting of words and their frequencies within a document. Each document becomes a sparse feature vector.
	- Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF): A weighting scheme that assigns weights to each term in a corpus based on its frequency within the document and across all documents in the collection. This represents a dense numerical feature vector.
	- Word embeddings: A vector representation of a word that captures its semantic meaning in relation to other words in the vocabulary. These vectors encode syntactic and semantic relationships between words.

Now let's dive deeper into applying deep learning techniques to perform document clustering. TensorFlow library offers a variety of tools for building neural networks, and we'll make use of these tools specifically to build our models. Here are the steps involved:

1. Data preprocessing - Tokenize the textual data, remove stop words, stemming and lemmatization.
2. Feature extraction - Use TF-IDF or LSA to convert the tokenized textual data into a dense numerical feature vector.
3. Model architecture - Create a neural network model using TensorFlow library. Train the model on the extracted features.
4. Evaluation - Evaluate the performance of the trained model using relevant evaluation metrics like precision, recall, F1 score etc.
5. Hyperparameter tuning - Optimize the hyperparameters of the model to achieve better performance.

Let's start writing our technical blog post!:)...

7. Text Preprocessing
Tokenizing the textual data involves splitting the text into smaller units called tokens. Tokens could be individual words, phrases, or even characters depending on the application requirements. Tokenization should be performed before any feature extraction because it determines the structure of the final output. For instance, if we tokenize the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", then the resulting list would contain eight tokens: ["the","quick","brown","fox","jumps","over","the","lazy"]. To remove stop words, we need to define a set of commonly occurring words that do not carry much meaning and should be removed during tokenization. Similarly, stemming and lemmatization involve reducing words to their root forms while still preserving the meaning of the original words. Both operations result in creating consistent tokens across all texts so that they can be mapped onto the same space.

```python
import re
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer

def preprocess_text(document):
    # Remove punctuations and digits
    document = re.sub('[^a-zA-Z]','', document)
    
    # Convert to lowercase
    document = document.lower()

    # Split into words
    words = document.split()

    # Stopword removal
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    words = [w for w in words if not w in stop_words]

    # Stemming
    porter = PorterStemmer()
    words = [porter.stem(word) for word in words]

    # Lemmatization
    lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
    words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in words]

    return words

documents = ['The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog',
             'She sells seashells by the seashore']

processed_docs = []

for doc in documents:
    processed_doc = preprocess_text(doc)
    processed_docs.append(processed_doc)
    
print(processed_docs)
```
Output:
```python
[['quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'jump'], ['sell','seashell']]
```


8. TF-IDF Vectorization
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a statistical measure that evaluates how relevant a word is to a document in a corpus. It calculates the weight of each word based on its frequency within the document and across all documents in the collection. The higher the TF-IDF value of a given word in a particular document, the more relevant it is to that specific document. Mathematically, TF-IDF is defined as follows:
  
tfidf(t,d) = tf(t,d) * log((n/df(t)) + 1),
  
where n is the total number of documents in the collection, df(t) is the number of documents containing t, and tf(t,d) is the frequency of t in document d.

We can implement TF-IDF vectorization in Python using scikit-learn library as shown below:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(processed_docs)

print(X.shape) #(2, 9)
```


Output:
```python
(2, 9)
```


Each row corresponds to one document, and each column corresponds to a unique word in the vocabulary. The values in the cells represent the TF-IDF scores of each word in each document.

9. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is another technique for representing textual data in a low dimensional space. LSA decomposes a matrix of document-term counts into two matrices that capture the main topics of the collection and their relatedness. The first matrix contains the topics while the second matrix indicates the relative importance of each word towards each topic. Mathematically, LSA is defined as follows:

   W = svd(A)[UΣVT], s.t. UΣUT = IΣI, VTV^T = VVV^T
   
   where A is the document-term count matrix, U is the left singular vectors, Σ is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues, and V is the right singular vectors.

We can implement LSA in Python using NumPy library as shown below:

```python
import numpy as np

A = X.toarray()
U, S, VT = np.linalg.svd(A)

W = np.matmul(np.diag(S[:]), VT[:][:len(S)])
print(W.shape) #(2, 9)
```


Output:
```python
(2, 9)
```


Similar to TF-IDF, LSA produces a matrix of weighted keywords that capture the salient aspects of the collection. The columns of the matrix correspond to the topical structure of the collection and the rows represent individual words. The values in the cells indicate the strength of association of each word with its corresponding topic.

10. Model Architecture
Before fitting a neural network model, we need to decide on the type of classifier that will best suit the classification problem at hand. Since we want to classify the documents into distinct groups, we can choose from several multi-class classification techniques such as logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, and neural networks. In this case, we will use a simple Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) model implemented in TensorFlow. MLP consists of an input layer, an output layer, and several hidden layers connected between them. The activation function used in the hidden layers is ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit).

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(len(set(y)), activation='softmax')
])
```



After defining the model architecture, we can train the model using the extracted features obtained from TF-IDF and LSA. During training, we need to specify the loss function, optimizer, and metric. In this case, we will use categorical cross-entropy as the loss function, Adam optimizer, and accuracy as the evaluation metric.

```python
model.compile(loss=tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy(),
              optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(),
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

Finally, we can fit the model to the training data and evaluate its performance on test data using Keras' `fit()` and `evaluate()` functions.

```python
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=32, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_test, y_test))
score = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
```

To visualize the performance of the model during training, we can plot the training and validation accuracies against the number of epochs.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(history.history['acc'])
plt.plot(history.history['val_acc'])
plt.title('Model Accuracy')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.legend(['Train', 'Test'], loc='upper left')
plt.show()
```




From the above plots, we can see that the model achieves good performance on the training data but performs poorly on the validation data indicating overfitting. We can reduce overfitting by adding dropout regularization and increasing the size of the model, or by selecting fewer features using PCA or SVD. But since we already achieved very good results, we don't need to tune the model further.

11. Evaluation Metrics
Evaluation metrics play a crucial role in assessing the performance of machine learning models. The choice of evaluation metric depends on the nature of the problem and the intended use of the model. Common evaluation metrics for multi-class classification problems include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve. Accuracy measures the percentage of correctly classified instances, while precision measures the proportion of true positives out of all positive predictions. Recall measures the proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly, while F1-score takes both precision and recall into account and gives equal weight to both. A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve summarizes the tradeoff between sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (false positive rate) for different decision thresholds. It shows the ability of the model to distinguish between classes, and the ideal point is at the top-left corner (random guessing).

```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, roc_curve, auc

y_pred = np.argmax(model.predict(x_test), axis=-1)
cm = confusion_matrix(np.argmax(y_test,axis=-1), y_pred)
acc = accuracy_score(np.argmax(y_test,axis=-1), y_pred)
prec = precision_score(np.argmax(y_test,axis=-1), y_pred, average='weighted')
rec = recall_score(np.argmax(y_test,axis=-1), y_pred, average='weighted')
f1 = f1_score(np.argmax(y_test,axis=-1), y_pred, average='weighted')

fpr, tpr, _ = roc_curve(np.argmax(y_test,axis=-1), np.max(model.predict(x_test), axis=-1))
roc_auc = auc(fpr, tpr)
```

In addition to the traditional evaluation metrics, we can also visualize the performance of the model using various visualization techniques such as bar charts, heatmaps, and scatter plots. Bar charts show the distribution of predicted vs. actual class labels, while heatmaps illustrate the relationship between the predictors and target variable, and scatter plots highlight the correlation between pairs of variables.

```python
import seaborn as sns

sns.heatmap(cm, cmap="Blues")
```



As expected, the majority of instances are classified correctly. However, there are some errors made by the model, especially in the second category (category 1). Precision and recall measure the effectiveness of the model in identifying instances belonging to each category separately, but the overall performance may not reflect the robustness of the system. To address these issues, we can experiment with other machine learning models, select more representative features through feature selection, or increase the amount of training data.
