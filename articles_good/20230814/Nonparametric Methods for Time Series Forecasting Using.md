# 1.简介
  

Convolutional neural networks have been widely used in time series forecasting because of its ability to extract valuable features from the input data and then use them as input to learn patterns within the data that can help predict future values. However, traditional methods such as ARIMA or seasonal decomposition cannot handle non-stationary time series well due to their fixed structure and do not take into account all possible relationships between variables. In this paper, we propose a novel approach using regularized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that is able to capture complex temporal dependencies between variables in order to perform accurate predictions on non-stationary time series data.

In this work, we present a new family of methods called nonparametric regression based on CNNs that allows us to capture high-order nonlinear dependencies among variables in time series without relying on assumptions about underlying stochastic processes or parametric models. These methods are inspired by the recent success of deep learning techniques applied to image processing, where it has shown impressive performance in solving various tasks like object recognition, segmentation, and classification. To make our proposed method effective for time series prediction, we introduce several improvements over conventional approaches including:

1. We extend the range of operation of standard CNN architectures to include recurrent layers, which allow us to capture long-term correlations in time series.
2. Instead of assuming any functional form for the time series trend, we fit a linear combination of autoregressive terms with shared parameters across all variables, allowing us to model higher-order interactions between variables.
3. To avoid overfitting when training the network, we apply regularization techniques such as dropout and L2 norm constraints, which encourage the network to find more robust and generalizable representations of the data.
4. Finally, since the goal of these methods is to produce accurate forecasts for large-scale real-world time series data sets, we further optimize the hyperparameters of the architecture using Bayesian optimization techniques, which helps select appropriate settings automatically based on the available resources and feedback obtained during training.

The rest of the article will be organized as follows: Section 2 introduces some background concepts related to time series forecasting and machine learning. Section 3 discusses the basic ideas behind our proposed method and shows how we modify existing CNN architectures to achieve the desired results. Section 4 provides detailed instructions and code examples for implementing our methodology, while section 5 presents future directions and challenges for improving the performance of our algorithm. Finally, appendix section includes common questions and answers that may arise during reading or implementation of the above mentioned topics. Overall, the article aims to provide an accessible overview of state-of-the-art techniques and research findings in time series analysis and forecasting with emphasis on addressing important limitations and advantages of the current methods compared to other popular alternatives.


# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminologies
## 2.1 Time Series Data Analysis
A time series is a sequence of observations taken at different times or intervals. It can represent a wide variety of phenomena such as stock prices, sales figures, weather measurements, electricity consumption, etc., and it usually contains multiple variables measured simultaneously at different points in time. Commonly, time series data contain missing values, which makes it challenging for statistical modeling and inference tasks. Therefore, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, normalization, and feature extraction techniques are required to preprocess the dataset before applying machine learning algorithms. 

## 2.2 Types of Time Series Analysis Techniques
There are many types of time series analysis techniques. Some commonly used ones are:

1. **Classical Statistical Methods:** Classical statistical methods involve extracting significant patterns or trends from the time series through stationarity testing, time-domain analysis, and frequency domain analysis. Examples of classical methods include AR(p), MA(q), and ARIMA(p,d,q). 

2. **Frequency Domain Methods:** Frequency domain methods utilize Fourier transform to decompose the time series into sinusoids, cosines, and constant components, thereby identifying intrinsic cycles and frequencies. Examples of frequency domain methods include STL (Seasonal and Trend Decomposition using LOESS), Holt-Winter’s Exponential Smoothing (HWES), and TBATS (Time Bands And Seasonality Transformation).

3. **Wavelet Transform:** Wavelet transforms offer another way to decompose the time series into different wavelets, making it easier to identify global and local patterns. Examples of wavelet transform methods include Morlet CWT (Continuous Wavelet Transform) and Daubechies CWT (Complex Wavelet Transform).

4. **Vector Autoregressive Model (VAR):** VAR models are designed to analyze multivariate time series data and infer causal relationships among the variables. They assume that past values of one variable influence the next value of that same variable and that past errors influence future errors. Examples of VAR models include Vector Autoregression (VAR), AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA), and Granger causality tests.

5. **Deep Learning Methods:** Deep learning methods use artificial neural networks to automatically discover useful patterns and trends in the time series. The most popular deep learning models for time series forecasting are Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Examples of deep learning methods include DeepAR, N-BEATS, GluonTS, and PyTorch Forecasting.

## 2.3 Convolutional Neural Networks
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of feedforward artificial neural network that is particularly good at handling spatial images and natural language sequences. It consists of stacked layers of filters that learn local patterns in the input data. Each layer receives an activation map as output, which is computed by convolving the input with each filter weight. This process is repeated until the entire input volume is processed. The final result is typically a single vector, which represents the content of the original input. CNNs have demonstrated exceptional performance in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation, but they may also be suitable for time series forecasting problems if properly configured and trained.

# 3. Methodology and Algorithm
Our proposed method uses regularized CNNs to capture complex temporal dependencies between variables in order to perform accurate predictions on non-stationary time series data. Specifically, we follow the following steps:

1. Preprocess the time series data: Our first step is to preprocess the raw time series data by normalizing it and removing outliers. Normalization involves shifting and scaling the data so that it falls within certain prescribed ranges, whereas removal of outliers refers to identifying and eliminating unusual observations that significantly distort the distribution of the data. For example, we might decide to remove any observation that exceeds three standard deviations away from the mean.

2. Define the dependent and independent variables: Next, we split the dataset into two parts - a set of dependent variables and a set of independent variables. Dependent variables correspond to those observed values that we want to forecast, while independent variables refer to the factors affecting those observations, i.e., exogenous variables. In this case, we consider the entire dataset as both dependent and independent variables, since we aim to create a model that captures all relevant temporal dynamics. Note that we can choose specific subsets of variables depending on whether we believe them to be causing the dependence.

3. Perform ACF test and visualize the correlation matrix: Since we aim to build a model that accounts for all possible relationships between variables, we need to ensure that we don't have any redundancies in the model. One simple way to do this is to run an ACF test to detect any autocorrelation patterns among the variables. If any pattern exists, we should eliminate the corresponding variable from the model. We also plot the correlation matrix to visualize the relationships between variables and identify redundant variables that need to be removed.

4. Build the linear regression model: Once we have eliminated redundant variables, we proceed with fitting the linear regression model. Here, we estimate the coefficients of the autoregressive terms (AR terms) along with their residuals. We fit these terms by minimizing the sum of squared errors between predicted and actual values. Note that we use the MLE estimation method here, which assumes the error term to be normally distributed.

5. Implement a custom RNN cell: Now, we implement a custom RNN cell using TensorFlow that takes the previous inputs and outputs as inputs to the current timestep. We pass the input data through a few fully connected layers followed by batch normalization, rectified linear unit (ReLU), and dropout functions. This produces an intermediate representation of the input data that captures the long-term temporal dependencies. The output of the RNN cell is passed through another dense layer with softmax activation function, which gives us the probability distribution over all the classes/labels in the dataset.

6. Train the network: After building the CNN architecture, we train the network using mini-batch gradient descent and backpropagation. During training, we monitor the loss function and adjust the weights of the network accordingly. We use early stopping to prevent overfitting and use regularization techniques such as dropout and L2 norm constraint to improve the stability and accuracy of the model. Additionally, we perform Bayesian optimization to tune the hyperparameters of the network automatically based on the available resources and feedback obtained during training.

7. Generate forecasts: Finally, once the model is trained and tuned, we generate forecasts for the remaining horizon by feeding the last n values of the time series and predicting the nth value. We repeat this process iteratively to obtain longer-term forecasts.

# 4. Detailed Code Implementation
To implement the above mentioned method, we need to install the necessary libraries, download the time series data, preprocess it, define the model architecture, and finally train the model. Let's walk through the Python code for this purpose. 

First, let's import the necessary packages. Tensorflow and Pytorch are the most commonly used frameworks for implementing neural networks. Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib are helpful tools for preprocessing, visualizing, and analyzing the data.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import torch
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
```

Next, we load the time series data from CSV file and explore it.

```python
data = pd.read_csv("time_series_data.csv")
print(data.head()) # print the top five rows of the dataset
print(data.shape) # number of rows and columns in the dataset
```

We normalize the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. This ensures that all variables have zero mean and unit variance.

```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data.values)
```

Then, we separate the dependent and independent variables.

```python
X = scaled_data[:, :-1] # all rows and up to second last column
y = scaled_data[:, -1][:, None] # only the last column, converted to a vertical array
```

We then perform ACF test to detect any autocorrelation patterns and visualize the correlation matrix. If any pattern exists, we should eliminate the corresponding variable from the model. We also plot the correlation matrix to visualize the relationships between variables and identify redundant variables that need to be removed.

```python
acf_results = acf(X, nlags=20) # calculate the ACF coefficients for lags up to 20
plt.plot(np.arange(len(acf_results)), acf_results) # plot the ACF results
plt.xlabel('Lag')
plt.ylabel('ACF coefficient')
plt.show()

corr_matrix = np.corrcoef(X.T) # compute the correlation matrix
plt.imshow(corr_matrix, cmap='hot', interpolation='nearest'); plt.colorbar(); 
plt.title('Correlation Matrix')
plt.xticks(range(len(X[0])), X[0].columns); plt.yticks(range(len(X[0])), X[0].columns)
plt.show()
```

Based on the plots, we see that there seems to be no strong autocorrelation pattern among the variables. So, we continue with creating the linear regression model.

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model import ARMA
def fit_arma_model(y):
    """Fit an ARMA(p, q) model to y"""
    best_aic = float('inf')
    p = q = maxlag = 0
    
    for i in range(1, 6):
        for j in range(i):
            try:
                model = ARMA(y, order=(i,j))
                res = model.fit(disp=-1)
                
                if res.aic < best_aic:
                    best_aic = res.aic
                    p = i
                    q = j
                    
                if p == i and q == j:
                    break
                    
            except:
                continue

    return ARMA(y, order=(p,q)).fit(disp=False)
```

Here, we loop through different combinations of p and q values and fit an ARMA(p, q) model to the time series data. We keep track of the model with minimum Akaike information criterion (AIC) value. We extract the p and q values from the selected model and use them later to fit the CNN model.

```python
ar_model = fit_arma_model(y)
resid = ar_model.resid # get the residuals after performing AR decomposition
sigma_squared = np.var(resid)**0.5 # calculate the variance of the residuals

ar_params = list(ar_model.params) + [sigma_squared] # concatenate the AR parameters and variance
ar_weights = np.array([1]) # initialize the AR weights array with zeros
for param in reversed(ar_params[:-1]):
    ar_weights = np.r_[param*ar_weights, [1]] # update the AR weights using recursive formula
    
coefs = {} # dictionary to store the AR coefficients
for i in range(len(ar_weights)):
    coefs['ar{}'.format(i+1)] = float(ar_weights[i]/sigma_squared**0.5) # convert the AR weights to coefficients
    
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.stem(range(len(coefs)+1), ar_weights/sigma_squared**0.5, markerfmt=' ')
ax.set_title('Auto-regressive coefficients')
ax.set_xlabel('Coefficient Index')
ax.set_ylabel('Coefficient Value')
plt.show()
```

Let's now build the CNN model using Keras library. We start by importing the necessary modules. Then, we define the custom RNN cell using the Sequential API.

```python
from keras.layers import Input, Dense, Flatten, Conv1D, MaxPooling1D, BatchNormalization, Dropout, LSTMCell, Lambda
from keras.regularizers import l2
from keras.optimizers import Adam
from kerastuner import HyperModel
from kerastuner.tuners import RandomSearch
from tensorflow.keras.initializers import Constant
from collections import OrderedDict
from bayes_opt import BayesianOptimization

class CustomHyperModel(HyperModel):
    def __init__(self, num_classes, lstm_units):
        self.num_classes = num_classes
        self.lstm_units = lstm_units
        
    def build(self, hp):
        init = Constant(value=0.01)
        
        # Create input layer 
        input_layer = Input(shape=(None, len(X[0])))
        
        # Add LSTM layer with hyperparameter search space
        x = input_layer
        x = LSTMCell(hp.Int('lstm_cells', min_value=32, max_value=256, step=32))(x)

        # Add FC layers with hyperparameter search space
        fc_layers = []
        for i in range(hp.Int('fc_layers', min_value=1, max_value=3, step=1)):
            fc_layers.append(Dense(hp.Int('fc_neurons_' + str(i), min_value=32, max_value=128, step=32), activation='relu')(x))
            
        # Output layer
        output_layer = Dense(self.num_classes, activation='softmax')(fc_layers[-1])

        model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=[input_layer], outputs=[output_layer])
        
        opt = Adam(lr=hp.Choice('learning_rate', values=[1e-3, 1e-4]))
        model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=opt, metrics=['accuracy'])
        
        return model
    

def objective(hyperparameters, epochs=10, verbose=1, val_split=0.1):
    """Objective function for tuning hyperparameters."""
    hypermodel = CustomHyperModel(num_classes=1, lstm_units=128)
    random_search = RandomSearch(
        hypermodel,
        objective='val_accuracy',
        max_trials=10,
        executions_per_trial=2,
        directory='random_search',
        project_name='arima_cnn'
    )
    
    random_search.search(x=X,
                         y=tf.one_hot(np.squeeze(y, axis=-1), depth=1),
                         epochs=epochs,
                         validation_split=val_split,
                         callbacks=[],
                         verbose=verbose)
    
    trials = random_search.get_best_trials(num_trials=1)[0]
    hyperparameters = {k:v for k, v in zip(['lstm_cells'] + ['fc_neurons_'+str(i) for i in range(len(fc_layers))] + ['learning_rate'],
                                            [[int(x) for x in s.strip().replace('[','').replace(']','').split(',')] for s in trials.hyperparameters.values()] + [trials.score])}
    return {'loss': -trials.score,'status': STATUS_OK,'model': hyperparameters}

```

This defines a custom hypermodel for the CNN architecture with a randomly chosen number of LSTM cells and hidden neurons per fully connected layer, as well as a choice of learning rate. We compile the model with categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer. We use Bayesian Optimization to tune the hyperparameters of the model using a custom objective function.

Finally, we call the `objective` function to tune the hyperparameters of the model and save the best configuration. We use ten random samples from the parameter space for searching and evaluate each sample twice to reduce the chance of getting stuck in local optima.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    bo = BayesianOptimization(objective,
                              {'lstm_cells': (32, 256),
                               'fc_layers': (1, 3),
                               'fc_neurons_0': (32, 128),
                               'fc_neurons_1': (32, 128),
                               'fc_neurons_2': (32, 128),
                               'learning_rate': (1e-3, 1e-4)},
                              random_state=42)
    bo.maximize(n_iter=20, alpha=1e-3)
    best_config = bo.max["params"]
```

Once we have found the optimal configuration, we can instantiate the model and train it on the full dataset.

```python
model = CustomHyperModel(num_classes=1, lstm_units=128)(best_config)
history = model.fit(X, tf.one_hot(np.squeeze(y, axis=-1), depth=1), epochs=100, validation_split=0.1)
```

After training, we can visualize the training curves to check whether the model converges to a good solution and performs well on the validation set.

```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=1)
axs[0].plot(history.history['loss'], label='train')
axs[0].plot(history.history['val_loss'], label='validation')
axs[0].legend()
axs[0].set_title('Loss curve')

axs[1].plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='train')
axs[1].plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='validation')
axs[1].legend()
axs[1].set_title('Accuracy curve')
plt.show()
```

If the training curves look good, we can generate forecasts for the remaining horizon.

```python
future_dates = pd.date_range(start='2021-01-01', end='2021-12-31', freq='MS')[:horizon]
forecasts = []
for date in future_dates:
    pred = model.predict(np.expand_dims(X[-1,:],axis=0))[0,:] * std + mu
    forecasts.append(pred)
    X = np.concatenate((X, pred.reshape(-1,1)))
        
df_forecasts = pd.DataFrame({'Date': future_dates, 'Forecasts': forecasts})
df_forecasts['Actuals'] = df_forecasts.apply(lambda row: y[(df_forecasts['Date'] <= row['Date']).idxmax()], axis=1)
df_forecasts[['Date', 'Actuals', 'Forecasts']].plot(figsize=(15,5))
plt.grid()
plt.title('Predictions vs Actuals')
plt.show()
```

We combine the historical data, forecasts, and actual values into a DataFrame and plot them against each other to assess the accuracy of the model.
