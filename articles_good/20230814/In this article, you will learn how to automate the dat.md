Data Cleaning is an important part of any Data Science project as it helps to ensure that the data has consistent and accurate information. It involves a series of tasks such as removing missing values, handling duplicates, identifying outliers and anomalies, transforming columns into appropriate formats, and normalizing the dataset to eliminate redundancy.

Pandas and Open Refine are two popular tools used for data cleaning purposes which provide powerful functionality but they require some level of technical expertise to operate them effectively. Therefore, automating these processes through scripting languages like Python provides a more efficient approach to achieving the same result. 

In this article, we will discuss different approaches to performing data cleaning automation using Pandas and Open Refine. We will also explain the concept of error detection and correction techniques and apply them on a sample dataset to understand their practical application.

2.Basic concepts and terminology 
Before proceeding further, let's briefly introduce some basic terms and concepts related to data cleaning: 

 - **Raw data** refers to the uncleansed data obtained from various sources including databases, files, etc., before processing.
 - **Cleaned data** refers to the final output after processing and cleaning the raw data. 
 - **Data quality** represents the degree of accuracy and completeness of the data. It includes issues such as missing values, incorrect formatting, duplicate records, inconsistencies within the data, and erroneous values. 
 - **Outlier Detection** refers to identifying extreme values outside the expected range or distribution of the data. Outliers may indicate wrong input, measurement errors, or other problems with the data collection procedures. 

We will use the following example dataset to demonstrate our automated data cleaning method:

| Name       | Age | Gender | Salary   | Job Title      | Company Name     | Contact Number    | Email Address              | Website               |
|------------|-----|--------|----------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| John Doe   | 30  | Male   | $75,000  | Software Engineer | Google Inc.      | +91-123-456-7890  | johndoe@gmail.com          | www.johndoecompany.com |
| Jane Smith | 35  | Female | $65,000  | Manager         | Microsoft Corp. | +91-987-654-3210  | janesmith@outlook.com      | www.janesmithexperience.net |
| Alex Lee   | 25  | Male   | $85,000  | CEO             | Amazon Inc.      | +91-555-555-5555 | alxllee@yahoo.co.in        | n/a                   |
| Tim Brown  | 32  | Male   | $80,000  | CFO             | Apple Inc.       | +91-234-567-8901 | tbrown@hotmail.com        | n/a                   |

The above table contains details about four employees who have been given unique names, ages, genders, salaries, job titles, company names, contact numbers, email addresses, and website URLs. The goal of our data cleaning task is to clean up this messy data so that it can be utilized for analysis. 

3.Algorithm and operations
Now, let's move onto the core algorithm and operation steps involved in our data cleaning process. Here's what needs to be done:

1. Import necessary libraries
   ```python
   import pandas as pd 
   import numpy as np 
   import re 
   from fuzzywuzzy import process #to perform fuzzy matching for similar strings
   from difflib import SequenceMatcher #to compare similarity between two strings
   
   ```
   
2. Load the CSV file containing the initial data

   ``` python
   df = pd.read_csv('employee_data.csv') 
   ```
   
3. Detect and remove empty rows 
   
    One common problem in real-world data sets is having empty lines or rows that do not contain relevant information. To handle such cases, we need to identify those empty rows and drop them from our data set.

    We can achieve this by checking if all cells in each row are NaN (not a number) using the `isnull()` function provided by Pandas. If all cells in a row are NaN, then it should be dropped from our data frame.
    
    ```python
    df.dropna(how='all', inplace=True) #drop empty rows
    ```
    
4. Identify missing values 

    Missing values occur due to different reasons such as data loss during transmission, software errors while collecting data, or incomplete user inputs. However, since our goal is to minimize errors caused by invalid data entries, we must first identify the location and type of missing values in our data set. 
    
    We can easily check for missing values using the `isnull()` function provided by Pandas along with the sum() function. If the resulting count of NaN values for a column is greater than zero, then there is at least one missing value in that column. We can replace these missing values with suitable replacement values based on the nature of the data collected. For example, if the salary of an employee is unknown, we can replace it with the median salary of the employer's department. 
    
    ```python
    null_counts = df.isnull().sum()
    cols_with_missing_values = [col for col in df.columns if null_counts[col] > 0]
    print("Columns with missing values:", cols_with_missing_values)
    
    ``` 
    
5. Handle Duplicate Records 

    Duplicates are instances where multiple occurrences of identical data exist within a data set. They can arise either because of manual entry mistakes or natural duplicates generated by data capturing devices. While duplicates impact the overall performance of the analysis, it may also cause bias and affect the validity of the results. 
    
    To identify duplicates, we can use the `duplicated()` function provided by Pandas. It returns boolean values indicating whether each record appears only once (`False`) or more than once (`True`). Based on these flags, we can select only those records that are duplicated and remove the others.
    
    ```python
    dup_rows = df.duplicated()
    duplicate_records = df[dup_rows == True]
    non_duplicate_records = df[dup_rows == False]
    
    ``` 

6. Remove Invalid Entries 

    Another potential source of errors in our data set is invalid entries that cannot be interpreted correctly. For instance, some numerical fields might contain text characters instead of actual numeric values. Similarly, date fields might contain malformed dates or timestamps that cannot be parsed correctly. 
    
    Since we want to maintain consistency and accuracies in our data set, we need to find ways to filter out such entries without disturbing the integrity of the data. One way to accomplish this is to define regular expressions patterns for specific types of fields and validate the corresponding columns against these patterns. 
    
    ```python
    def valid_age(x):
        try:
            int(x)
            return True
        except ValueError:
            return False
        
    def valid_salary(x):
        pattern = r'\$([\d\,\.]+)' 
        match = re.search(pattern, x)
        
        if match: 
            return True
        else:
            return False
        
     
    df['Age'] = df['Age'].apply(valid_age)
    df['Salary'] = df['Salary'].apply(valid_salary)
    
    invalid_records = df[(df['Age']==False)|(df['Salary']==False)]
    cleaned_data = df[(df['Age']==True)&(df['Salary']==True)]
    
    ```
   
7. Normalize Strings 

    Textual data often requires additional preprocessing to convert it into a standard format that can be analyzed and understood. One technique commonly used in text mining applications is to normalize string variables by converting them into lowercase or uppercase letters. Normalization ensures that words that look alike receive the same representation throughout the corpus. This step improves the efficiency of subsequent analysis by reducing the chances of overlooking significant differences. 
    
    ```python
    normalized_data = []
    
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        name = str(row['Name']).lower()
        gender = str(row['Gender']).lower()
        job_title = str(row['Job Title']).lower()
        company_name = str(row['Company Name']).lower()
        contact_number = str(row['Contact Number'])
        email_address = str(row['Email Address']).lower()
        website = str(row['Website']).lower()

        new_record = {'Name':name, 'Age':row['Age'], 'Gender':gender, 'Salary':row['Salary'],
                      'Job Title':job_title, 'Company Name':company_name, 'Contact Number':contact_number,
                       'Email Address':email_address, 'Website':website}

        normalized_data.append(new_record)
        
    norm_df = pd.DataFrame(normalized_data)
        
    ``` 

8. Handle Anomalies 

    Lastly, we need to deal with anomalies or outliers that deviate significantly from the general behavior or trends of the data. These points typically represent extreme values or exceptions that may influence the statistical analysis of the data incorrectly. While they don't necessarily constitute big issues in small data sets, they can lead to unexpected results when dealing with larger ones. 
    
    To identify anomalies, we can leverage the z-score method which computes the difference between a point and its mean divided by its standard deviation. Points with a z-score greater than three or less than negative three are considered anomalies. Once identified, we can decide whether to exclude them from our analysis or impute them with reasonable values. 
    
    ```python
    def z_score(column):
        threshold = 3
        
        mean = np.mean(column)
        std_dev = np.std(column)
        scores = [(value - mean)/std_dev for value in column]
        return scores
    
    zscores = {}
    
    for col in ['Age','Salary']:
        zscores[col] = z_score(norm_df[col])
        
    score_list = list(zscores.values())
    flattened_list = [item for sublist in score_list for item in sublist]
    outliers = []
    for i, value in enumerate(flattened_list):
        if abs(value)>threshold:
            outliers.append((i//len(norm_df), i%len(norm_df)))
            
    anomalies = set([str(index)+","+str(column) for index, column in outliers])
        
    ```

    
Putting everything together, here's the script that performs automatic data cleaning using Pandas and Open Refine: 


``` python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import re
from fuzzywuzzy import process
from difflib import SequenceMatcher


def z_score(column):
    threshold = 3
    
    mean = np.mean(column)
    std_dev = np.std(column)
    scores = [(value - mean)/std_dev for value in column]
    return scores

def valid_age(x):
    try:
        int(x)
        return True
    except ValueError:
        return False
    
def valid_salary(x):
    pattern = r'\$([\d|,]+(\.\d\d)?)' 
    match = re.search(pattern, x)
    
    if match: 
        return True
    else:
        return False

def clean_data(file_path):
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    
    #detect empty rows and remove them
    df.dropna(how='all', inplace=True)
    
    #identify missing values and fill them using median or average values
    cols_with_missing_values = [col for col in df.columns if df[col].isnull().sum()>0]
    for col in cols_with_missing_values:
        if col=='Salary' or col=='Age':
            df[col].fillna(df[col].median(),inplace=True)
        elif col=='Contact Number':
            df[col].fillna('+91-',inplace=True)
        else:
            df[col].fillna('',inplace=True)
    
    #remove duplicate records
    dup_rows = df.duplicated()
    duplicate_records = df[dup_rows==True]
    non_duplicate_records = df[dup_rows==False]
    df = non_duplicate_records
    
    #validate age and salary fields using regex patterns
    df['Age'] = df['Age'].apply(lambda x: valid_age(x))
    df['Salary'] = df['Salary'].apply(lambda x: valid_salary(x))
    
    #normalize string fields
    normalized_data = []
    
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        name = str(row['Name']).lower()

        contact_number = str(row['Contact Number'])
        email_address = str(row['Email Address']).lower()
        website = str(row['Website']).lower()

        new_record = {'Name':name, 'Age':row['Age'], 'Gender':gender, 'Salary':row['Salary'],
                      'Job Title':job_title, 'Company Name':company_name, 'Contact Number':contact_number,
                       'Email Address':email_address, 'Website':website}

        normalized_data.append(new_record)
        
    norm_df = pd.DataFrame(normalized_data)
    
    #find anomalies and handle them accordingly

    anomalies_df = pd.DataFrame({'Anomaly Index':outliers}).set_index(['Anomaly Index'])
    
    corrected_data = []
    
    for index, row in norm_df.iterrows():
        corrected_row = row.copy()
        
        if ','.join(map(str, index)) in anomalies:
            continue
        
        for anomaly in anomalies:
            splitted_anomaly = anomaly.split(",")
            
            if index[0]==int(splitted_anomaly[0]):
                corrected_row[int(splitted_anomaly[1])] *= 1.05
