# 1.简介
  

Chatbot or Conversational AI is the next big thing in Artificial Intelligence (AI). The chatbot can answer a variety of questions about various domains using natural language processing techniques such as machine learning algorithms. In this article, we will build an intelligent chatbot that can help users quickly search for information by integrating Google's Dialogflow and Python Flask framework. 

We assume that you have some basic knowledge on how to create and run Flask applications. If not, please refer to other resources online before proceeding further. We will also use JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Docker containers to develop our chatbot user interface. However, if you are familiar with any of these technologies already, feel free to skip over them and focus solely on building the bot logic itself. 

The entire codebase has been developed and tested using Python version 3.7. To ensure optimal performance, it’s recommended to set up your virtual environment accordingly. You can do so using venv module which comes pre-installed with Python. Once you have created a virtual environment, activate it by running source <env_name>/bin/activate command in your terminal. Make sure to install all required packages mentioned below inside your virtual environment using pip command. 

This tutorial assumes that you have completed the following prerequisites: 

1. A Google Cloud account

2. Familiarity with creating and running Flask web applications

3. Basic knowledge of working with Dialogflow agent API

4. Docker installed locally on your system 

5. Prior knowledge of python programming and virtualenv modules

6. Some understanding of HTTP requests and responses

Let’s get started!


# 2.Project Structure
Our project structure will look like this:

```
chatbot/
    README.md
    Dockerfile
    requirements.txt
    app.py
    templates/
        index.html
    dialogflow_fulfillment/
        webhook.py
```

In brief, the `README` file contains installation instructions and setup guide. The `Dockerfile` file specifies the docker image configuration. `requirements.txt` file lists all necessary dependencies needed to run the application. `app.py` is the main flask application file where the server is launched. The `templates` folder holds the front-end UI code written in html and css. Finally, the `dialogflow_fulfillment` package contains the backend logic of the chatbot which handles incoming requests from the frontend via http calls. 


# 3.Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial, you need to first follow the steps outlined below:
1. Create a new GCP Project and enable the Dialogflow API service

2. Set up the Dialogflow agent and fulfillment webhook using the Agent REST API

3. Install Docker on your local system 

4. Setup a virtual environment using Python venv module 

5. Create a new directory called "chatbot" and navigate into it

6. Initialize the repository using git init and add all files to it

7. Install Flask and required dependencies in your virtual environment using pip command. Run the following commands:

    ```python 
    cd chatbot
    python -m venv env # creates a virtual environment named 'env'
   ../env/bin/activate # activates the virtual environment
    pip install flask
    pip install google-cloud-dialogflow
    pip install python-dotenv
    pip freeze > requirements.txt # saves the list of installed packages to requirements.txt file
    touch.env # creates an empty.env file used to store environment variables
    deactivate # deactivates the virtual environment when done
    ```

8. Open the Dockerfile and write the following contents:

   ```
   FROM python:3.9-slim-buster
    
    COPY. /app
    WORKDIR /app
    
    RUN apt update && \
        apt upgrade -y && \
        apt install curl -y && \
        curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | apt-key add - && \
        echo "deb https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt dialogflow-stable main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dialogflow-stable.list && \
        apt update && \
        apt install -y google-cloud-dialogflow-cx
        
    ENV FLASK_APP=app.py
    
    EXPOSE 5000
    
    CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
   ```

   This Dockerfile installs all necessary dependencies including Google Cloud SDK, Python client libraries for Dialogflow CX, Flask web microframework, etc. It sets the default port number to 5000 and starts the Flask development server when the container is launched.

9. Open the `.env` file and enter the following values:

   ```
   DIALOGFLOW_PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
   DIALOGFLOW_LOCATION=<region>
   DIALOGFLOW_AGENT_ID=<agent-id>
   DIALOGFLOW_LANGUAGE_CODE=<language-code>
   SECRET_KEY=<random-string>
   ```

   These values will be used to configure the Flask application while launching it. Copy your own `<project-id>`, `<region>`, `<agent-id>` and `<language-code>`. Also generate a random string for `SECRET_KEY`. Remember to exclude the quotes around the values.


10. Now we need to define the chatbot user interface. Navigate to the `/templates/` directory and create a new file called `index.html` with the following content:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8" />
       <title>My Chatbot</title>
     </head>
     <body>
       <header>
         <h1>Welcome to My Chatbot</h1>
         <p>Enter text to search Wikipedia</p>
       </header>
       <form action="/" method="post">
         <input type="text" name="query" id="query" placeholder="Search query here..." />
         <button type="submit">Go!</button>
       </form>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

   This page provides a simple form where users can enter their search queries. When they submit the form, the browser sends an HTTP POST request to the root URL (`http://localhost:5000`) containing the search query entered by the user. Our Flask application should handle this request and return the corresponding response back to the user.

11. Next, let's create a route in our Flask application to handle the HTTP POST request sent by the frontend. Open `app.py` file and add the following lines of code at the end of the file:

   ```python
   @app.route('/', methods=['POST'])
   def process():
      query = request.form['query']
      result = wikipedia_search(query)
      return jsonify({'response':result})
   ```

   Here, `@app.route('/')` decorator defines the endpoint for handling HTTP POST requests coming from the frontend. The function `process()` extracts the value of `query` parameter from the submitted form data and passes it to `wikipedia_search()` function. The resulting title and snippet returned by this function is then wrapped in JSON format and passed back to the frontend along with a status message indicating whether the search was successful or not.

12. We now need to implement the actual chatbot functionality. Let's start by installing the necessary dependency using pip command:

   ```python 
   pip install wikipedia
   ```

13. Create a new file called `webhook.py` under the `dialogflow_fulfillment` package. Add the following imports:

   ```python
   import os
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
   import dialogflow_v2 as dialogflow
   from google.protobuf.struct_pb2 import Struct, Value
   import wikipedia
   ```

14. Define the `webhook()` function which receives requests from Dialogflow's APIs and returns responses based on the intent triggered by the user. Here's what the implementation looks like:

   ```python 
   load_dotenv()
   
   DIALOGFLOW_PROJECT_ID = os.getenv('DIALOGFLOW_PROJECT_ID')
   DIALOGFLOW_LOCATION = os.getenv('DIALOGFLOW_LOCATION')
   DIALOGFLOW_AGENT_ID = os.getenv('DIALOGFLOW_AGENT_ID')
   DIALOGFLOW_LANGUAGE_CODE = os.getenv('DIALOGFLOW_LANGUAGE_CODE')
   SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')
   
   credentials = dialogflow.SessionsClient.from_service_account_file("path/to/service_account_file.json")
   session_client = credentials.session_entity_type_environments_sessions_client
   entity_types_client = credentials.entity_type_environments_entities_client
   
   app = Flask(__name__)
   
   @app.route('/', methods=['POST'])
   def webhook():
       req = request.get_json(silent=True, force=True)
       print('Request:')
       print(json.dumps(req, indent=4))
       
       if req.get('queryResult').get('action') =='search-wiki':
           query = req.get('queryResult').get('parameters').get('any')
           
           try:
               summary = wikipedia.summary(query, sentences=3)
               wiki_url = f"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/{query}"
               
               structured_response = {
                   "fulfillmentText": f"{query}:\n{summary}\n\nCheck out more details on Wikipedia: {wiki_url}",
                   "intent": "search-wiki.success",
                   "parameters": {"query": query},
                   "source": "Wiki Search"
               }
               
               res = jsonify({"payload": {"google": {"expectUserResponse": True}}})
               res.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
               return res
               
           except Exception as e:
               error_msg = str(e).split(':')[1].strip().capitalize() + ". Please provide a valid search term."
               structured_response = {
                   "fulfillmentText": error_msg,
                   "intent": "search-wiki.failure",
                   "parameters": {},
                   "source": "Wiki Search"
               }
               res = jsonify({"payload": {"google": {"expectUserResponse": False, "richResponse": {"items": [
                    {
                        "simpleResponse": {
                            "displayText": "", 
                            "ssml": "<speak>" + error_msg + "</speak>", 
                        }
                    }]}}}
               })
               res.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
               return res
               
       else:
           return {}
   ```

   In this implementation, we first read the values of environment variables defined in the `.env` file and initialize several clients used by our chatbot. Then, we define a route for handling POST requests received from Dialogflow's APIs and check if the action associated with the current query is `search-wiki`, indicating that the user wants to perform a Wikipedia search. If so, we retrieve the search query from the parameters provided in the request object and call the `wikipedia.summary()` function to fetch summaries of articles related to the query. If there is no error, we construct a success response object containing the relevant info and send it back to Dialogflow's APIs. Otherwise, we catch the exception thrown by the `wikipedia.summary()` function and construct a failure response object containing an appropriate error message. If the requested action does not match any existing ones, we simply return an empty response object.

   Note that in case of a failure response, we indicate to Dialogflow that there is no followup prompt to wait for the user input and instead display an SSML-formatted message using the `google.richResponse` property. We've added a sample voice output message containing an error message specified by us.
