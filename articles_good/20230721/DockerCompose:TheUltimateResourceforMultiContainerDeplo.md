Docker 是一种流行的开源容器虚拟化技术，它可以轻松创建、部署、运行多个应用程序容器在同一个主机上。虽然单个容器足够满足开发测试的需求，但当需要实现更复杂的多容器应用时，就需要考虑如何将这些容器组合成一个整体，并协调它们之间的交互关系。

Compose 是 Docker 提供的一款用来定义和运行多容器应用的工具，其设计目的是通过一个 YAML 文件来配置要运行的服务，然后自动启动并关联所有相关的容器。

虽然 Compose 可以轻松地定义、管理、编排多个容器，但是作为最佳实践来说，还是有一些需要注意的问题需要了解。本文将从以下三个方面进行阐述：

1. Compose 简介
2. Compose 的功能与优点
3. Compose 的使用场景及限制

# 2. Docker Compose 简介
## 2.1 What is Docker Compose? 

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you define a single configuration file to start multiple services, and then use a single command to create and start all the containers.

Compose uses a simple syntax for defining both the services and their dependencies. This makes it easy to understand and configure complex applications consisting of many services. You can set parameters like image versions, environment variables, ports, and volumes for each service, and link them together so that they communicate with each other seamlessly.

Compose is great for development environments, continuous integration (CI) workflows, and automated testing. By using Compose, you can quickly stand up and tear down complex environments as needed.

Compose is open source and available on GitHub under the Apache License version 2.0.

## 2.2 Why Use Docker Compose? 

Here are some reasons why you might want to use Docker Compose instead of just running individual container commands manually or with a scripting language:

1. Simplified Configuration: With Compose, you don't need to remember the individual `docker run` commands for each container. Instead, you declare the overall application architecture in a single file called `docker-compose.yml`, which includes everything from which images to use, how many copies of each container to run, and any shared volumes between them.

2. Encapsulation: Composition gives you better control over your application's environment by abstracting away the individual containers. This means you can upgrade or rollback an entire stack of services at once, without affecting the rest of your infrastructure.

3. Reproducibility: Docker Compose allows you to build an application entirely from scratch by simply rebuilding its configuration. This ensures that you're building exactly what you test in CI, rather than having to worry about whether your local setup matches production.

4. Scalability: Docker Compose makes scaling a distributed application much easier than manually managing the replicated processes for each container. Just add more instances of a given service in your `docker-compose.yml` file, and run `docker-compose up --scale SERVICE=NUM` to scale it.

5. Caching: Docker Compose takes advantage of image layer caching to reduce the amount of time required to rebuild and deploy your application. When you change a line of code in your project, only that layer needs to be rebuilt and pushed, leading to faster deployment times.

By using Docker Compose, you can get a lot of these benefits for free while still maintaining full flexibility and control over your application's environment.

## 2.3 How Does Docker Compose Work? 

When you tell Compose to start your app, it reads your `docker-compose.yml` file and starts each container defined therein. If any linked services are not already running, Compose also starts those before starting the current one. For example:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build:.
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    links:
      - redis

  redis:
    image: "redis:latest"
```

This would pull the `web` image if no matching image was found locally, build it from the Dockerfile in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml`, expose port 5000, and link to a Redis instance running elsewhere named `redis`.

Once the containers have started, Compose handles networking, volume mounts, and environment variables between them as specified in the config file. Finally, any exposed ports are made accessible on the host machine, allowing you to access the application at `http://localhost:5000/`.

## 2.4 Compose File Format Version 3 Reference

The Compose file format specifies a strict subset of the YAML syntax. This lets you write clean and readable config files that are easy to parse and validate. Here's a reference of every possible option available in Compose file format version 3:

### 2.4.1 version

Specify the version of the Compose file format being used. Currently, the only valid value is "3".

Example:

```yaml
version: '3'
```

### 2.4.2 services

Define the services that will be created and run as part of the application stack. Each service definition consists of a name and configuration options that specify how to run the container. Multiple service definitions can be placed in this section, allowing you to easily scale your app by adding more services. Services can either be defined in the top level of the file, or in separate `.yml` files and referenced here.

Available options include:

 * `image`: the image name to use for the container
 * `build`: specify build context path and optional Dockerfile filename, or alternatively a URL to a Git repository containing a Dockerfile
 * `command`: override the default command for the container
 * `ports`: map exposed ports to the host interface
 * `volumes`: define paths in the container that should be mounted as data volumes
 * `depends_on`: specify which services must be started prior to this one
 * `environment`: set environment variables inside the container

Example:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    # Use the latest version of the node image from the Docker Hub registry.
    image: node:latest

    # Build the container from the current working directory's Dockerfile.
    build:
      context:./my-app
      dockerfile: Dockerfile-alt

    # Override the default command.
    command: node server.js

    # Expose port 3000 on the container and forward it to port 3000 on the host.
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    
    # Mount the./data folder as a volume and give it permissions for MySQL.
    volumes:
      -./data:/var/lib/mysql
      - /path/to/static:/var/www/html/public

    # Link the mysql service to this service.
    depends_on: 
      - db

  db:
    image: mysql:latest
    volumes:
      -./db:/var/lib/mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret
```

### 2.4.3 networks

Networks can be used to connect multiple services together within the same stack, even if they are in different containers. Networks share a similar concept to the way a computer network shares a common subnet. A network can have multiple associated containers and can be configured with various network driver plugins such as bridge, overlay, etc., depending on your requirements. To define networks, use the following syntax:

Example:

```yaml
networks:
  frontend:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      driver: default
      config:
        - subnet: 192.168.0.0/24
          gateway: 192.168.0.100
  backend:
    external: true
```

In this example, we've defined two networks: `frontend` and `backend`. We're using the built-in bridge plugin for our `frontend` network, and we've defined an IP address range and gateway for it. The `backend` network is externally managed via an external key, meaning it exists outside of the Compose environment and won't be automatically removed when you stop and remove the Compose application. 

### 2.4.4 volumes

Volumes allow you to persist data across container recreations. Define volumes with the `volumes` directive, giving it a unique name and specifying where on the host filesystem you want to store the data. Volume names must be unique within a single Docker Compose project, but may collide with the name of another volume defined in another Docker Compose file or on the host system. To define volumes, use the following syntax:

Example:

```yaml
volumes:
  mydatavolume: {}
  mystoragevolume:
    driver: glusterfs
    driver_opts:
      backup-volfile-servers: 172.20.100.11,172.20.100.12
      volsize: 1G
```

In this example, we've defined two volumes: `mydatavolume` and `mystoragevolume`. Both types of volumes can be mapped into containers as volumes, making it easy to keep state around across container restarts. We're also specifying additional details for the `mystoragevolume` volume, including the `glusterfs` driver type and custom driver options.

### 2.4.5 secrets

Secrets let you securely pass sensitive data such as passwords, keys, and certificates to your services. Secrets are stored separately from the Docker Compose file, alongside other configuration data. You can load the values of secrets into environment variables or directly into container configurations using a template placeholder (`${SECRET}`). To define secrets, use the following syntax:

Example:

```yaml
secrets:
  mysecret:
    file:./secret.txt
  myothersecret:
    external: true
```

In this example, we've defined two secrets: `mysecret` and `myothersecret`. `mysecret` is defined using a relative filepath to a file on disk, while `myothersecret` references an existing secret declared elsewhere in the system.

Note: Secrets were introduced in Docker Engine v1.13 and API version 1.25.
