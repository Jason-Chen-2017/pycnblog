## 一、概述
### 1.1 Transformer
Transformer是一种用于序列到序列(sequence to sequence, seq2seq)学习任务的最新网络结构。它借鉴了自注意力机制(self attention mechanism)，并在编码器-解码器结构上进行修改。Transformer的优点是通过关注每个位置的上下文来捕获长期依赖关系，因此能够处理序列中出现的复杂模式，同时保持计算效率。此外，Transformer也被证明可以有效地学习序列特征并生成新序列。

### 1.2 BERT
BERT，全称Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers，是一种基于预训练语言模型的方法，其提出者<NAME>等人于2018年8月发布。BERT将注意力层分为前向和后向两个部分，分别对输入句子和输出句子进行建模。其中，编码器采用的是双向Transformer，而解码器则是单向的Transformer。BERT相比于传统的词嵌入方法，能够自动学习到更丰富的上下文信息。同时，通过预训练任务加强了BERT的性能。

# [2] Visualizing Transformer Layers for Deep Learning
# Introduction

One of the most common and powerful architecture used in deep learning is called a "Transformer". It was introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017), which builds on ideas from previous architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). In this article, we will explore how transformers work at a high level and discuss some key concepts about them, including the idea of Attention and Multi-Head Attention layers. We'll also look into the specific use cases of these components within transformers, and provide code examples that demonstrate their usage. Finally, we'll talk about future developments and challenges with regards to using Transformers for NLP tasks and visualization tools. 

To begin, let's first take a brief tour of the basic structure of a transformer: what are its encoder and decoder blocks? What does each component do? And why do they exist? We'll answer these questions throughout the rest of our article, but here is an overview:

1. The input sentence goes through two separate embedding layers. These embeddings represent the words in the sentence using dense representations that capture semantic meaning.
2. Afterwards, it passes through one or more encoder layers. Each encoder layer consists of multiple sub-layers, including a multi-head attention layer followed by a feedforward network (FFN) layer. This allows the model to learn interactions between different positions in the sentence. 
3. Once all the information has been passed through the encoder layers, the final output representation is generated using another set of FFN layers before being sent to the decoder. 
4. The decoder receives the final representation from the encoder along with additional inputs from the output token generation process. This makes it easier for the model to generate new tokens without having to remember everything that happened in the past. The decoder then generates the next output word based on the current state of the decoder and its previously predicted words.
5. During training time, both the encoder and decoder receive ground truth labels indicating the correct output sequence. However, during inference, only the decoder is fed with the initial input context vector and iteratively generates subsequent output tokens until the stop condition is met (e.g., generating an end-of-sentence token).

So, when should you use transformers over other types of models? When can they be effective? How can we interpret the results produced by transformers? Let's dive into the details of these questions! 


# Transformer Block Structure

Before diving into deeper analysis, let's quickly review the overall structure of a transformer block. We have seen that there are two main parts to any transformer model - the encoder and decoder. Each part contains multiple stacked sub-layers. Here's a breakdown of the general layout of each sub-layer inside a transformer layer:

1. Self-Attention: This layer involves calculating pairwise relationships between elements in a sequence (the queries and keys) and applying weights to each element depending on its relevance to those around it. A scaled dot product attention function calculates the importance of each query relative to every key value pair and returns a weighted sum of the values. 

2. Residual Connection: This ensures that the original input is added back to the output of the layer to prevent the vanishing gradient problem. 

3. Normalization: This helps to make sure that the outputs of each layer do not become too large or small and helps to stabilize the model during training. 

4. Feedforward Network: This is a simple neural network that performs non-linear transformations on the inputs. 

Each sub-layer combines together several of these components to create a full transformer layer. Together, these sub-layers form a single transformer layer that processes the input data sequentially through the entire model. There are multiple copies of each transformer layer in the model to handle variable sized sequences.  

Now that we've covered the basics behind transformers, let's move onto examining individual components within them.


# Self-Attention & Multi-Headed Attention

Self-attention refers to the concept of computing a representation of an input sequence by considering the contextual relationships between its elements. Multi-headed attention is simply a type of self-attention where several heads compute independent representations of the input sequence. 

For example, consider the following question: "Given an image, identify whether it depicts a cat, dog, or human." A good way to approach this task would be to extract features from each object in the image (such as a bounding box, color histogram, etc.), concatenate them together, and train a linear classifier. While this works reasonably well for a few images, it wouldn't scale well if we had millions of labeled images to train on. Instead, we could use self-attention to define a universal feature extractor that can be applied to any image. 

In terms of implementation, self-attention involves three steps:

1. Calculating Query, Key, and Value vectors: First, the input sequence is transformed into query, key, and value vectors using weight matrices Wq, Wk, and Wv respectively. For instance, given the input sequence X = {x_1, x_2,..., x_n}, we can calculate Q, K, and V as follows:
   
   ```
   Q = Wq * x 
   K = Wk * x
   V = Wv * x
   ```

   Where * denotes matrix multiplication.

2. Calculating Attention Scores: Next, we apply a scaling factor σ to normalize the query-key similarities before softmax. Then, we calculate the attention scores as follows:

   ```
   att = σ(QK^T / sqrt(d_k))
   ```

   Where QK represents the dot product between the query vector and the key vector. Σ indicates the summation over all pairs of elements in Q and K. Note that d_k is the dimensionality of the key vectors.

3. Weighted Sum: Finally, we multiply the attention scores by the value vectors to obtain the weighted sum, which is then returned as the output:

   ```
   out = softmax(att)*V
   ```

   Softmax is used to ensure that the attention scores add up to 1 across the dimensions of the key vector.

Multi-headed attention exploits the power of parallel computation by partitioning the attention calculation among multiple heads. Specifically, each head computes its own representation of the input sequence, which are combined to produce the final output representation. The number of heads determines the degree of parallelization and the depth of the representation learned by each head. Intuitively, adding multiple heads enables the model to exploit more complex patterns in the input sequence, while still relying on a shared attention mechanism to focus on salient aspects of each element in isolation. 

With this understanding of the attention mechanism, let's now turn our attention to transformer layers themselves. 


# Transformer Layers

A transformer layer consists of multiple sub-layers, typically consisting of self-attention, residual connection, normalization, and feedforward networks. Let's go ahead and examine each of these sub-layers in detail. 

## Sub-Layer 1: Self-Attention

The first sub-layer applies multi-headed attention to the input sequence. Here's how it works:

1. Compute the query, key, and value vectors by performing linear projections of the input sequence. 
2. Apply multi-headed attention to get a fixed-dimensional representation of the input sequence. 
3. Add the input sequence to the result of step 2 to obtain the output of this sub-layer. 

This sub-layer corresponds to the green boxes in Figure 1. 

## Sub-Layer 2: Residual Connection

The second sub-layer adds the input sequence to the output of the self-attention sub-layer. This prevents the vanishing gradient problem, which occurs when the signal received at the output disappears due to the accumulation of gradients. Essentially, this sub-layer attempts to preserve the original input signal, even after passing through the self-attention sub-layer. 

Here's how it works:

1. Multiply the output of the self-attention sub-layer by a scalar parameter s.
2. Add the result of step 1 to the input sequence to obtain the output of this sub-layer.

This sub-layer corresponds to the orange arrows in Figure 1.

## Sub-Layer 3: Normalization

Normalization is performed to help maintain stable gradients during training. It involves normalizing the input sequence by subtracting its mean and dividing by its variance. This essentially forces the input distribution to be zero-centered and unit variance. 

Here's how it works:

1. Subtract the mean of the input sequence from itself.
2. Divide the resulting tensor by its standard deviation.

This sub-layer corresponds to the gray rectangles in Figure 1.

## Sub-Layer 4: Feedforward Network

The fourth sub-layer is responsible for mapping the output of the third sub-layer to a higher dimensional space. Typically, this is done using a fully connected neural network with hidden units that increase exponentially with increasing layer depth. 

Here's how it works:

1. Pass the output of the third sub-layer through two fully connected layers. 
2. Use a relu activation function on the output of the first FC layer and dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.

This sub-layer corresponds to the red squares in Figure 1.

Putting it all together, a complete transformer layer looks like this:

```
         +-----+    +------+    +--------+    +-------+    +----------+ 
Input -->|Sub1 |---->|ResAdd|--->|Norm    |--->|FwdNet |--+--> Output  
         +--+-+    +----+--    +---+----+    +-----+-+     ^
           ||                              |                 |
           ||------------------------------|-----------------+
  Multi-                    Fully Connected                     |        
Headed Atte           Weighted Sum          Activations       |        
       tion      <------------------------|                |       
                 ||                        ||                |       
                 +------------------------|---------------+      
                                      Hidden State                     
```

Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of a transformer layer containing four sub-layers: Self-Attention, Residual Connection, Normalization, and Feedforward Network. 

Note that the exact arrangement of sub-layers may vary depending on the design choices made during the model development process. Additionally, some implementations may omit certain sub-layers entirely or include variations on them. 

Let's return to our earlier discussion of attention mechanisms, and see how they're implemented within transformer layers. 


# Implementing Self-Attention and Multi-Headed Attention in PyTorch

We can implement self-attention and multi-headed attention in Python using popular libraries such as NumPy and PyTorch. Let's start by implementing self-attention. 

## Self-Attention in PyTorch

Suppose we want to perform self-attention on the input sequence Y = {y_1, y_2,..., y_n} using the query vector Q and key vector K. Here's how we can proceed:

1. Calculate the similarity score between each query element q_i and every key element k_j using the inner product operation: 
   
   ```
   e_{ij} = Q_i^T K_j
   ```

    This gives us a n*n matrix of similarity scores, where e_{ij} is the similarity score between y_i and y_j. 

2. Normalize the similarity scores by applying the softmax function: 
    
    ```
    a_{ij} = softmax(e_{ij})
    ```

    This turns the raw similarity scores into normalized attention scores, a_{ij}. Now, each row of the matrix a_{ij} sums to 1 and captures the strength of the relationship between the corresponding rows of Q and K. 

3. Calculate the weighted sum of the values given the attention scores: 
    
    ```
    v_{ij} = \sum\limits_{l=1}^n a_{il} V_l
    ```

    This takes the attention scores from the diagonal of the matrix a_{ij} and uses them to select the corresponding values in the value matrix V to calculate a weighted average. The result is a n*d matrix of weighted sums. 

Let's put this logic into a PyTorch module. 

First, import the necessary modules:

```
import torch
import numpy as np
from scipy.special import softmax
```

Next, define a class `SelfAttention` that implements self-attention:

```
class SelfAttention(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads):
        super().__init__()
        
        # Dimensionality of the query, key, and value vectors
        self.d_model = d_model
        
        # Number of heads to use
        self.num_heads = num_heads

        # Dimensions per head
        assert d_model % num_heads == 0
        self.depth = d_model // num_heads

        # Linear projections for queries, keys, and values
        self.wq = torch.nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.wk = torch.nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.wv = torch.nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)

        # Scaled dot-product attention
        self.scale = torch.sqrt(torch.FloatTensor([self.depth])).to(device)
        
    def forward(self, query, key, value):
        batch_size = query.size(0)
        
        # Perform linear projections
        qw = self.wq(query).view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.depth).transpose(1, 2)
        kw = self.wk(key).view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.depth).transpose(1, 2)
        vw = self.wv(value).view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.depth).transpose(1, 2)

        # Calculate attention scores
        ew = torch.matmul(qw, kw.transpose(-2, -1)) / self.scale

        # Get normalized attention scores
        a = nn.functional.softmax(ew, dim=-1)

        # Calculate weighted sum of values
        o = torch.matmul(a, vw)

        # Transpose the output to match the original input format
        o = o.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads * self.depth)
        
        return o
```

In this implementation, we specify the input dimensionality `d_model`, the number of heads to use `num_heads`, and derive the dimensionality of each head from this parameter. We initialize the linear projection layers for queries, keys, and values using `torch.nn.Linear`. We also store a device on which to run the calculations (`device`). 

During training, we pass the query tensor `query`, key tensor `key`, and value tensor `value` through the forward method. We reshape the tensors so that each head occupies its own dimension, i.e., `(batch_size, num_heads, len_q, depth)`. We then calculate the similarity scores `ew` using a batched matrix multiplication. We divide this by the square root of the head dimension `self.scale` to reduce the effect of the length scaling of the attention mechanism. We then apply the softmax function to get the normalized attention scores `a` over the last dimension, which correspond to the attention probabilities assigned to each element in the input sequence. Finally, we calculate the weighted sum of the values using the attention scores `a` and project them to the same shape as the input sequence to obtain the output tensor `o`. The output tensor has the shape `(batch_size, len_q, num_heads * depth)`, which matches the desired output format for multi-head attention. 

Now, let's implement the multi-head attention mechanism using self-attention. 

## Multi-Head Attention in PyTorch

Suppose we want to apply multi-head attention to the input sequence X = {x_1, x_2,..., x_n} using a query tensor Q and a key tensor K. Here's how we can proceed:

1. Split the input sequence X into chunks of size `len_q // num_chunks` for efficiency purposes. 

2. Pass each chunk through the self-attention module defined above to obtain the output of each chunk. 

3. Concatenate the output chunks to obtain the final output tensor O: 

   ```
   O = concat(outputs_chunk_1,..., outputs_chunk_n)
   ```

This approach reduces the memory footprint of the model since we don't need to allocate intermediate variables to hold all the concatenated output chunks. We can achieve the same functionality using larger batches of smaller input segments, but this requires careful configuration of hyperparameters and tradeoffs between speed and memory consumption. 

Again, let's write a PyTorch module to implement multi-head attention. 

```
class MultiHeadedAttention(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads):
        super().__init__()
        
        # Dimensionality of the query, key, and value vectors
        self.d_model = d_model
        
        # Number of heads to use
        self.num_heads = num_heads

        # Dimensions per head
        assert d_model % num_heads == 0
        self.depth = d_model // num_heads

        # Create self-attention layers
        self.attn_layers = torch.nn.ModuleList([SelfAttention(d_model, num_heads) for _ in range(num_heads)])
        
        # Final linear transformation to produce output of size d_model
        self.output_proj = torch.nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        
    def split_heads(self, x):
        batch_size = x.size(0)
        len_q = x.size(1)

        # Split the heads along the last dimension
        x = x.view(batch_size, len_q, self.num_heads, self.depth)
        
        # Swap dimensions 1 and 2 to get the correct order of dimensions
        return x.permute(0, 2, 1, 3)
    
    def merge_heads(self, x):
        batch_size = x.size(0)
        len_q = x.size(2)
        
        # Reverse the swap operations performed during splitting
        x = x.permute(0, 2, 1, 3).contiguous()
        
        # Merge the heads again along the last dimension
        x = x.view(batch_size, len_q, self.num_heads * self.depth)
        
        return x
        
    def forward(self, query, key, value):
        batch_size = query.size(0)
        len_q = query.size(1)
        
        # Split the input into num_heads pieces and apply self-attention to each piece
        outputs = []
        for l, attn_layer in enumerate(self.attn_layers):
            q = self.split_heads(query[:, :, :, :])
            k = self.split_heads(key[:, :, :, :])
            v = self.split_heads(value[:, :, :, :])

            o = attn_layer(q, k, v)
            
            # Move the attention output back to its original location
            outputs.append(self.merge_heads(o))
            
        # Concatenate the output chunks along the last dimension
        output = torch.cat(outputs, dim=2)
        
        # Apply the final linear transformation to combine the output heads
        output = self.output_proj(output)
        
        return output
```

In this implementation, we define the `__init__` method to specify the input dimensionality `d_model` and the number of heads to use `num_heads`. We check that the specified parameters satisfy the requirement that the dimensionality must be divisible by the number of heads. We then create a list of `num_heads` instances of the `SelfAttention` class, one for each head. 

We also define a helper method `split_heads` that splits the input tensor into `num_heads` equal parts along the last dimension and swaps the dimensions to get the correct order of dimensions. Similarly, we define a `merge_heads` method that reverses the operation performed during splitting. 

During training, we pass the input tensors `query`, `key`, and `value` through the forward method. We first split the input into `num_heads` equal pieces using the `split_heads` method, and then pass each piece through the respective `SelfAttention` layer. We concatenate the outputs along the last dimension using the `merge_heads` method and save them in a list `outputs`. 

Finally, we concatenate the output chunks along the last dimension using `torch.cat` and apply the final linear transformation to map the output to the expected size `d_model`. We return the output tensor as the final output.
