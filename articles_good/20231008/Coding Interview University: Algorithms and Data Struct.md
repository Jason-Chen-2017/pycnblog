# 1.背景介绍


The Coding Interview University is a free online course available on Coursera that offers valuable insights into how to approach computer science interviews. It provides clear explanations of data structures and algorithms with real-world examples for students who are new to this field or have little prior knowledge about it. 

The course starts by explaining the different types of algorithmic questions you may encounter in an interview: sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms. Then, it teaches you various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, hash tables, trees, and graphs, and their properties and uses cases. In addition to these fundamental concepts, the course also covers important topics like time complexity analysis, space complexity analysis, and common coding interview pitfalls.

Overall, the course aims to provide the student with practical skills and a strong foundation in order to crack any tech company's coding challenge.

# 2.核心概念与联系
In this section, we will introduce some key concepts and techniques covered in this course along with their relationships and connections to one another. 

1. Algorithmic Complexity Analysis (ACA)
	- Big O notation - This concept helps us understand the efficiency of an algorithm based on its input size. It is used extensively throughout the course to analyze the performance of our code. 
	- Time complexity analysis
		- Best Case - The best case scenario refers to the most efficient case where all operations in the algorithm take place within the specified time limit. 
		- Worst Case - The worst case scenario represents when the largest element in the dataset takes up more than half of the remaining elements in the array. For example, if we need to find the maximum element in an unsorted integer array, then the worst case would occur when every operation needs to be performed sequentially until the end of the list.  

	- Space complexity analysis
		- Constant space complexity - If the amount of memory needed does not depend on the size of the input, then it is considered constant space complexity. Examples include recursion and in-place sorting.
		- Linear space complexity - If the amount of memory needed increases linearly proportional to the size of the input, then it is considered linear space complexity. Examples include simple dynamic programming problems like Fibonacci sequence generation.
		- Logarithmic space complexity - If the amount of memory needed depends on log(n), i.e., the number of steps required to solve the problem doubles with each increment of n, then it is considered logarithmic space complexity. Examples include binary search algorithms.

		
		
		
2. Recursion
	- Recursive functions are functions that call themselves inside them. They are commonly used to implement complex mathematical equations, solve mazes, perform tree traversal etc. 
	- Base case - A recursive function should have a base case which is the stopping condition for the recursion. Without this, the function would continue infinitely, leading to stack overflow errors.
	- Tree recursion - Tree recursion involves dividing the original problem into subproblems recursively until they become small enough to be solved directly. This can help reduce the time complexity of certain algorithms.

3. Dynamic Programming (DP)
	- DP is a technique used to solve optimization problems that require breaking down a larger problem into smaller subproblems and solving those subproblems only once. 
	- Memoization - DP relies heavily on memoizing intermediate results so that future calculations do not repeat redundant computations. This reduces the overall computational cost. 
	- Top-down vs Bottom-up approaches - Both top-down and bottom-up methods exist for solving DP problems but differ in terms of the order in which solutions are derived. Typically, top-down methods start from the smallest subproblem and work towards the large ones while bottom-up methods derive solutions starting from the largest subproblem and working backwards towards the smallest ones. 
	- Overlapping Subproblems - In many DP problems, the same subproblem appears multiple times over the course of the solution process. To avoid repeating unnecessary computations, DP employs a technique called overlapping subproblems which avoids recomputing the same subproblems multiple times.

4. Greedy Algorithms (GA)
	- GA is an optimization technique that tries to find the locally optimal solution at each step. As opposed to global optimization, local optimization tends to be faster and less computationally intensive than globally optimal solutions. 
	- Approach - Choose a decision that leads to the highest expected gain at each step without considering what happens later in the game. 
	- Pitfalls - While using GA, make sure that your implementation doesn’t get trapped in a local maxima trap and keep exploring alternative moves to reach the global optimum. 

5. Sorting Algorithms
	- There are several popular sorting algorithms that are used to sort collections of items in ascending or descending order based on specific criteria. These include quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, bucket sort etc. 
	- Mergesort has a time complexity of O(nlogn) making it the fastest known sorting algorithm. 
	- Other sorting algorithms like counting sort, radix sort etc. can also be used depending on the requirements of the application. 

6. Search Algorithms
	- Breadth first search (BFS) - Explores the neighbors of a given node first before moving to other nodes in the graph. It typically expands outward from the starting point, hence the name "breadth first".
	- Depth first search (DFS) - Traverses through the graph either depth-first or breadth-first until it finds a target node or reaches a dead end. DFS visits vertices in the order of creation, meaning it explores deeper branches first. It maintains a set of visited vertices to ensure that it doesn't visit the same vertex twice. 

7. Trees and Graphs
	- Tree - A tree consists of nodes connected by edges. Each edge carries a directionality, indicating whether it goes from parent to child or vice versa. The root node of a tree points to the rest of the nodes in the tree, which are called its children.
	- Binary tree - A binary tree is a type of tree structure in which each node has at most two children. Common applications of binary trees include binary search trees, red-black trees, and Huffman codes.
	- Trie - A trie is a kind of search tree that stores a collection of strings. Each string is stored as a sequence of characters. Unlike a regular dictionary that contains words, tries allow partial matches. 
	- Hash table - A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values. It allows for very efficient retrieval of values associated with a particular key. Common implementations include open addressing and separate chaining. 

8. Bit Manipulation
	- Bit manipulation is a technique used to manipulate individual bits or groups of bits within a piece of data. It enables programmers to write programs that run much faster than conventional loops or conditional statements because bitwise operations execute quickly compared to arithmetic or logical operations. 
# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解

We now move on to discuss some core algorithms and data structures that are used in technical interviews:

1. Arrays and Strings
	Arrays and strings are essential data structures that you must know well to pass technical interviews. Here are some important operations on arrays and strings:

	1. Traverse an Array/String
		To traverse an array/string means accessing all its elements one by one. One way to do this is to use a loop. Here are some ways to traverse an array/string:

		```python
		array = [1, 2, 3]
		for item in array:
		    print(item)
		```

		Another method is to access an element using its index:

		```python
		array[0] # returns 1
		```

		Both of these methods will output `1`, `2`, and `3`. You can apply this logic to strings as well. However, there are variations of traversing strings. One common practice is to iterate over each character of a string using a loop:

		```python
		string = 'hello'
		for char in string:
		    print(char)
		```

		This will output `h`, `e`, `l`, `l`, and `o` in order. Another option is to convert a string into a list of characters and then traverse that list:

		```python
		string_list = list('hello')
		for char in string_list:
		    print(char)
		```

	2. Find the length of an Array/String
		Finding the length of an array/string is easy using Python's built-in len() function:

		```python
		array = [1, 2, 3]
		length = len(array) # returns 3
		
		string = 'hello'
		length = len(string) # returns 5
		```

	3. Reverse an Array/String
		Reversing an array or a string can be done easily using slicing syntax. Slicing works by specifying a range of indices within brackets [] separated by a colon (:). When you slice an array or a string, Python creates a new object containing the selected elements:

		```python
		original_array = [1, 2, 3]
		reversed_array = original_array[::-1] # returns [3, 2, 1]
		
		original_string = 'hello'
		reversed_string = original_string[::-1] # returns 'olleh'
		```

	4. Check if a Value Exists in an Array/String
		Checking if a value exists in an array or a string can be done using the in keyword. This checks if the value is present in the array/string:

		```python
		array = [1, 2, 3]
		value = 2
		if value in array:
		    print("Value found!") # prints "Value found!"
		
		string = 'hello'
		value = 'o'
		if value in string:
		    print("Value found!") # prints "Value found!"
		```

	5. Concatenate Two Arrays/Strings
		Concatenating two arrays or two strings together can be done using the + operator. This creates a new object that combines the contents of both arrays/strings:

		```python
		array1 = [1, 2, 3]
		array2 = [4, 5, 6]
		concatenated_array = array1 + array2 # returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
		
		string1 = 'hello'
		string2 ='world'
		concatenated_string = string1 + string2 # returns 'hello world'
		```

	6. Remove Duplicates From an Array/String
		Removing duplicates from an array or a string can be done using sets. Sets automatically remove duplicates, so you don't need to worry about checking for them manually:

		```python
		array = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4]
		unique_array = list(set(array)) # returns [1, 2, 3, 4]
		
		string = 'hello world hello'
		unique_string = ''.join(set(string)) # returns 'helowrd'
		```

	7. Convert a String to an Array of Characters
		Converting a string to an array of characters can be done using the list() function:

		```python
		string = 'hello'
		character_array = list(string) # returns ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
		```

	8. Modify an Element in an Array/String
		Modifying an element in an array or a string can be done using indexing. This assigns a new value to an existing position in the array/string:

		```python
		array = [1, 2, 3]
		index = 1
		new_value = 4
		array[index] = new_value # modifies array to [1, 4, 3]
		
		string = 'hello'
		index = 2
		new_value = 'z'
		string = string[:index] + new_value + string[index+1:] # modifies string to 'helzo'
		```

	9. Swap Two Elements in an Array/String
		Swapping two elements in an array or a string requires four lines of code. First, assign the value of one element to a temporary variable:

		```python
		array = [1, 2, 3]
		i = 0
		j = 1
		temp = array[i]
		```

		Then, overwrite the value of the first element with the value of the second element:

		```python
		array[i] = array[j]
		```

		Finally, overwrite the value of the second element with the temp variable:

		```python
		array[j] = temp
		```

	10. Implement a Stack Using an Array
		Implementing a stack using an array is a simple data structure that supports push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty() operations. Push() adds an element to the top of the stack, pop() removes the element at the top of the stack, peek() shows the element at the top of the stack without removing it, and isEmpty() checks if the stack is empty:

		```python
		class Stack:
		    def __init__(self):
		        self.items = []
		        
		    def push(self, item):
		        self.items.append(item)
		        
		    def pop(self):
		        return self.items.pop()
		    
		    def peek(self):
		        return self.items[-1]
		        
		    def isEmpty(self):
		        return len(self.items) == 0
		
		stack = Stack()
		stack.push(1)
		stack.push(2)
		stack.push(3)
		print(stack.peek()) # prints 3
		print(stack.pop()) # prints 3
		print(stack.isEmpty()) # prints False
		```

	11. Implement a Queue Using an Array
		Implementing a queue using an array is similar to implementing a stack. Instead of pushing elements onto the top of the stack, queues add elements to the back of the queue and remove elements from the front:

		```python
		class Queue:
		    def __init__(self):
		        self.items = []
		        
		    def enqueue(self, item):
		        self.items.insert(0, item)
		        
		    def dequeue(self):
		        return self.items.pop()
		        
		    def isEmpty(self):
		        return len(self.items) == 0
		
		queue = Queue()
		queue.enqueue(1)
		queue.enqueue(2)
		queue.enqueue(3)
		print(queue.dequeue()) # prints 1
		print(queue.dequeue()) # prints 2
		print(queue.isEmpty()) # prints False
		```

	12. Calculate the Sum of All Elements in an Array/String
		Calculating the sum of all elements in an array or a string can be done using a loop:

		```python
		def calculate_sum(arr):
		    total = 0
		    for num in arr:
		        total += num
		    return total
		
		array = [1, 2, 3]
		total = calculate_sum(array) # returns 6
		
		string = 'hello'
		total = calculate_sum([ord(char) for char in string]) # calculates ASCII values of characters and adds them up
		```

	13. Count the Number of Occurrences of a Character in a String
		Counting the number of occurrences of a character in a string can be done using a loop:

		```python
		def count_occurrences(string, char):
		    count = 0
		    for c in string:
		        if c == char:
		            count += 1
		    return count
		
		string = 'hello'
		count = count_occurrences(string, 'l') # returns 3
		```

	14. Reverse Words in a Sentence
		Reverse words in a sentence can be done using split(), join(), and reversed() functions:

		```python
		sentence = 'the cat in the hat'
		words = sentence.split()
		reversed_words = reversed(words)
		reversed_sentence =''.join(reversed_words)
		```

	15. Determine the Maximum Element in an Array/String
		Determining the maximum element in an array or a string can be done using the max() function:

		```python
		max_element = max(array)
		```

	16. Generate Random Numbers Between a Range
		Generating random numbers between a range can be done using the random module:

		```python
		import random
		
		random_number = random.randint(0, 100)
		```

	17. Shuffle an Array/String
		Shuffling an array or a string can be done using the shuffle() function from the random module:

		```python
		import random
		
		array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
		random.shuffle(array) # shuffles the array randomly
		
		string = 'hello'
		random_chars = random.sample(string, len(string)) # generates a list of unique random characters from the string
		shuffled_string = ''.join(random_chars) # converts the list back to a string
		```

	18. Perform Binary Search on an Array/String
		Performing binary search on an array or a string is useful for finding an element efficiently in a sorted collection. The binary search algorithm compares the middle element of the collection with the target element, discards the half of the collection that cannot contain the target, and repeats the comparison until the target is found or the entire collection has been searched:

		```python
		def binary_search(arr, x):
		    low = 0
		    high = len(arr) - 1
		    
		    while low <= high:
		        mid = (low + high) // 2
		        if arr[mid] < x:
		            low = mid + 1
		        elif arr[mid] > x:
		            high = mid - 1
		        else:
		            return True
		    return False
		
		array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
		x = 3
		result = binary_search(array, x) # returns True
		
		string = 'hello'
		x = 'l'
		result = ord(x) in [ord(c) for c in string] # compares ASCII values instead of characters
		```

	19. Print All Permutations of a String
		Printing all permutations of a string can be done using itertools.permutations():

		```python
		from itertools import permutations
		
		string = 'abc'
		perms = [''.join(p) for p in permutations(string)]
		```

	20. Determine Whether a String Is Palindrome or Not
		Determine whether a string is palindrome or not can be done using slicing and comparing characters from opposite ends of the string:

		```python
		def is_palindrome(string):
		    rev_str = string[::-1]
		    return str == rev_str
		
		string = 'racecar'
		is_pal = is_palindrome(string) # returns True
		
		string = 'hello'
		is_pal = is_palindrome(string) # returns False
		```

	21. Implement a Max Heap Using an Array
		An array can be used to implement a max heap in Python. Simply create a class MaxHeap that holds the heap as an attribute. Define the following methods to manipulate the heap:

		- insert(val) - Adds a new value to the heap
		- deleteMax() - Removes and returns the maximum value in the heap
		- buildHeap(lst) - Builds a heap from a list of values

		Here is an implementation of a max heap using an array:

		```python
		class MaxHeap:
		    def __init__(self):
		        self.heap = [None]
		        
		    def getParentIndex(self, idx):
		        return (idx - 1) // 2
		        
		    def getLeftChildIndex(self, idx):
		        return 2 * idx + 1
		        
		    def getRightChildIndex(self, idx):
		        return 2 * idx + 2
		        
		    def swap(self, i, j):
		        self.heap[i], self.heap[j] = self.heap[j], self.heap[i]
		        
		    def insert(self, val):
		        self.heap.append(val)
		        idx = len(self.heap) - 1
		        while idx!= 0:
		            parentIdx = self.getParentIndex(idx)
		            if self.heap[parentIdx] < val:
		                break
		            self.swap(parentIdx, idx)
		            idx = parentIdx
		        
		    def deleteMax(self):
		        if len(self.heap) <= 1:
		            raise ValueError("Heap underflow")
		        rootVal = self.heap[0]
		        lastVal = self.heap.pop()
		        if len(self.heap) > 1:
		            self.heap[0] = lastVal
		            idx = 0
		            while idx < len(self.heap) // 2:
		                leftChildIdx = self.getLeftChildIndex(idx)
		                rightChildIdx = self.getRightChildIndex(idx)
		                
		                if rightChildIdx >= len(self.heap) or self.heap[leftChildIdx] >= self.heap[rightChildIdx]:
		                    if self.heap[leftChildIdx] > self.heap[idx]:
		                        self.swap(leftChildIdx, idx)
		                    break
		                
		                if self.heap[rightChildIdx] > self.heap[idx]:
		                    self.swap(rightChildIdx, idx)
		                    
		                idx = rightChildIdx
		            
		        return rootVal
		        
		    def buildHeap(self, lst):
		        for val in lst:
		            self.insert(val)
				
		heap = MaxHeap()
		heap.buildHeap([5, 3, 8, 2, 10])
		print(heap.deleteMax()) # prints 10
		print(heap.deleteMax()) # prints 8
		```

	22. Build a HashMap from Two Lists
		You can build a hash map from two lists using zip(). The resulting iterator produces tuples of corresponding elements from the two lists:

		```python
		keys = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
		values = [1, 2, 3]
		
		myMap = dict(zip(keys, values))
		print(myMap['orange']) # prints 3
		```

	23. Compare Two Dictionaries
		Comparing two dictionaries can be done using the cmp() function:

		```python
		d1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
		d2 = {'b': 2, 'a': 1}
		
		if d1 == d2:
		    print("Dictionaries are equal.")
		elif cmp(d1, d2) == 0:
		    print("Dictionaries are identical.")
		else:
		    print("Dictionaries are not equal.")
		```

	24. Encode a URL
		Encoding a URL is a common task in web development. You can use urllib.parse.quote() to encode URLs:

		```python
		import urllib.parse
		
		url = '/search?q=coding%20interview&cat=engineering'
		encoded_url = urllib.parse.quote(url)
		print(encoded_url) # prints %2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dcoding%2520interview%26cat%3Dengineering
		```

	25. Decode a URL
		Decoding a URL is just as important as encoding it. You can use urllib.parse.unquote() to decode encoded URLs:

		```python
		import urllib.parse
		
		encoded_url = '%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dcoding%2520interview%26cat%3Dengineering'
		decoded_url = urllib.parse.unquote(encoded_url)
		print(decoded_url) # prints /search?q=coding%20interview&cat=engineering
		```

	26. Validate an Email Address
		Validating an email address can involve quite a few steps. However, one possible approach is to use a regular expression:

		```python
		import re
		
		email = 'johndoe@example.com'
		pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
		match = re.match(pattern, email)
		if match:
		    print("Email is valid.")
		else:
		    print("Email is invalid.")
		```

	27. Parse a Query String
		Parsing a query string can be done using the urlparse module:

		```python
		from urllib.parse import urlparse, parse_qs
		
		query_string = 'q=coding+interview&cat=engineering'
		parsed_url = urlparse('http://example.com/?' + query_string)
		params = parse_qs(parsed_url.query)
		```
