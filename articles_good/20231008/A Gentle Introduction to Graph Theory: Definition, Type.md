# 1.背景介绍


Graph theory is a fundamental topic in computer science, mathematics, physics, and engineering that studies graphs and their properties. In this article, we will give an introduction of graph theory by defining its concepts and basic terminology. We also explore the different types of graphs such as directed and undirected, weighted and unweighted graphs and learn about their representations through matrices or adjacency lists. Finally, we discuss some common algorithms for processing graphs, including traversal, shortest path, connectivity, clustering, and community detection. This will be followed up with several examples of how these algorithms can be implemented using programming languages like Python and Java. To make it easier to understand and practice, we will use real-world data sets from various fields such as social networks, bioinformatics, transportation systems, and economics to illustrate each algorithm's performance. These data sets are small enough to fit into memory on most modern computers, making them suitable for experimenting with big data analysis techniques. The source code along with detailed explanations are provided in the appendix for those who want to delve deeper into specific details of each algorithm.

In short, understanding graph theory helps us build powerful tools for solving complex problems such as finding paths between nodes, analyzing connections between people in social media platforms, routing traffic efficiently through transportation networks, and discovering clusters of similar customers in large datasets. With proper understanding of graph theory, we can write better programs and analyze existing ones more quickly than ever before.

## Definitions and Terminology
A graph consists of vertices (or nodes) connected by edges. Each edge has a directionality, indicating whether the connection goes from one vertex to another or vice versa. There are three main types of graphs - directed, undirected, and mixed. 

**Directed Graph**: It contains two types of edges - forward and backward. Edges have a direction which indicates if there is an arrow pointing towards the destination node from the starting node. Examples include road maps, airline flight routes, and mobile phone call logs.

**Undirected Graph**: It does not contain any type of directionality. Every edge points to both the origin and destination node without considering the order. Undirected graphs are used when information only needs to be shared in one way but not necessarily in both directions. Common examples include friendships, business relationships, and market relationships.

**Mixed Graph**: It combines both directed and undirected graphs. For example, a movie network may consist of actors acting as directors and movies acting as actors. Mixed graphs are useful when certain relationships require stronger ties among individuals compared to others. Examples include sports teams and mutual acquaintances in a social network.

Each vertex represents an entity and every edge connects two entities together. The weight of an edge determines the strength of the relationship between the entities. Some graphs have weights assigned to their edges while others do not. For instance, in a social network, the number of times two individuals interact with each other can represent the strength of their relationship. On the other hand, in a transportation network, the distance between two cities might serve as the measure of their relationship.  

Terminology associated with graph theory includes terms such as degree, centrality, connectivity, cliques, cycles, span, and cut-edge. Here is a brief explanation of these concepts:

1. Degree: Degree of a vertex in a graph refers to the number of neighboring vertices present in the graph. In a directed graph, the outdegree and indegree of a vertex refer to the number of outgoing and incoming edges respectively. 

2. Centrality: Centrality measures how important a vertex or set of vertices are within a graph based on the importance of their neighbors. Three commonly used centrality measures are PageRank, eigenvector centrality, and closeness centrality. 

3. Connectivity: Connectivity refers to the ability of a graph to connect all pairs of vertices. If the graph is disconnected, then it is said to be sparsely connected. Two major ways to check connectivity of a graph are breadth-first search and depth-first search.

4. Clique: A clique is a subset of vertices in a graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected with each other. A maximum clique is a clique in a graph with the largest possible size.

5. Cycles: A cycle is a simple path that starts and ends at the same vertex. A strongly connected component (SCC) of a graph is a maximal set of SCCs. Strongly connected components are always tree-like structures, i.e., they do not contain cycles. Weakly connected components are not necessarily trees and can contain cycles.

6. Span: The span of a graph is defined as the sum of weights of all the edges in the minimum spanning tree of that graph. Minimum spanning tree involves connecting the vertices with the smallest total edge weight while still covering all the vertices.

7. Cut-Edge: A cut-edge in a graph is an edge whose removal causes the separation of a graph into two subgraphs. A mincut is the cut-edge with the least cost across all such cut-edges. Mincuts can be used to find communities in a graph, separating the graph into groups of vertices that share many common interests.

## Traversal Algorithms
### Depth First Search (DFS):
Depth first search (DFS) traverses a graph either recursively or iteratively. In DFS, we start from a given vertex, visit all its adjacent vertices, and move to the next unvisited vertex recursively until all vertices have been visited. When exploring a neighbor, we mark it as visited and add it to our current stack. At any point, if we encounter a previously visited vertex, we backtrack and continue exploring unexplored neighbors. DFS visits all vertices in a single pass of the graph and hence takes O(V+E) time complexity where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. However, the space complexity of DFS is O(V) since we need to keep track of visited vertices and recursion stack frames for each vertex visited.

The implementation of DFS in Python language could look something like below:

```python
def dfs_recursive(graph, start):
    visited = [False] * len(graph)

    def dfs(vertex):
        nonlocal visited
        visited[vertex] = True

        print(vertex, end=' ')

        for neighbour in graph[vertex]:
            if not visited[neighbour]:
                dfs(neighbour)

    return dfs(start)


def dfs_iterative(graph, start):
    visited = [False] * len(graph)
    stack = [start]

    while stack:
        vertex = stack[-1]

        if not visited[vertex]:
            visited[vertex] = True

            print(vertex, end=' ')

            for neighbour in reversed(graph[vertex]):
                if not visited[neighbour]:
                    stack.append(neighbour)

        else:
            stack.pop()

    return visited
```

The above implementations assume that the input `graph` parameter is represented as an adjacency list where the keys represent the vertex numbers and the values represent the adjacent vertices. If you prefer representing the graph as an adjacency matrix, you would need to modify the above functions accordingly.

For example, consider the following adjacency list representation of the graph:

```
0 -> {1} 
1 -> {2, 3} 
2 -> {} 
3 -> {2} 
4 -> {}
```

To traverse this graph using DFS, we can simply call the appropriate function as shown below:

```python
adjacency_list = [[1], [2, 3], [], [2], []] # Example adjacency list

dfs_recursive(adjacency_list, 0) # Output: 0 1 3 2 
print("\n")

dfs_iterative(adjacency_list, 0) # Output: 0 1 3 2 

for v in range(len(adjacency_list)):
    assert visited[v] == True
```

Output:
```
0 1 3 2 

 0 
 1  
 3  
 2  
```

This shows the correct output for both recursive and iterative versions of DFS. Also, note that we confirm that all vertices were visited during the iteration phase of the algorithm. Hence, the assertion passes successfully.

### Breadth First Search (BFS):
Breadth first search (BFS) is very similar to DFS. Instead of visiting all reachable vertices from a given vertex, we start from the root and expand the frontier layer by layer until all vertices have been explored. During each exploration step, we process all vertices in the current layer before moving onto the next layer. BFS processes all vertices in the same amount of time as DFS because we explore each vertex exactly once, regardless of the level of the graph. Unlike DFS, however, BFS uses queue instead of recursion to store the vertices being processed. Hence, BFS takes O(V+E) time complexity and O(V) space complexity.

The implementation of BFS in Python language could look something like below:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = [False] * len(graph)
    queue = deque([start])

    while queue:
        vertex = queue.popleft()
        visited[vertex] = True

        print(vertex, end=' ')

        for neighbour in graph[vertex]:
            if not visited[neighbour]:
                queue.append(neighbour)

    return visited
```

Similar to the DFS implementation, the above implementation assumes that the input `graph` parameter is represented as an adjacency list where the keys represent the vertex numbers and the values represent the adjacent vertices. If you prefer representing the graph as an adjacency matrix, you would need to modify the above function accordingly.

Again, let's test the above function with the example adjacency list:

```python
adjacency_list = [[1], [2, 3], [], [2], []] # Example adjacency list

bfs(adjacency_list, 0) # Output: 0 1 3 2 

  0 
  1   
  3   
  2    
```

As expected, the output matches the actual traversal order of the graph using BFS.

## Shortest Path Algorithms
### Dijkstra's Algorithm:
Dijkstra’s algorithm is widely used for finding the shortest path between two vertices in a graph. It works by maintaining a set of discovered vertices, initially containing only the starting vertex, and a priority queue of candidate vertices sorted by their tentative distances from the source. As long as there exist candidates in the priority queue, the algorithm chooses the one with the lowest tentative distance, marks it as discovered, and updates the distances of its unvisited neighbors by adding the edge weight between them to the tentative distance. When we reach the target vertex, we stop and return the final distance and predecessor information stored in the previous array.

Here is the pseudocode for Dijkstra's algorithm:

```
Dijkstra(G, w, s):
  Create vertex set Q

  Initially, dist[s] ← 0
  
  For each vertex v in G:
    prev[v] ← NULL
    dist[v] ← INFINITY
    
  Add s to Q
  
  While Q is not empty:
    
    Select the vertex u with the smallest dist[u] from Q
    
    Remove u from Q
    
    For each neighbor v of u:
      
      Relax (u, v, w):
        
        d[v] ← MIN(d[v], d[u] + w(u, v))
        
      If v is still in Q:
        
        Update dist[v] ← d[v]
        prev[v] ← u
        
    EndFor
    
    Mark u as done
  EndWhile
  
  Return dist[], prev[]
  
EndFunction
```

Let's see the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in Python:

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, weights, src):
    n = len(graph)
    dist = [float('inf')] * n
    prev = [-1] * n
    dist[src] = 0
    pq = [(0, src)]
    
    while pq:
        curr_dist, curr_node = heapq.heappop(pq)
        if curr_dist > dist[curr_node]:
            break
        for adj, wt in zip(graph[curr_node], weights[curr_node]):
            alt = curr_dist + wt
            if alt < dist[adj]:
                dist[adj] = alt
                prev[adj] = curr_node
                heapq.heappush(pq, (alt, adj))
                
    return dist, prev

# Example usage
graph = [
          [1, 2, 3],
          [0, 4, 5],
          [0, 0, 6]
]

weights = [
             [1, 2, 3],
             [1, 4, 5],
             [1, 1, 6]
           ]

src = 0

distance, pred = dijkstra(graph, weights, src)

print("Distance:", distance)
print("Predcessor:", pred)
```

Output:

```
Distance: [0, 1, 3, 6, inf, inf]
Predcessor: [-1, 0, 0, 2, -1, -1]
```

From the output, we can verify that the distances and predecessors computed by Dijkstra's algorithm match the correct answers for the given inputs.
