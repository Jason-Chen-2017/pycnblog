**Example Problem:**
Design a chatbot interface that uses AR to provide interactive product information to users in a shopping mall.

**Solution:**
To implement this, you would need to integrate a chatbot framework with an AR platform like ARKit for iOS or ARCore for Android. The chatbot would be designed to recognize the user's location and the products they are interested in, then display relevant product information in AR.

```python
# Pseudo-code for AR chatbot interface
def display_product_info(product_id, location):
    # Use AR platform APIs to display product information
    ar_display.virtual_object(product_id, location)
    # Chatbot sends a confirmation message
    chatbot.sendMessage("Here's the product information you requested.")
```

**Question 2: Describe the role of computer vision in AR chatbots.**

**Answer:**
Computer vision plays a crucial role in AR chatbots by enabling the recognition of images, objects, and scenes. In the context of AR chatbots, computer vision is used for:

* **Object Detection:** Identifying and locating objects within the user's view.
* **Image Recognition:** Matching captured images with a database of known objects or products.
* **Scene Understanding:** Analyzing the environment to provide context-specific information.

**Example Problem:**
Implement an object detection system using a deep learning model to identify and classify objects in the user's view.

**Solution:**
You can use TensorFlow and Keras to train a deep learning model for object detection. Here's an example using a pre-trained model:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Load a pre-trained object detection model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('path/to/object_detection_model')

# Capture an image using the camera
input_image = capture_image()

# Preprocess the image
input_image = preprocess_image(input_image)

# Run object detection on the image
predictions = model.predict(np.expand_dims(input_image, axis=0))

# Extract object labels and scores
boxes = predictions['detection_boxes']
labels = predictions['detection_classes']
scores = predictions['detection_scores']

# Display detected objects
for box, label, score in zip(boxes.flatten(), labels.flatten(), scores.flatten()):
    if score > 0.5:
        display_object_label(label, box)
```

### 2. AR Chatbot: Natural Language Processing

* **Dialogue Management:** Managing the conversation flow and providing appropriate responses.

**Example Problem:**
Implement an NLP system to recognize user intents and extract entities from a given sentence.

**Solution:**
You can use a pre-trained NLP model like BERT or GPT-3 for intent recognition and entity extraction. Here's an example using the `transformers` library:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load an NLP model
nlp = pipeline("text-classification", model="bert-base-uncased")

# Input sentence
sentence = "I want to buy a red shirt."

# Recognize user intent
intent = nlp(sentence)[0]['label']

# Extract entities
entities = extract_entities(sentence)

# Output results
print("Intent:", intent)
print("Entities:", entities)
```
