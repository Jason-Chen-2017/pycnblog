         Before discussing the core components of deep learning models for computer vision, let's first define some related terms and concepts. Here are brief descriptions and explanations of these terminologies: 
         - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): This is a type of deep learning model developed using the convolution operation. It uses filters or kernel matrices to extract relevant patterns from input images. The layers in CNNs typically consist of several feature maps generated through different filters, which can be combined together at different levels to produce more comprehensive representations of the input image. The convolution operation enables the network to learn spatial relationships between adjacent pixels and help identify features such as edges, corners, and textures. 
         - Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): RNNs are used in many natural language processing tasks where sequences of inputs need to be processed sequentially. An RNN consists of multiple hidden units that process one element at a time. At each step, the output of the previous state and input vector is fed into the next hidden unit along with additional information provided by feedback connections. 
         - Transformer: Transformers are another type of deep learning model that was introduced in 2017. They have achieved state-of-the-art performance on text translation tasks and other NLP tasks. Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in text and generate accurate representations of words without explicitly modeling their orderings.

         ## 3.1 模型结构
         
         ### 3.1.1 LeNet-5
         
         The original LeNet-5 [1] model was designed to recognize handwritten digits, but it had relatively few hidden layers and thus required large amounts of training data before achieving good accuracy. Today, LeNet-5 has been replaced by modern architectures such as AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet, all of which have better performance and faster convergence than LeNet-5. Nevertheless, even the best modern CNN models still struggle to achieve top-notch performance on small datasets like MNIST. To improve performance on smaller datasets, researchers explored techniques such as weight initialization, dropout regularization, and batch normalization. These techniques improved the accuracy of many models while reducing overfitting and improving the speed and stability of training.
         

         

         ### 3.1.2 AlexNet
         
         AlexNet [2] is one of the earliest CNN models designed specifically for ImageNet classification task. It included two convolutional layers followed by three fully connected layers. Its architecture diagram shows how it operates:



         The main advantage of AlexNet compared to earlier models was its use of a smaller input size (AlexNet used a 227 × 227 pixel input instead of traditional 28 × 28). Also, the addition of local response normalization helped prevent vanishing gradients problem.

         Another important improvement in AlexNet was the introduction of the dropout technique, which reduced overfitting and made the model less susceptible to memorizing specific examples. Batch Normalization [3] was also introduced to accelerate convergence and make the model more stable during training. 

         Despite these improvements, AlexNet did not reach near state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet dataset until its successor AlexNet V2. 


         ### 3.1.3 VGG
         
         VGG [4] stands for Visual Geometry Group. It is a famous model created by Oxford University in 2014. One advantage of VGG models is that they only contain three convolutional layers followed by max pooling layers rather than five or seven layers, making them easier to train and less computationally expensive than larger models. 

         There are several versions of VGG, each optimized for a particular application. VGG16 is commonly used for color images and VGG19 is often used for grayscale images. Here is an example of VGG16:


         As you can see, VGG16 contains eight convolutional layers with alternating strides of 2, corresponding to a total of 16 filters per layer. Each convolutional layer includes bias term to avoid collapsing to zero, and there are no activation functions or pooling operations beyond the last max pooling layer.


         ### 3.1.4 GoogLeNet
         
         GoogleNet [5], also known as Inception v1, has shown promise in image classification tasks. It combines several innovative ideas together, such as parallel paths within the same network, depthwise separable convolutions, and auxiliary classifiers. The key idea behind Inception module is that it splits the input image into different subregions and applies separate convolutional filters on each region, then concatenates the outputs of those regions together. By stacking several modules, GoogLeNet surpasses the performance of prior art on ILSVRC challenge dataset. 

         Here is the architecture of GoogLeNet:



         GoogLeNet uses four types of modules: standard convolution block, Inception Module, reduction module, and global average pool. The standard convolution block consists of a series of convolutional layers with same number of filters and strides, and a non-linearity function such as relu. The Inception Module involves splitting the input into several subregions and applying separately trained convolutional filters on each subregion. Then, the concatenation of the outputs provides input to the subsequent layers. The reduction module reduces the dimensionality of the network by halving the number of filters and height and width dimensions. Global Average Pooling layer pools the output of the entire network across the spatial dimensions to produce a fixed length representation regardless of input size.


         ### 3.1.5 ResNet
         
         ResNet [6] is arguably the most influential CNN architecture for image classification. Residual blocks were proposed to address the vanishing gradient problem in traditional CNNs. Instead of learning from scratch, ResNet learns only the residual mapping of the input signal, which is added to the output of the previous layer to form the new output. This helps reduce the complexity of the model and prevents the network from becoming too deep. With careful design of the skip connection structure, ResNet could potentially match or outperform deeper networks with similar accuracy. 

         Here is the basic architecture of ResNet:


         As you can see, ResNet consists of multiple stacked residual blocks with the shortcut connection bridging the identity mappings. The convolutional layers in ResNet follow the same configuration as conventional CNNs, consisting of several convolutional layers with same number of filters, strides, and padding. The final output is obtained by adding the input signal and the transformed output of the final convolutional layer. The activation function after each convolutional layer is usually a rectified linear unit (relu) except for the last layer which produces the output probabilities.

         
         ## 3.2 数据预处理

         Data augmentation is a critical component of building effective deep learning models for computer vision tasks. Various data preprocessing techniques such as rotation, scaling, flipping, cropping, and contrast adjustment are widely used to enrich the dataset with diverse variations. The goal of data augmentation is to increase the diversity of samples in the dataset, leading to better generalization performance when the model is trained on limited amount of labeled data. Data augmentation techniques can include randomly shifting, rotating, flipping, zooming, shearing, and adjusting brightness and contrast of images.

         For instance, in the case of a binary classification task, we might randomly apply transformations to half of the positive samples and keep the rest unchanged. On the other hand, if we have multi-class classification task with ten classes, we might apply random transformations to any sample belonging to any class. Similarly, when working with bounding box prediction problems, we might randomly perturb the existing bounding boxes to generate new ones.

         Common practices of data augmentation include using predefined transformation parameters for each iteration, using horizontal flip as well as vertical flip, and randomly selecting different combinations of transforms to enhance the diversity of the dataset. 

         Additionally, certain data augmentation techniques can also result in slightly modified label annotations. For example, in face detection tasks, we may add a small random shift to both the x and y coordinates of each bounding box representing a face annotation, which would lead to slight changes in the position of the actual face. Therefore, it is essential to carefully evaluate the effectiveness of data augmentation techniques against their impact on downstream tasks, especially when dealing with highly imbalanced datasets or strong inter-annotator agreements.

         In this section, we will go through details about how to approach each common computer vision task and what kind of deep learning models are suitable for solving them. Specifically, we will cover following topics:
         
         - Object Detection and Classification
           - RCNN, SSD, YOLO
           - Faster RCNN, Mask RCNN

         ## 4.1 对象检测与分类
          
         ### 4.1.1 RCNN, SSD, YOLO
         
         Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision that aims to locate and classify objects in an image. Traditional methods involve searching for target objects in large scale databases or manually defining anchor points around them, which is labor-intensive and leads to low recall rates. To address this issue, many researchers proposed object detectors based on deep learning frameworks. There are several variants of object detectors based on deep learning approaches, including Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN), Single Shot Detectors (SSD), You Only Look Once (YOLO) [7]. Here we'll introduce two of them.


         #### R-CNN
         
         R-CNN [8] represents the beginning stage of the object detector revolution. It is a two-stage approach involving selective search algorithm for region proposals, followed by a feedforward neural network for classification. The main contribution of R-CNN lies in proposing a systematic way for generating region proposals that improves the precision and recall rates simultaneously. However, R-CNN still suffers from its slow running speed because of its iterative procedure.

         Here is the overall architecture of R-CNN:
         
         
         

         #### SSD
         
         SSD [9] improves upon the drawbacks of R-CNN by introducing a single convolutional neural network (convnet) that generates predictions for multiple scales. Instead of detecting objects individually, SSD focuses on detecting objects at multiple sizes, which makes it more efficient and scalable. Unlike previous methods, SSD directly predicts bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores for every detected object, hence eliminating the need for post-processing steps such as non-maximum suppression. 

         Here is the overall architecture of SSD:




         #### YOLO
         
         YOLO [10] is a fast and powerful object detector that can run real-time on CPU. It employs a single neural network that processes the whole image to predict class probabilities and bounding boxes. Different from traditional detectors, YOLO does not require pre-defined anchor points and grid cells. The key insight behind YOLO is to use a regression loss function that encourages the network to predict offsets relative to anchors rather than absolute values. By doing so, YOLO is able to predict highly precise and accurate bounding boxes.

         Here is the overall architecture of YOLO:


         

         ### 4.1.2 Faster RCNN, Mask RCNN
         
         Both Faster RCNN [11] and Mask RCNN [12] are two recent advancements in object detection. Faster RCNN replaces the selective search method of R-CNN with a more lightweight and efficient RoI Align algorithm. Moreover, Faster RCNN eliminates redundant computations in R-CNN by sharing feature maps computed by the backbone network, leading to significant speedup. To handle the occlusion caused by human bodies, Faster RCNN introduces a novel branch called mask head that estimates object segmentation masks.

         Here is the overall architecture of Faster RCNN:


         While the above architecture shows the Faster RCNN detector with shared feature maps, here is the equivalent architecture of Mask RCNN:


         The difference between the two architectures lies in the presence of a third branch called mask head for estimating segmentation masks. The mask head takes the output of the shared feature map and produces predicted foreground probability maps for each proposal and the background probability map for the full image. During inference, the masks are refined using pixel-wise cross entropy loss between the predicted probability maps and ground truth segmentation masks.


         ## 4.2 动作识别
         
         ### 4.2.1 LSTM, GRU, ConvLSTM
         
         Action recognition is a challenging task in computer vision that aims to identify and track actions being performed by humans in videos. Many researchers attempted to develop a variety of models to solve this problem. Some of the prominent approaches include Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [13], Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) [14], and Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) [15]. Here we'll discuss briefly about these approaches.


         #### LSTM
         
         LSTM [13] is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that captures temporal dependency among sequential elements. It consists of memory cells that store information and a gate mechanism that controls the flow of information through time. LSTMs can capture long-term dependencies and are capable of handling variable-length input sequences. Here is the overall architecture of an LSTM cell:


         

         #### GRU
         
         GRU [14] is an extension of LSTM that offers comparable or higher accuracy than LSTMs under the same level of computational resources. GRUs replace the sigmoid gates and update equations in LSTM with tanh and ReLU activations, respectively. Similarly, they eliminate the need for keeping track of long-term memory states and only retain short-term memory states, leading to simpler implementation and faster convergence.

         Here is the overall architecture of a GRU cell:




         #### ConvLSTM
         
         ConvLSTM [15] builds upon the idea of LSTM by incorporating convolutional layers into the model. The idea is to convert each frame of video into a set of spatio-temporal feature vectors, which are fed into the LSTM cell. The ConvLSTM module effectively extends the functionality of the standard LSTM module by allowing it to process video frames efficiently.

         Here is the overall architecture of a ConvLSTM cell:




       

         ### 4.2.2 TSN, Temporal Segment Network
         
         Time Series Analysis (TSA) refers to the study of temporal patterns in data. TSA plays a crucial role in many areas of science and technology, including biology, finance, healthcare, and medicine. In action recognition, recognizing actions that occur in the context of continuous motion sequences is a typical scenario. To capture this pattern, Temporal Segment Networks (TSNs) [16] are introduced.

         TSN models aim to learn discriminative features from multiple segments of an input sequence to obtain robust temporal embeddings. Each segment is represented by a compact sequence of learned features, which represent the underlying pattern of motion. The features are then aggregated into a video-level embedding vector by taking the mean value of all segments' features.

         Here is the overall architecture of TSN:


         In summary, TSN models combine multiple segments of video data to capture discriminative features for motion recognition tasks.

         ### 4.2.3 I3D, Inflated 3D ConvNet
         
         Action recognition in videos relies heavily on spatial and temporal features. It becomes even more difficult in the case of complex motion scenes containing multiple moving objects. To overcome this limitation, Intermediate Video (I3D) [17] was proposed.

         I3D models propose to exploit spatiotemporal contexts of a video clip by decomposing it into several independent frames. It leverages i3d convnets that encode each frame into a set of spatiotemporal features that capture both appearance and motion cues. The resulting features are then aggregated into a video-level embedding vector using a combination of averaging and max-pooling operators.

         Here is the overall architecture of I3D:


         Just like TSN, I3D models capture both spatial and temporal cues for action recognition. But unlike TSN, I3D models operate on multiple frames extracted from the input clip rather than just one segment.

   
         ## 4.3 场景理解
         
         ### 4.3.1 Graph Convolutional Net, Wavelet Neural Net, U-Net
         
         Scenes understanding is the process of extracting meaningful and informative visual features from a given input image. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) [18] and wavelet neural nets (WNNs) [19] are two promising approaches to address the task of semantic segmentation in RGB images. U-Net [20] is another variant of GCN that provides competitive accuracy with fewer parameters.
         
         #### Graph Convolutional Net
         
         Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) [18] exploit graph structures formed by pixels to compute feature descriptors that capture rich geometric information of an image. The concept of GCN stems from the observation that nodes in a graph represent visual entities such as pixels, and edges represent the relations between them. GCNs learn weights that represent the importance of each edge or node based on their proximity in the graph, enabling them to capture contextual and structural relationships between pixels.
         
         Here is the overall architecture of a simple GCN:


         The GCN model computes a weighted sum of neighboring pixel features to generate a descriptor for each pixel. The aggregation of neighbor features is defined via a dot product operator and differs depending on whether it belongs to the spatial domain or the spectral domain. In the spatial domain, each pixel has a neighborhood of k nearest neighbors; in the spectral domain, each pixel has a corresponding set of k eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.

         
         #### Wavelet Neural Net
         
         WNNs [19] are extensions of traditional GCNs that use wavelets to represent image patches. Wavelets provide a hierarchical decomposition of the image, enabling them to capture both low-frequency and high-frequency content of the image. The wavelet coefficients are then processed by a shallow neural network, which forms the basis for capturing the semantics of an image.

         Here is the overall architecture of a simple WNN:


         


         #### U-Net
         
         U-Net [20] is another variant of GCN that uses a contracting path and expanding path to upsample and downsample the image resolution, respectively. The central encoder and decoder units employ 3x3 convolutions and skip connections, respectively. U-Net allows for easy localization and segmentation of objects in images.

         Here is the overall architecture of a simple U-Net:
