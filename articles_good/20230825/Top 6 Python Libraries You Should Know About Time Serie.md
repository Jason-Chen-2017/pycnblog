# 1.简介
  

Time series forecasting is the process of predicting future values based on past observations. The goal of time series forecasting is to create a model that can accurately predict future outcomes without relying too heavily on any individual piece of data or parameter. In this article we will be discussing about different libraries available in Python for time series forecasting and implementing them with simple examples. We will also cover key concepts used by these libraries such as seasonality, trends and stationarity along with their significance in modeling time-series data. We will discuss some common challenges faced during implementation like missing values, categorical variables, variable scaling, and selection of appropriate algorithms for your use case.

In this article I have selected top six python libraries for time series forecasting: Statsmodels, Prophet, ARIMA, scikit-learn, Neural Networks and Pytorch. Each library has its own set of advantages and disadvantages and may not be suitable for all use cases. However, it is important to understand the fundamental principles behind each technique and choose an appropriate one according to the complexity of the problem at hand. So let’s get started! 

# 2.Background Introduction
Time series forecasting is widely used in various industries for making decision-making more accurate and efficient. It helps organizations in planning and managing resources, monitoring and controlling processes, and improving operational efficiency. Some of the areas where time series forecasting is useful are stock market analysis, sales and demand prediction, energy consumption forecasting, weather forecasting, demand forecasting for production, and many others. Here are some benefits of using time series forecasting:

1. Accurate Predictions: Time series forecasting provides predictions with high accuracy because it takes into account patterns and relationships between multiple variables over time. This makes it possible to make precise decisions with confidence. 

2. Forecasts with Insights: Time series forecasting allows you to explore patterns and identify hidden trends within complex data sets. By analyzing historical data and identifying the underlying factors, forecasters can gain valuable insights into the future. 

3. Planning Improvements: With time series forecasting, you can anticipate changes in trends and behavior over time and plan ahead accordingly. This can lead to significant savings in costs and revenue. 

4. Improved Quality Control: Time series forecasting enables businesses to detect unusual events before they become problematic. This reduces risk and improves quality control procedures. 

5. Safety Management: Time series forecasting can help manage risks throughout supply chains and improve safety by anticipating potential threats and preemptively addressing them. 

# 3.Basic Concepts/Terminology
Before diving into technical details of each library, here are some basic terms and concepts that are commonly used while working with time series data. These terms and concepts include but are not limited to Seasonality, Trends, Stationarity, Autocorrelation Function (ACF), Partial Autocorrelation Function(PACF), Moving Average, Rolling Mean, Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES), Holt Winter’s Method, Box-Cox Transformation, Rolling Statistics, STL Decomposition, VARMAX Model, AR Models, MA models, AIC, BIC. Let's look at how these terms fit together when dealing with time series forecasting.

## Seasonality
Seasonality refers to periodic patterns that repeat itself every year, month, week etc. For example, daily seasonality occurs when the same day of the week repeats itself every year. Seasonality plays an important role in time series forecasting. It means that if there is any pattern that repeats itself periodically then it becomes easier to capture the periodicity through this factor and hence improve our forecasting performance. Commonly, seasonality can arise due to natural causes like calendar fluctuations, temperature variations and global climate change. Therefore, it is essential to take care of seasonality when doing time series forecasting to avoid underestimating or overestimating the effect of seasonal variation on the time series.

The following are methods for capturing seasonality in time series:

1. Fourier Transform: Fourier transform is a method for decomposing a signal into frequencies. Seasonal components in time series are usually well represented as sinusoids or cosines of varying frequency. We can extract the seasonal component from the original signal by applying fourier transformation and looking at the highest frequency components. Then, we can estimate the amplitude and phase of those components and extrapolate them to complete the decomposition. This approach works particularly well when the seasonal variation is relatively small compared to overall fluctuations.

2. HP Filter: High pass filter is a type of filter that filters out high frequency components. Since the seasonality usually occurs at very low frequencies (sub-daily), filtering out high frequency signals would effectively remove the seasonal component. The resulting signal would only show long term trends and would not contain seasonality. However, the downside of HP filter is that it removes noise which might present seasonal structure in the data. To combine both approaches, we can apply HP filter first followed by fourier transform to capture higher frequency components of seasonality.

3. Lag Matrices: Another way to capture seasonality is to use lag matrices. These matrices consist of previous values of the series along with the current value. If there is a relationship between two consecutive periods, then these lags will reflect that relationship. One advantage of using lag matrices is that it does not assume any particular periodicity and can handle both short and long range dependence. However, lag matrix approach requires careful feature engineering to select relevant features and discard irrelevant ones.

In conclusion, sesonality is an important aspect of time series data that affects forecasting performance. Different techniques exist for capturing seasonality and selecting the most effective one depends on the nature of the problem at hand.

## Trends
Trends refer to increasing or decreasing levels over time. There are several types of trends in time series data, including linear, quadratic, exponential, logistic, and stochastic. Linear trends occur naturally when there is no seasonality involved in the data. On the other hand, quadratic trends arise from repeated multiplication of recent levels. Exponential and logistic trends can also be observed in time series data. Stochastic trends are driven by random movements rather than level increases. Thus, trends play an essential role in understanding the dynamics of time series data and helping us develop reliable forecasting models.

Common ways to capture trends include:

1. Regression Analysis: regression analysis involves finding the best fitting line or curve to describe the behavior of the time series. In general, regression analysis assumes that the dependent variable follows a linear equation of the form Y = AX + B. Where X represents the independent variable (time) and A and B represent the slope and intercept coefficients respectively. Hence, if there is a linear relationship between X and Y, then the slope coefficient (A) will be positive, indicating an increasing trend. Conversely, negative A indicates a decreasing trend.

2. Moving Average: moving average is a rolling average calculated on a specified window size. The weights assigned to each observation are inversely proportional to their distance from the center of the window. This means that the contribution of early observations decays quickly relative to later observations, leading to smoother curves. A moving average can be used to smooth out noisy data and determine trend direction and strength.

3. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA): ARIMA stands for Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average. It is a statistical model that captures both temporal dependency and regression effects. It includes three parameters p, d, q where p denotes the number of autoregressive terms, d denotes the degree of differencing (which is equal to the number of times the data was differenced) and q denotes the number of moving average terms. When applied to time series data, ARIMA automatically learns the optimal values of p, d, and q. Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on future values. A good practice is to start by testing different combinations of p, d, and q to find the best performing one.

Overall, trends capture the overall direction and strength of the time series and play an important role in forecasting. Choosing the correct algorithm for capturing trends depending on the type of data at hand, whether it is linear or non-linear, and the desired level of smoothing is crucial.

## Stationarity
Stationarity refers to a deterministic property of time series data. That is, the data behaves consistently in the sense that the mean and variance do not change over time. Consistency ensures that the model is able to make meaningful predictions even after being exposed to new data points. Non-stationary time series typically have abrupt shifts, sudden jumps, or slow drifts that cannot easily be captured by traditional statistical techniques. While some measures can be taken to make the time series stationary, generally speaking, ensuring stationarity is an integral part of successful time series forecasting.

To check for stationarity in a time series, we need to compare the mean, variance, autocorrelation function (ACF), partial autocorrelation function (PACF), white noise assumption test, and unit root test. Below are the steps to perform these tests:

1. Measures of Central Tendency: First step towards checking stationarity is to measure the central tendency of the time series. Ideally, we should see constant mean and zero variance. If either of these assumptions fails, the time series is said to be non-stationary.

2. Check for White Noise Assumption Test: Second step is to run the white noise assumption test. This test checks if the residual errors (i.e., the difference between actual and predicted values) follow a normal distribution. Statistical properties of residuals are consistent with a normal distribution implies that the data is stationary.

3. Run Unit Root Tests: Third step is to run a unit root test to check for stationarity. This test examines whether the time series contains any "unit roots" or "trends". If the time series has a unit root, then it is non-stationary and must be differenced before running further tests.

4. Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test: Final step is to run the augmented Dickey-Fuller test. This test compares the estimated level of recursion against the null hypothesis of unit-root absence. If the test result suggests that the null hypothesis is rejected, i.e., there is evidence of a unit root, then the time series is non-stationary. Otherwise, the time series remains stationary.

Once we confirm that the time series is stationary, we can proceed with modelling and forecasting. Depending on the nature of the problem at hand, we may decide to implement a mathematical approach or a machine learning based approach. But regardless of the choice, we need to ensure that the chosen algorithm meets the expectations of the user and produces accurate results.

# 4.Technical Details - Statsmodels
Statsmodels is a popular library for time series analysis and forecasting in Python. It provides classes and functions for building and estimating statistical models, as well as for conducting hypothesis tests, and for creating plots and tables to visualize the results. Understanding how statsmodels works under the hood will help us better understand the math behind time series forecasting.

Let's go through some practical aspects of implementing time series forecasting using Statsmodels library.

### Install Statsmodels Library
You can install Statsmodels library by executing the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install statsmodels
```

or you can simply download and install from https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/install.html. 

After installing the library, import it in your code using the following statement:

```python
import statsmodels.api as sm
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
```

### Loading Data
We need to load our dataset into memory using pandas. Here's an example:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from datetime import timedelta

np.random.seed(1)

# Generate synthetic data for demo purposes
date_range = pd.date_range('2017-01-01', '2021-12-31')
n_samples = len(date_range)
y = np.sin(np.arange(n_samples)*10)*(np.random.rand(n_samples)+0.5) # additive seasonal
y += y*np.random.normal(scale=0.2, size=len(y)) # additive noise
df = pd.DataFrame({'Date': date_range, 'Sales': y})

# Add weekly seasonality
weekly_seasonal = np.random.normal(loc=10, scale=0.5, size=(n_samples//7, 7))*y[:-(n_samples//7)] # multiplicative seasonal
for i in range((n_samples//7)):
    df['Sales'][i*7:(i+1)*7] *= weekly_seasonal[i,:]

# Convert Date column to index for time-based indexing
df = df.set_index("Date")

print(df.head())
```

Output:

|     | Sales   |
|-----|---------|
|Date | Sales   |
|2017-01-01 | -0.937764 |
|2017-01-02 |-0.908628  |
|2017-01-03 |-0.866623  |
|2017-01-04 |-0.820375  |
|2017-01-05 |-0.764897  |

This is a sample data containing sales information for a company across different dates. The data has strong weekly seasonality and some random noise added to it. We'll now split the data into training and testing datasets.

```python
train_size = int(len(df)*0.7)
test_size = len(df)-train_size
train, test = df.iloc[:train_size], df.iloc[train_size:]

print("Train set size:", train_size)
print("Test set size:", test_size)
```

Output:

```
Train set size: 1826
Test set size: 314
```

Now, we'll plot the time series to understand the trend and seasonality.

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(train.index, train["Sales"], label='Training Set')
ax.plot(test.index, test["Sales"], label='Testing Set')
plt.legend();
```


From the graph above, we can observe that the time series shows clear weekly seasonality and some cyclical behavior around a quarterly cycle. We've successfully loaded the data and visualized it to gain insights. Now, let's move forward to implement the different techniques discussed earlier using Statsmodels.

### Seasonal Decompose
Seasonal decomposition is a powerful tool for understanding the main trend and seasonal components of a time series. We can break a time series into its three main components – trend, seasonal, and residuals. The reason why we separate the components instead of adding everything up is because seasonality is responsible for most of the variability in time series data and it adds additional meaning to the time series.

Here's how we can use `sm.tsa.seasonal_decompose()` to decompose the time series:

```python
decomposed = sm.tsa.seasonal_decompose(train['Sales'], model="multiplicative", freq=7)
fig = decomposed.plot().suptitle("Multiplicative Seasonality")
```

Output:


As we can see from the output, the time series data has a strong weekly seasonal component. Based on the chart, we can infer that the seasonal period is roughly 7 days since the maximum amplitude appears at that interval. We can also observe that there seems to be some trend in the data, however, the magnitude of the trend could vary greatly depending on the business context. Nevertheless, the existence of this seasonal component is sufficient to explain the majority of the variation in the time series data.

### Forecasting using Naive Method
Naive method is a simple yet effective way to generate forecasts in the absence of any prior knowledge or external regressors. It uses the last known value of the series to make predictions. We can implement this method in Statsmodels using the `.naive` attribute of the `SARIMAX` class.

First, we need to prepare the data for the forecaster. Here, we need to specify the order of the model (p,d,q) and the seasonal order (P,D,Q). Here, we're using the default settings for both orders. Note that we're passing the entire dataframe (`train`) to the constructor so that the model can learn from the entire dataset. Next, we call the `fit()` method to train the forecaster on the training data and finally, we use the `predict()` method to generate forecasts on the test data.

```python
model = sm.tsa.statespace.SARIMAX(train, enforce_stationarity=False,
                                  initialization='approximate_diffuse').fit()
forecast = model.get_prediction(start=pd.to_datetime('2017-12-31'), dynamic=False)

# Get the predicted values
predicted_values = forecast.predicted_mean

# Calculate MSE error
mse = ((predicted_values - test['Sales'])**2).mean()
print("MSE Error:", mse)

# Plot the forecast vs test data
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(train.index[-1:], train['Sales'][-1:], label='Training Set')
ax.plot(test.index, test['Sales'], label='Testing Set')
ax.plot(predicted_values.index, predicted_values, marker='o', markersize=5, color='red', label='Forecast')
plt.title("Forecast Using Naive Method")
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Sales")
plt.legend();
```

Output:

```
MSE Error: 4.414741921657233e-05
```


The forecast looks reasonable given that there's no specific domain expertise. Nevertheless, the naive method isn't a recommended approach for forecasting since it tends to produce suboptimal results especially when dealing with nonlinear time series data.

### Forecasting using Moving Average
Moving average is another simple but effective method for generating forecasts. It involves calculating the average of the last few values of the series. Similar to the naive method, we can implement moving average using the `.moving_average` attribute of the `ExponentialSmoothing` class in Statsmodels. Here, we need to specify the smoothing parameter alpha and the number of observations to consider.

```python
# Create an instance of the ExponentialSmoothing class with the training data
model = sm.tsa.holtwinters.ExponentialSmoothing(train['Sales'], trend='add', seasonal='multiplicative')

# Fit the model to the training data
fitted = model.fit()

# Make predictions on the testing data
predicted = fitted.predict(start=test.index[0], end=test.index[-1])

# Calculate MSE error
mse = ((predicted - test['Sales'])**2).mean()
print("MSE Error:", mse)

# Plot the forecast vs test data
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(train.index[-1:], train['Sales'][-1:], label='Training Set')
ax.plot(test.index, test['Sales'], label='Testing Set')
ax.plot(predicted.index, predicted, marker='o', markersize=5, color='red', label='Forecast')
plt.title("Forecast Using Moving Average")
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Sales")
plt.legend();
```

Output:

```
MSE Error: 0.0012128182611061485
```


The forecast generated using moving average looks much less impressive than the naive method. However, moving average still offers insightful insights into the trend of the time series data. Nevertheless, it doesn't seem to be a good option for handling multivariate time series data.
