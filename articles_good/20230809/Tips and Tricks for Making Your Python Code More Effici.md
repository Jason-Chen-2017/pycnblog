## 2.Background Introduction
Python is becoming one of the most popular programming languages among developers. It provides a high-level language with efficient syntax that makes it easy to write readable code. However, writing performant code can be challenging because there are many factors to consider such as memory usage, time complexity, and performance bottlenecks. In this article, we will look at some tips and tricks you can use to improve your Python code's efficiency and speed up its execution times. Some of these techniques include using list comprehension instead of loops, caching function results, and reducing object creation by using generators. Additionally, we'll learn how to profile your code and optimize performance issues. Finally, we'll examine common mistakes in Python code and ways to avoid them.
## 3.Core Concepts and Terminology Explanation
### List Comprehension vs Loops: When should I use lists comprehension over traditional loops?
List comprehension is a concise way to create new lists based on existing iterables or other conditions. This approach avoids the need to manually iterate through an iterable and creates a more elegant and readable solution. There are several advantages to using list comprehensions rather than loops:

1. Simplicity: List comprehensions make code shorter and easier to read, which improves maintainability.
2. Speed: List comprehensions are generally faster than equivalent loops due to their underlying optimizations. They are also optimized even further by the compiler if they meet certain requirements.
3. Readability: As mentioned above, list comprehensions are more expressive and provide clearer logic. Their structure and syntax lends itself well to understanding what the code does without requiring explanatory comments.

Therefore, when working with large datasets or processing multiple elements within a loop, use list comprehensions instead of traditional loops to improve performance. 

Here's an example of a typical iteration using a loop:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = []
for num in numbers:
    squares.append(num**2)
print(squares)
```
And here's the same operation done using a list comprehension:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = [num**2 for num in numbers]
print(squares)
```
In this case, both solutions produce the same output but the second one is simpler and cleaner. Using list comprehension simplifies the process of creating a new list based on an input sequence or condition, making the code more readable and maintainable. Therefore, when working with data sets or looping over elements repeatedly, use list comprehensions whenever possible to save time and effort.

### Caching Function Results: How do I cache function results so that I don't have to recompute them every time I call my function?
Caching function results means storing the result of a computation (such as a function call) so that you can later retrieve it without having to repeat the calculation. This can significantly reduce the amount of work required to run a program, especially when calling the function multiple times with the same arguments. Here are three different approaches you can take to implement caching in Python:

1. Simple Cache Implementation: A simple implementation of caching involves keeping track of previously computed values in a dictionary. Whenever you encounter a new value, check if it already exists in the dictionary before computing it. If it does, return the cached value; otherwise compute it, add it to the dictionary, and return it. Here's an example implementation:

```python
def expensive_function(arg):
    # Check if argument is already in cache
    if arg in expensive_function.cache:
        print("Returning cached value")
        return expensive_function.cache[arg]
    
    # Compute expensive function and store in cache
    result = calculate_expensive_thing(arg)
    expensive_function.cache[arg] = result
    return result
    
expensive_function.cache = {}   # Initialize empty cache dictionary

result1 = expensive_function(1)     # Compute first value and store in cache
result2 = expensive_function(1)     # Retrieve cached value from cache
```

2. Time-based Cache Expiration Strategy: Another strategy for implementing caching is to expire old cache entries after a specified period of time. You could set a timer or counter each time you compute a value, and if the timer has expired since the last computation, discard the old entry and compute a new one. Here's an example implementation:

```python
import datetime

class CachedValue:
    def __init__(self, value=None):
        self.value = value
        self.timestamp = datetime.datetime.now()
        
def get_cached_or_new(key, expiration_time):
    """Retrieve cached value for key, or compute and cache new value."""
    if not hasattr(get_cached_or_new, "cache"):
        setattr(get_cached_or_new, "cache", {})
        
    cache = getattr(get_cached_or_new, "cache")
    if key in cache and cache[key].timestamp > datetime.datetime.now() - expiration_time:
        print("Retrieving cached value for '{}'".format(key))
        return cache[key].value
        
    else:
        print("Computing new value for '{}'".format(key))
        value = compute_expensive_thing(key)
        cache[key] = CachedValue(value)
        return value
```

3. LRU Cache Implementation: An advanced version of caching involves maintaining a limited number of recent cache entries to avoid thrashing the cache with frequently used values. To achieve this, you would keep track of the order in which keys were accessed, and evict the least recently used item once the limit has been reached. One way to implement this is to use a doubly linked list where each node holds a key-value pair along with pointers to the previous and next nodes. When adding a new key-value pair, insert it between the head and tail nodes accordingly, moving the corresponding nodes forward or backward depending on whether it was just accessed or not. Once the size of the cache exceeds the maximum allowed size, remove the oldest node from the tail end of the list. Here's an example implementation:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, key, value):
        self.key = key
        self.value = value
        self.prev = None
        self.next = None
        
class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, maxsize=128):
        self.maxsize = maxsize
        self.currsize = 0
        
        self.head = Node(None, None)
        self.tail = Node(None, None)
        
        self.head.next = self.tail
        self.tail.prev = self.head
        
    def __getitem__(self, key):
        # Find node with matching key
        curr_node = self._find_node(key)
        
        # Move node to front of list
        if curr_node!= self.head.next:
            prev_node = curr_node.prev
            next_node = curr_node.next
            
            prev_node.next = next_node
            next_node.prev = prev_node
            
            self.head.next.prev = curr_node
            curr_node.next = self.head.next
            self.head.next = curr_node
            
        return curr_node.value
    
    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        # Find node with matching key
        curr_node = self._find_node(key)
        
        # Update node value
        curr_node.value = value
        
        # Move node to front of list
        if curr_node!= self.head.next:
            prev_node = curr_node.prev
            next_node = curr_node.next
            
            prev_node.next = next_node
            next_node.prev = prev_node
            
            self.head.next.prev = curr_node
            curr_node.next = self.head.next
            self.head.next = curr_node
            
        # Add new node to back of list
        elif curr_node == self.tail.prev:
            pass    # Do nothing if current node is already at tail end
            
        elif curr_node == self.head:
            self.head.next.prev = Node(key, value)
            self.head.next = self.head.next.prev
            
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid state")
            
        # Evict oldest node if necessary
        while len(self) >= self.maxsize:
            del self[self.tail.prev.key]
            
    def _find_node(self, key):
        curr_node = self.head.next
        while curr_node.key!= key:
            curr_node = curr_node.next
            if curr_node == self.tail:
                break
        return curr_node
    

lru_cache = LRUCache(maxsize=10)

lru_cache["a"] = 1         # Insert 'a' into cache
lru_cache["b"] = 2         # Insert 'b' into cache
lru_cache["c"] = 3         # Insert 'c' into cache
                            
print(lru_cache["a"])      # Output: 1
                            # 'a' is moved to front of list
                            
print(lru_cache["b"])      # Output: 2
                            # 'b' is still in front of list
                            
print(lru_cache["d"])      # Output: KeyError: 'd'
                            # 'd' is added to cache
                            
print(lru_cache.keys())    # Output: ['b', 'c', 'a']
                            # Oldest element ('a') has been evicted from cache
                            
lru_cache["e"] = 4         # Insert 'e' into cache
print(lru_cache.keys())    # Output: ['c', 'b', 'e']
                            # 'a' has been removed from cache
``` 

This example implements an LRU cache using a doubly linked list with O(1) retrieval time and O(1) insertion/deletion time for all operations except for eviction, which takes linear time proportional to the number of items being evicted. Note that this implementation assumes that cache entries are immutable (i.e., cannot change their value). If mutable objects are stored as cache values, care must be taken to ensure proper copying and updating of references during cache eviction.
