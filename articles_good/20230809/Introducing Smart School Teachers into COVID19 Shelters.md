        COVID-19 pandemic has caused a crisis in many aspects of our lives and has drastically affected the teaching world as well. As a teacher, I am experiencing tremendous difficulties dealing with this global challenge. Ever since schools closed due to COVID-19 lockdowns, many parents have been facing long wait times to get their kids back to school. Moreover, educational institutions are facing a critical time for preparing students for college/university entrance exams. Therefore, it is essential to find solutions that enable real-time telemedicine during COVID-19 shelter stays so that parents can have access to quality education during these remote sessions. 
        
       In this blog article, we will explore how a team of smart teachers from K-12 schools can help connect families and individuals with qualified teachers by enabling them to meet their pediatrician or primary care physician via virtual meetings through messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. We hope that this solution will provide high quality education during these distressed times while reducing the number of parental frustrations associated with waiting times for schools. We also propose an intelligent bot that can automatically guide the user towards using online resources such as YouTube and MOOCs during telemedicine meetings. Overall, this project aims at empowering both parents and teachers during COVID-19 situations and ensuring high quality education for children across all age groups.
       
       # 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology 
        * **Telemedicine:** A process of providing healthcare professionals with access to patients' medical records over the internet or other means. It involves clinicians receiving virtual visits by way of a computer-mediated communication tool rather than face-to-face appointments. It has become increasingly popular because of its ability to address disruptions to patient care and save costs for the medical system. There are various types of telemedicine programs available including video conferencing (VC), screen sharing, text chatting, etc.
       
        * **Video Conferencing (VC):** Video conferencing tools allow two or more participants to share their screens or cameras together. This enables doctors to see what each person sees during a consultation without needing to meet individually. One advantage of VC compared to traditional meetings is that the meeting room remains clean and comfortable throughout the entire session.
        
        * **Screen Sharing:** Screen sharing allows users to present their desktop or application window on one device and viewers to see the shared content simultaneously on another device connected to the same network. Using this feature, the doctor can interact directly with a student's screen to diagnose his or her symptoms and communicate with him or her via text messages or voice calls.
        
        * **Text Chatting:** Text chatting allows doctors and patients to exchange instantaneous information via SMS or iMessage. This can be helpful when the need for physical contact between the parties arises. For example, if there is a technical issue with a certain machine or a question regarding diagnosis needs clarification. Text chatting can be done using various mobile apps such as Whatsapp, Messenger, Viber, etc.
        
        * **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** AI refers to machines capable of performing tasks that require human intelligence. In telemedicine, AI systems can assist in finding the best treatment options for different diseases based on data analysis, feedback provided by medical professionals, and historical patterns of disease occurrence. 
        
        * **Bot:** Bot is a software agent that performs automated functions, often with the goal of interacting with humans. Bots typically use natural language processing techniques to understand and respond to input from users in real-time. We can leverage bots to automate some challenging parts of the telemedicine process such as locating nearby doctors, scheduling appointments, ordering medications, and managing payment methods.
        
        * **Shelters and Homelessness:** During the COVID-19 pandemic, homelessness and shelters have experienced dramatic changes in terms of numbers and infrastructure. Many residents are living in temporary accommodation facilities where they lack the mobility required to go to school or work. Even though the majority of people are not able to move freely during this time, schools have adapted to new ways of teaching that involve lessons being conducted virtually. However, accessing reliable mental health care during remote sessions requires a combination of support networks and online learning platforms.
        
        * **COVID-19 Testing Centres:** Over the past few months, numerous testing centres across the country have opened up their doors to the general public. These centres offer free COVID-19 tests to anyone who desires one, making them highly accessible during this period. The availability of tests increases exponentially as doses become available throughout the day.
         
        * **YouTube and MOOCs:** Youtube is a platform for hosting videos and music online. It provides a vast collection of educational resources ranging from tutorials to instructional courses. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are similar but offer a higher degree of flexibility and engagement for learners. Both channels provide a wide range of topics related to STEM fields such as physics, mathematics, biology, chemistry, and computing science.
         
       # 3. Core Algorithm and Operations Steps  
       ## 3.1 Background Information 
       ### 3.1.1 Problem Statement 
       During the COVID-19 pandemic, schools have been closing down causing significant disruption in family life and education. According to statistics provided by World Health Organization (WHO), nearly half of all cases reported across the globe were linked to schools in developing countries. As a result, most parents cannot attend school anymore and struggle to keep their children engaged in classroom activities and university exams. To combat this situation, we need to develop technologies and services that enable parents to stay connected with their loved ones during these remote sessions.

       While most of the technological advancements have come from artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR), social media platforms, and cloud-based computing services, digital transformation still poses significant challenges. While VR technology is very promising and enabled applications like Google Glass and Amazon Sumerian to provide immersive, realistic experiences for consumers, AR headsets are still relatively untested and may pose safety risks. As an alternative, we aim to implement real-time telemedicine solutions leveraging the existing infrastructure and knowledge base of local community members. 

       At first glance, connecting adult volunteers with families and individuals with skills and experience in child psychiatry could seem like a daunting task. However, with the right approach and planning, we can achieve significant benefits for educational purposes. By establishing a personal touch between adult volunteers and families, we can reduce stress levels and improve overall communication and relationship building. Additionally, we can create an intelligent bot that can guide the user towards online resources such as YouTube and MOOCs. Finally, by centralizing location tracking mechanisms and integrating existing support networks, we can ensure that even those who are unable to leave their houses can participate in real-time telemedicine sessions and benefit from high quality education.

       ## 3.2 Solution Approach  
        We plan to use the following steps to build a successful implementation of real-time telemedicine:

        * Step 1: Develop a survey to identify eligible families and individual volunteers willing to provide telehealth services.
        * Step 2: Identify areas where current infrastructure exists and evaluate feasibility of implementing additional resources for telehealth operations.
        * Step 3: Plan logistical arrangements and organize teams to coordinate efforts and coordinate volunteer efforts within regions.
        * Step 4: Implement an AI algorithmic framework to recommend appropriate treatments, triage cases, and manage payments.
        * Step 5: Create an intuitive interface design for telehealth appointment booking, messaging, and online resources.
        * Step 6: Evaluate metrics to measure success rates and improvements against target outcomes.
        * Step 7: Continuously monitor and refine iterative improvements based on stakeholder feedback.

                  }, 500
       
       return jsonify({"message": "Failed to add volunteer"}), 500

   
   @app.route('/api/available_doctors/<string:lat>/<string:lng>', methods=['GET'])
   def available_doctors(lat, lng):
       url = f"https://www.google.com/search?q={lat},{lng}&client=chromium&channel=fs&hl=en&authuser=0&tbm=lcl&tbs=li:1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiRo4KDtYjuAhWVGuYKHUhZAnwQpwV6BAgHEAE&biw=1920&bih=925"
