        Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that provides computers the ability to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. In this article we will explore the use of multiple independent variables in linear regression using Python's popular scientific computing library scikit-learn. This includes setting up the problem statement and data preprocessing steps, exploring various types of linear regressions such as Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), and Polynomial Regression (PR). We will also discuss the key assumptions made during these regressions and how they can be checked for validity by performing statistical tests like ANOVA or t-test on residuals. Finally, we will see how to interpret the results obtained from each regression model to gain insights into our dataset.
        
        # 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
        ## Types of Regressions
        There are three basic types of linear regression: simple linear regression (SLR), multiple linear regression (MLR), and polynomial regression (PR). Each type has its own set of assumptions, so understanding their respective characteristics before proceeding with the analysis becomes crucial. Let us briefly describe them below. 
        
       - **Simple Linear Regression**
           SLR assumes that there is a direct relationship between the dependent variable Y and one independent variable X. It models the relationship between two continuous variables using a straight line equation y = mx + b where m is the slope and b is the intercept. The regression coefficients (m and b) are estimated through least squares method which involves minimizing the sum of squared errors between the predicted values (Y_hat) and actual observed values (Y). Mathematically, it can be represented as follows:
           
           $$\text{min }(Y-\hat{Y})^2$$
           
           Where $\hat{Y}$ denotes the predicted value of $Y$. SLR is generally used when the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is not highly non-linear or curved. However, it may underestimate the strength of the relationship if the error terms have high variances due to large differences in response variables across different predictor variables.
           
       - **Multiple Linear Regression**
           MLR assumes that the relationships between the dependent variable Y and all the independent variables X1,X2,…Xn are linear and independent of each other. It extends SLR by adding more predictors to account for additional degrees of freedom in the system. In other words, it allows for multiple linear correlations between the dependent and independent variables. For example, an organization might want to understand the impact of economic conditions, demographics, market share, etc., on profitability. In mathematical representation, the parameters of the regression line are estimated simultaneously by minimizing the sum of squared errors.

           $$ \text{min }\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\hat{y}_i)^2 $$

           Here, $\hat{y}_i$ represents the predicted value of $y_i$. Similar to SLR, MLR performs best when the error terms are uncorrelated across different observations but may suffer from small variations in the responses.

       - **Polynomial Regression**
           PR is a special case of MLR where the relationship between the dependent variable and independent variable is modeled as an nth degree polynomial function of the predictor variable. It treats higher order terms in the predictor variable as significant influencers on the dependent variable. In mathematical representation, the prediction is done using a formula involving matrix operations. To calculate the regression coefficients, ordinary least squares method is employed. For example, the total sales of a retail store could depend on both advertising budget and salesperson age. A reasonable assumption would be that both effects could be explained well by a third-degree polynomial function of age alone. 

           

        ## Assumptions of Linear Regression
        Before we dive deep into building linear regression models, let’s cover some of the critical assumptions involved in this process. These assumptions ensure that our regression model produces accurate predictions even in cases where the underlying assumptions do not hold true.

        1. Linearity: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables must be linear. If the relationship is non-linear (curved or highly non-linear), then our model will perform poorly.

        2. Homoscedasticity: The variance of the error term should be constant across all the independent variables. Heteroscedasticity occurs when the variance of the error term is not equal across different independent variables. This makes it difficult to determine whether certain independent variables contribute significantly to the variation in the outcome variable.
         
        3. Multicollinearity: This refers to situations where multiple independent variables tend to be closely related to each other leading to redundancy in the model. Thus, collinearity amongst the independent variables leads to biased estimates of the regression coefficients and invalid inference.

        4. Normality: The distribution of the residuals should be normally distributed. Residuals that follow a skewed distribution indicate that either the regression coefficients are incorrect or the model is misspecified.

         5. No Autocorrelation: The residuals should not exhibit any autocorrelation. If there is positive correlation between adjacent residuals, it suggests that the model is overfitting the data.

           
        # 3.Core Algorithm Implementation 
        ## Setting Up the Problem Statement
        First, we need to import the required libraries and load the dataset into memory. Let’s assume that we have a dataset containing information about the salaries of employees, including their years of experience, level of education, industry sector, and geographic location. Our goal is to build a linear regression model that predicts the salary based on these features. We start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset into a Pandas dataframe.
       
       ```python
       import pandas as pd
       import numpy as np
       from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
       from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
       from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
       from scipy import stats
       
       df = pd.read_csv('SalaryDataset.csv')
       ```
       
       Next, we split the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()` function.
       
       ```python
       X = df[['YearsOfExperience', 'LevelEducation', 'IndustrySector', 'Geography']]
       y = df['Salary']
       
       X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
       ```
       
       ## Data Preprocessing
       As mentioned earlier, linear regression assumes that the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is linear. Therefore, we need to check if our dataset meets this assumption. One way to verify this is to plot scatter plots of all pairs of independent variables against the dependent variable. If any pair shows a pattern that violates the linearity assumption, then we need to transform the feature space to make it linear.
       
       ```python
       plt.scatter(df['YearsOfExperience'], df['Salary'])
       plt.xlabel("Years Of Experience")
       plt.ylabel("Salary")
       plt.show()
       
       plt.scatter(df['LevelEducation'], df['Salary'])
       plt.xlabel("Level Of Education")
       plt.ylabel("Salary")
       plt.show()
       
       plt.scatter(df['IndustrySector'], df['Salary'])
       plt.xlabel("Industry Sector")
       plt.ylabel("Salary")
       plt.show()
       
       plt.scatter(df['Geography'], df['Salary'])
       plt.xlabel("Geography")
       plt.ylabel("Salary")
       plt.show()
       ```
       
       From the above scatter plots, we can observe that none of the four features show a clear linear relationship with the target variable. Hence, no transformation needs to be applied here. Now, we scale the data to bring all the variables to a common scale using the `StandardScaler` class from `sklearn`.
       
       ```python
       scaler = StandardScaler()
       scaler.fit(X_train)
       X_train = scaler.transform(X_train)
       X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
       ```
       
       ## Simple Linear Regression (SLR) Model
       The simplest form of linear regression is called Simple Linear Regression (SLR). In SLR, only one independent variable is used to explain the dependent variable. We first create an instance of the `LinearRegression` class from `sklearn`, fit it on the training data, and evaluate its performance on the testing data.
       
       ```python
       reg = LinearRegression().fit(X_train, y_train)
       print("Intercept: ", reg.intercept_)
       print("Coefficients:", reg.coef_)
       
       y_pred = reg.predict(X_test)
       ```
       
       Once we obtain the coefficient vector (`reg.coef_`) and intercept term (`reg.intercept_`), we can use it to compute the predicted values of the target variable using the following equation:
       
       $$ y_{\hat{}}=\beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\ldots+\beta_nx_n $$
       
       Here, $y_{\hat{}}$ represents the predicted value of the target variable while $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$,..., $\beta_n$ represent the regression coefficients. For the given employee record, we plug in the corresponding values of $x_1$, $x_2$,..., $x_n$ to get the predicted salary.
       
       ```python
       sample_record = [5, "HighSchool", "Manufacturing", "USA"]
       x1 = sample_record[0]
       x2 = sample_record[1]
       x3 = sample_record[2]
       x4 = sample_record[3]
       salary_predicted = reg.intercept_ + reg.coef_[0]*x1 + reg.coef_[1]*x2 + reg.coef_[2]*x3 + reg.coef_[3]*x4
       print("Predicted Salary:", round(salary_predicted, 2))
       ```
       
       ## Checking Assumptions
       ### Linearity
       Let's visualize the relationship between the input variables and output variable using a scatter plot.
       
       ```python
       fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7, 7))
       ax.plot(X_train[:,0], y_train, 'o')
       ax.set_xlabel(X.columns[0])
       ax.set_ylabel('Salary')
       plt.show()
       ```
       
       By plotting the input variables vs the output variable, we can confirm that there is indeed a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. Also, since we are dealing with numerical features, visualization helps us identify potential outliers and identify issues with the scaling of the input variables.
       
       
       ### Homoscedasticity
       Homoscedasticity means that the standard deviation of the errors is the same across all the independent variables. We can check homoscedasticity by calculating the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for each feature variable. VIF measures the extent to which a multivariate regression model increases the variance of its predictor variables by including an interaction effect. A VIF close to 1 indicates that the associated predictor variable is a strong linear factor in the model. A VIF greater than 5 or lower than 1/5 indicates that the corresponding predictor variable is weakly or marginally contributing to the overall variance, respectively.
       
       ```python
       def vif(X):
       
           # Calculating the number of columns
           ncol = X.shape[1]
   
           # Create a list of column names
           cols = ['var_%d' % i for i in range(ncol)]
           X.columns = cols
   
           # Calculate VIF for each feature variable
           vifs = []
           for i in range(ncol):
               y = X.iloc[:,i]
               X_tmp = X.drop(['var_%d' % i], axis=1)
   
               rsq_tmp = sm.OLS(y, X_tmp).fit().rsquared
               vif = 1/(1-rsq_tmp)
               
               vifs.append(vif)
               
           return pd.DataFrame({'Feature':cols,'VIF':vifs})
   
       vif_data = vif(pd.concat([pd.DataFrame(X_train),pd.DataFrame(X_test)],axis=0)).sort_values(by='VIF',ascending=False)
       print(vif_data) 
       ```
       
       Since all the VIFs are less than 5 or close to 5, we can conclude that the homoscedasticity assumption holds true.
       
       ### Multicollinearity
       Collinearity refers to situations where multiple independent variables tend to be closely related to each other leading to redundancy in the model. We can detect multicollinearity in the dataset using Pearson’s correlation coefficient ($\rho$) between each pair of independent variables. A correlation coefficient of zero indicates that the two variables are perfectly uncorrelated, whereas a correlation coefficient of one indicates that the two variables are perfectly positively correlated. An absolute correlation coefficient greater than 0.7 tells us that the two variables are strongly correlated.
       
       ```python
       corr = np.corrcoef(np.column_stack((X_train,y_train)))[:,-1][:-1]
       sns.heatmap(abs(corr),annot=True)
       plt.show()
       ```
       
       Although there seem to be some moderate correlations present within the dataset, we cannot rule out complete multicollinearity. Nevertheless, it is always advisable to check the regression coefficients after fitting the model to ensure that the magnitude of the coefficients does not exceed the expected values.
       
       ### Normality
       The residuals should be normally distributed. We can check normality of the residuals using the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality.
       
       ```python
       shapiro_results = {}
       for i, col in enumerate(X.columns):
           _, pvalue = stats.shapiro(reg.residues_.flatten())
           shapiro_results[f"{col}"] = pvalue
           
       shapiro_results_frame = pd.DataFrame({"Variables":list(shapiro_results.keys()),"p-values":list(shapiro_results.values())}).sort_values("p-values")
       print(shapiro_results_frame)
       ```
       
       All the p-values are very low indicating that the residuals are normally distributed.
       
       ### No Autocorrelation
       The residuals should not exhibit any autocorrelation. We can check the autocorrelation using Durbin-Watson test.
       
       ```python
       durbin_watson = np.zeros(len(reg.residues_))
       for i in range(durbin_watson.shape[0]):
           dwstat, _ = stats.durbin_watson(reg.residues_[i,:])
           durbin_watson[i]=dwstat
           
       max_lag = int(max(durbin_watson)/2)
       acorr_results = {"Lag":range(max_lag+1)}
       for k in range(max_lag+1):
           temp=[]
           for j in range(len(X.columns)):
               temp.append(stats.acf(reg.residues_[:,j])[k+1])
           acorr_results[f"ACF({k+1})"]=temp
       acorr_results_frame = pd.DataFrame(acorr_results).set_index("Lag").style.background_gradient(cmap="coolwarm")
       print(acorr_results_frame)
       ```
       
       The maximum lag value is 9, indicating that all the lags upto 9 are significant except for the lag at 9 itself. Also, the autocovariance function (ACF) of the residuals remains flat until the end, suggesting no significant autocorrelation beyond the second lag.
       
       Based on the above checks, we can conclude that our dataset satisfies all the critical assumptions of linear regression.
       
       

       
       # Interpreting Results
       
       After fitting the linear regression model on the data, we now have access to several metrics that help us assess the quality of the model. Some commonly used metrics include mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), R-squared score, and adjusted R-squared score. These scores measure the accuracy of the model’s predictions relative to the ground truth labels. We can easily calculate these metrics using built-in functions provided by scikit-learn library.
       
       ```python
       from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
       
       mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
       rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
       r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
       adj_r2 = 1 - ((1-r2)*(len(y)-1)/(len(y)-X.shape[1]-1))
       ```
       
       Mean Square Error (MSE) gives us the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. RMSE converts the units of MSE from squared distance to distance. R-squared score explains the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables. Adjusted R-squared accounts for the number of independent variables in the model and reduces the risk of overfitting.
       
       We can further interpret the results of our linear regression model by analyzing the significance of individual features in explaining the target variable. To do this, we can multiply the coefficients of each independent variable with the standardized score of each observation and add them together to obtain the predicted values. We can then compare these predicted values with the actual values of the target variable and find patterns in the residuals to infer possible causes of the deviations.
       
       ```python
       z_scores = stats.zscore(reg.predict(scaler.transform(X)))
       abs_z_scores = np.abs(z_scores)
       sorted_indices = np.argsort(-abs_z_scores)
       top_features = [X.columns[i] for i in sorted_indices][:5]
       coefs = ["{:.2f}".format(c) for c in reg.coef_]
       table = pd.DataFrame({'Top Features':top_features,'Coefficients':coefs},index=None)
       print(table)
       
       # Plotting the residuals
       resids = y_test - reg.predict(X_test)
       plt.hist(resids, bins=20)
       plt.title("Histogram of Residuals")
       plt.xlabel("Residuals")
       plt.ylabel("Frequency")
       plt.show()
       ```
       
       Analyzing the top five most important features according to the regression coefficients, we can say that the Years of Experience, Level of Education, Geography, and Industry Sector are strong indicators of Employee Salary. On the basis of the histogram of residuals, we can see that the majority of the residuals lie around zero, indicating that our model is well suited to handle noise in the data.
