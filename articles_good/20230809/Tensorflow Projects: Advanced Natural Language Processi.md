      ## Introduction to Natural Language Processing
      ### What is Natural Language Processing?
      Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the ability of computers and machines to understand human languages. When we talk about natural language, we usually mean spoken or written words that convey meaning through sound and gesture. However, language is actually made up of multiple parts: phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. 
      
     These aspects determine how different words interact with each other to form phrases, sentences, paragraphs, and entire documents. With the advent of big data technologies, machine learning algorithms have been developed that allow us to process large amounts of unstructured data quickly and accurately.
     
       ### Why Use NLP?
      
      Natural language processing technology has several advantages over traditional methods such as regular expressions and lexical analysis. They offer several unique features that make them particularly suitable for various types of tasks, including information retrieval, automated summarization, speech recognition, question answering systems, sentiment analysis, and fraud detection. Here are just some of the key benefits of NLP:
        
        1. Gain Insights from Unstructured Text Data
        
        2. Automate Complex Information Retrieval Tasks
        
        3. Build Applications That Can Interact with Users
        
        4. Improve Business Performance Through Better Customer Feedback Analysis
        
        5. Provide Accurate Sentiment Analysis Services
        
        There are many real-world applications where NLP is being applied today. From medical record analysis to online customer feedback analysis, financial reporting, search engine optimization, and social media analytics, research shows that NLP plays a crucial role in driving businesses forward.
         
         ## Project Overview
         Our goal in this project is to implement advanced natural language processing techniques using TensorFlow libraries. Specifically, we will focus on implementing deep neural network models for sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, topic modeling, and document classification. We will learn how to preprocess text data for training and evaluation, train deep neural network models, visualize and interpret model results, and fine-tune the models for better accuracy.
         
          ## 3. Core Concepts and Terminology
          ## Preprocessing Text Data
          Let's dive into preprocessing text data for training and evaluation. Text data needs to undergo some cleaning and preprocessing procedures before it can be fed into a deep neural network model for training or evaluation. This involves converting the raw input text into tokens, removing stopwords, stemming or lemmatizing words, and converting the processed text into numeric vectors that can be fed into the model. These steps ensure that the input data is well-suited for training and evaluation while providing insights into the underlying patterns and relationships present in the data.
            
          ### Tokenization
          Tokenization is the process of breaking down text data into individual terms or words. Tokens are the basic units that represent words and sentences in a given text corpus. There are several tokenization approaches available, such as whitespace splitting, character based splittings, and sentence boundary detection. Whitespace splitting splits the text into words whenever there is a space between characters. Character based tokenizations break down the text into smaller chunks, either based on spaces or punctuation marks. Sentence boundary detection identifies the boundaries between two sentences within the text. 
            
          ### Stopword Removal
          Stopwords are commonly occurring words that do not provide much contextual significance in a given text dataset. Removing these words reduces noise and improves the quality of the text representation. Common stopwords include articles (the, a, an), conjunctions (and, but, or, yet), pronouns (he, she, his, hers), determiners (this, that, these, those), common nouns (book, man, dog), and prepositions (in, on, at).  
            
          ### Stemming vs Lemmatization
          Stemming and Lemmatization both aim to reduce words to their base forms, but they differ in the way they achieve this. Lemmatization relies on the context of the word and encodes relevant grammatical categories. Stemming simply chops off the ends of words without knowing anything else about the word except its part of speech. Thus, stemming leads to diminished accuracy compared to lemmatization when dealing with inflectional words. Therefore, it is essential to choose the right approach based on the nature of the text data and the task at hand. 
              
          ### Conversion to Numeric Vectors
          Finally, once the cleaned and preprocessed text data is converted into tokens, we need to convert it into numeric vectors so that it can be fed into a deep neural network model for training or evaluation. One popular method for converting text to numeric vector format is Word Embeddings.
              
              Word Embeddings
              Word embeddings are dense representations of words in vector space, trained on large datasets. Each word is represented as a dense vector of fixed size, where the values along the vector dimensions capture the importance of that particular word in relation to other words.
              
              The idea behind word embeddings is that similar words should appear closer to each other in vector space than dissimilar ones. This means that words that co-occur often during training will be close together in vector space.
              
              TensorFlow provides a built-in implementation of word embeddings that can be easily integrated into our NLP workflows.
                
              Another option for representing text data as numeric vectors is Bag-of-Words model. In this approach, each document is treated as a bag of words, consisting of all the distinct words in the document. Each document is represented as a sparse binary vector, with a single nonzero entry for every distinct word in the collection.
              
          ## 4. Sentiment Analysis Using Deep Neural Networks
          Now that we've covered the basics of natural language processing and preprocessing text data, let's move on to sentiment analysis using deep neural networks. As mentioned earlier, sentiment analysis is one of the most important tasks in natural language processing. Sentiment analysis analyzes user feedback, product reviews, and social media posts to predict whether someone's opinion is positive, negative, or neutral.
        
            ### Representing Text as Inputs to Models
            Since our objective is to implement sentiment analysis using deep neural networks, we first need to come up with a way to represent the text inputs as tensors that can be fed into the model. The simplest approach is to use the Bag-of-Words model discussed earlier, where each document is represented as a sparse binary vector. In this case, each document consists of all the distinct words in the vocabulary.
            
            Alternatively, we could use word embeddings as described earlier to represent the text data. Word embeddings map each word to a dense vector of fixed length, where each dimension corresponds to a specific semantic feature captured by the word embedding algorithm. This allows the model to capture contextual relationships between words and infer implicit sentiment information.
            
            Either way, we need to convert the text data into numerical tensors that can be fed into the model as inputs. Once we obtain these tensors, we can then define our deep neural network architecture and train it using the provided labeled data.
            
             ### Defining the Model Architecture
            Next, we need to define the model architecture. We'll use a shallow LSTM architecture followed by fully connected layers for sentiment analysis. The LSTM layer takes in the input sequence, processes it sequentially, and produces an output vector that captures temporal and sequential information. We then pass this output vector through a fully connected layer with ReLU activation function and dropout regularization to introduce some regularization to prevent overfitting. We then add another fully connected layer with softmax activation function to produce the final sentiment scores.
            
            
            ### Training and Evaluation
            Finally, after defining the model architecture, we can train it using the provided labeled data. During training, we feed mini-batches of text sequences and corresponding labels to the model, and the optimizer updates the weights of the model parameters based on the loss gradient. We repeat this process for several epochs until the model achieves satisfactory performance.
            
            During evaluation, we evaluate the performance of the trained model on a separate validation set, and compute metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix. We can also visualize the intermediate predictions generated by the model during training using tools like TensorBoard.
            
            
            ### Transfer Learning
            Transfer learning is a technique that enables a model to leverage a pre-existing model's knowledge and transfer it to a new task. In our case, we're going to apply transfer learning to our sentiment analysis model by initializing the weights of our new model using the weights of a pre-trained word embedding model. This helps to avoid redundant training and speed up the training time.
            
            While performing transfer learning, we keep the top layers of the original model frozen and only update the bottom layers of the model to fit our new task. By freezing the weights of the pre-trained model, we preserve the features learned by the model and prevent it from adapting to our new task's requirements.
            
            
        ## 5. Named Entity Recognition Using Deep Neural Networks
        
        Now that we've implemented sentiment analysis using deep neural networks, let's move on to named entity recognition using deep neural networks. Named entity recognition (NER) is a task of extracting relevant entities from text such as people, organizations, locations, and times. Let's see how we can perform NER using deep neural networks.
        
        
        ### Dataset
        
        We'll use the CoNLL 2003 English dataset for NER. This dataset contains annotated examples of various types of named entities, including persons, organizations, locations, and times.
        
        The CONLL 2003 dataset is divided into three files: training, testing, and development sets. The training set contains annotations for 96% of the sentences, while the test and development sets contain annotations for the remaining 4% and 1%, respectively. The test and development sets are held out for evaluation purposes, while the training set is used to train our model. 
        
        
        ### Loading the Data
        
        First, we load the dataset using the `tensorflow_datasets` module. Then, we extract the sentences and corresponding tags from the dataset using the `tf.data.Dataset` class. We tokenize the sentences and pad them to a fixed length using the `tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences()` function. Finally, we convert the padded sentences and tags to TensorFlow tensors using the `tf.convert_to_tensor()` function.
        
        ```python
        import tensorflow as tf
        import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
        
        def tokenize_sentence(text):
            return [token.lower() for token in text.split()]
        
        def ner_preprocessor(example):
            sentences = []
            tags = []

            for i, sentence in enumerate(example['tokens']):
                tag_dict = {}

                for j, (token, tag) in enumerate(zip(sentence, example['ner_tags'][i])):
                    tokenized_sentence = tokenize_sentence(token)

                    for k, sub_token in enumerate(tokenized_sentence):
                        if sub_token in ['[CLS]', '[SEP]']:
                            continue

                        if sub_token not in tag_dict:
                            tag_dict[sub_token] = {tag}
                        elif len(tag_dict[sub_token]) == 1:
                            tag_dict[sub_token].add(f"B-{tag}")
                            tag_dict[sub_token].update([f"I-{t}" for t in tag_dict[sub_token]])
                        else:
                            tag_dict[sub_token].add("I-" + tag)
                            
                token_tags = ["[CLS]"]
                
                for _, v in sorted(tag_dict.items(), key=lambda x: x[0]):
                    token_tags += list(v)
                    
                token_tags.append("[SEP]")
                
                sentences.append(["[CLS]"] + tokenized_sentence + ["[SEP]"])
                tags.append(token_tags)
                
            padded_sentences = tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences([[tokenizer.vocab_size]] * len(sentences), padding='post')
            padded_tags = tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences([[len(unique_labels)]] * len(tags), padding='post', value=-100)
            
            sentences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(sentences)
            sentences = [[tokenizer.vocab_size]] + sentences + [[tokenizer.vocab_size]]
            sentences = tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(sentences, maxlen=max_seq_length, padding="post", truncating="post")
            
            tags = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(tags, num_classes=len(unique_labels))
            tags = tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(tags, maxlen=max_seq_length, padding="post", truncating="post")
            
            return {'sentences': sentences, 'padded_sentences': padded_sentences}, {'tags': tags, 'padded_tags': padded_tags}
        
        dataset, info = tfds.load('conll2003', split=['train'], with_info=True)
        vocab_file = os.path.join(info.data_dir, "co.txt")
        tokenizer = tfds.features.text.SubwordTextEncoder.build_from_corpus((line.strip() for line in tf.io.gfile.GFile(vocab_file)), target_vocab_size=2**13)
        max_seq_length = 128
        unique_labels = set(['O'] + info.features["ner_tags"].feature.names)

        train_dataset = dataset['train'].map(preprocess_fn, num_parallel_calls=tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE)
        train_dataset = train_dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=1000)
        train_dataset = train_dataset.batch(batch_size, drop_remainder=True)
        train_dataset = train_dataset.prefetch(tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE)
        ```
        
        ### Defining the Model Architecture
        
        Next, we define the model architecture using Keras. We use a Bidirectional LSTM layer followed by a TimeDistributed layer to get a fixed sized output for each token in the input sequence. We then pass the output through a fully connected layer with Softmax activation function to produce the final prediction for each label.
        
        
        ```python
        from keras.layers import Input, Dense, Embedding, SpatialDropout1D, Bidirectional, LSTM, TimeDistributed
        from keras.models import Model
        
        input_layer = Input(shape=(max_seq_length,), name='input')
        emb_layer = Embedding(input_dim=tokenizer.vocab_size+1, output_dim=embed_size)(input_layer)
        sp_drp_layer = SpatialDropout1D(0.4)(emb_layer)
        bi_lstm_layer = Bidirectional(LSTM(units=hidden_size//2, return_sequences=True))(sp_drp_layer)
        td_layer = TimeDistributed(Dense(units=len(unique_labels), activation='softmax'))(bi_lstm_layer)
        
        model = Model(inputs=[input_layer], outputs=[td_layer])
        model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
        model.summary()
        ```
        
        ### Training and Evaluating the Model
        
        Finally, we train and evaluate the model using the provided training and validation data. We use categorical cross entropy as the loss function and Adam optimizer to minimize the loss. We monitor the validation accuracy metric and save the best performing model during training.
        
        ```python
        history = model.fit(x={'sentences': train_set[:, :max_seq_length]}, y={'tags': train_set[:, max_seq_length:]}, batch_size=batch_size, 
                            epochs=num_epochs, verbose=1, callbacks=[EarlyStopping(monitor='val_acc', patience=patience)], 
                            validation_data=({'sentences': val_set[:, :max_seq_length]}, {'tags': val_set[:, max_seq_length:]}))
        ```
        
        ### Making Predictions
        
        Once we've trained and evaluated the model, we can use it to make predictions on new data samples. We simply preprocess the new sample using the same preprocessor function defined earlier, and feed it to the model for inference.
        
        ```python
        pred_sample = preprocess_fn({'sentences': np.array([test_sentence]), 'padded_sentences': np.array([[tokenizer.vocab_size]*max_seq_length])})
        predicted_label = np.argmax(model.predict(**pred_sample)[0][0], axis=-1)
        ```
        
        ## 6. Topic Modeling Using Deep Neural Networks
        
        Now that we've covered sentiment analysis and named entity recognition, let's move on to topic modeling using deep neural networks. Topic modeling aims to identify latent topics in a corpus of text data. Topics describe groups of related words that frequently appear together. In this section, we'll discuss what topic modeling is, why it's important, and how we can perform topic modeling using deep neural networks.
        
    
        ### Introduction to Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
        
        Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a popular statistical model for topic modeling. LDA builds upon the probabilistic generative model of topic models by introducing a hidden variable called the "topics". The topics capture the core ideas and concepts that are expressed in the text data.
        
        Given a document, the LDA model follows a generative process to generate the probability distributions of the words in the document. At each step, it selects a topic randomly from the predefined number of possible topics, and assigns each word in the document to that topic with a certain probability. The probabilities depend on the frequency of the word in the overall corpus and the presence of the current word in the selected topic.
        
        Based on the relative frequencies of words across the topics, the model can recover the true underlying structure of the text data. Moreover, since each document is assigned to exactly one topic, we can use the topics to group related documents together and study the trends and patterns of interest across the topics.
        
        ### LDA Algorithm
        
        The LDA model uses variational Bayes to approximate the posterior distribution of the model parameters. The main assumption of the model is that the observed variables (i.e., the words in the document) are generated independently by some mixture distribution conditioned on the unknown variables (i.e., the latent topics).
        
        The variational approximation involves expressing the joint distribution over the variables in terms of lower dimensional latent variables, and then optimizing the lower dimensional parameters to match the observed data. In practice, we optimize the parameters iteratively using stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation.
        
        The LDA model works as follows:
        1. Randomly initialize K topics and assign each word in the corpus to one of the K topics.
        2. Repeat the following iterations M times:
            1. E-step: Compute the expected counts of the words in the topics for each iteration.
            2. M-step: Update the topic assignments based on the expected counts computed in the previous step, and adjust the priors for the topics based on the collected statistics from the E-step.
        
        ### Defining the Model Architecture
        
        Next, we define the model architecture using Keras. We use a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for topic modeling. VAE is a type of autoencoder that learns the probability distribution of the encoded data instead of directly generating the output. In other words, the VAE model trains the encoder to find the optimal representation of the input data, while the decoder generates the reconstructed input.
        
        The VAE model follows the standard encoder-decoder architecture, where the input data is compressed into a latent space using an encoder function, and then decoded back to the original data using a decoder function. The VAE model adds a constraint on the likelihood function that forces the encoder to encode meaningful latent factors.
        
        The encoder component of the VAE model maps the input data to a set of independent and identically distributed (iid) Gaussian random variables. The mean and variance of each Gaussian variable determine the central point and spread of the corresponding latent factor. The decoder component decomposes the latent factors back to the original input space, and the likelihood function ensures that the decoding process matches the original input data closely.
        
        In this case, we use a bidirectional GRU unit as the encoder and a GRU unit followed by a fully connected layer as the decoder. The size of the GRU units and the latent space dimensions can be adjusted based on the complexity of the input data and the desired level of compression.
        
        ```python
        from keras.layers import Input, Lambda, Dense
        from keras.models import Model
        
        input_layer = Input(shape=(max_seq_length,), name='input')
        z_mean, z_var, z = encoder_z(input_layer)
        kl_loss = 1 + z_var - tf.square(z_mean) - tf.exp(z_var)
        kl_loss = -0.5 * tf.reduce_sum(kl_loss, axis=-1)
        x_pred = decoder_x(z)
        vae = Model(inputs=[input_layer], outputs=[x_pred, kl_loss])
        ```
        
        ### Training and Evaluating the Model
        
        Finally, we train and evaluate the model using the provided training and validation data. We use binary cross entropy as the loss function and ADAM optimizer to minimize the loss. We monitor the validation ELBO metric and save the best performing model during training.
        
        ```python
        vae.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=['binary_crossentropy', lambda y_true, y_pred: y_pred])
        hist = vae.fit([train_set[:, :max_seq_length]], [{'output1': train_set[:, :max_seq_length]}, {"output2": np.zeros(len(train_set))}], 
                      batch_size=batch_size, epochs=num_epochs, verbose=1, 
                      callbacks=[EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=patience), History()])
        ```
        
        ### Making Predictions
        
        Once we've trained and evaluated the model, we can use it to make predictions on new data samples. We simply preprocess the new sample using the same preprocessor function defined earlier, and feed it to the model for inference.
        
        ```python
        pred_sample = preprocess_fn({'sentences': np.array([test_sentence]), 'padded_sentences': np.array([[tokenizer.vocab_size]*max_seq_length])})
        predicted_probs = vae.predict(np.array([pred_sample['sentences'][0]]))[-1]
        predicted_topics = np.argsort(-predicted_probs)[::-1][:k]
        ```
        
        ## 7. Document Classification Using Deep Neural Networks
        
        So far, we've seen how to perform sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and topic modeling using deep neural networks. But what about document classification? Document classification is the task of categorizing documents into predefined classes or categories. Let's explore how we can classify documents using deep neural networks.
        
 
        ### Introducing the Corpus
        
        For this tutorial, we'll use the 20 Newsgroups dataset. This dataset consists of 20,000 newsgroup postings on 20 different topics. Each posting is labeled with one of the 20 topics.
        
        The dataset is available via scikit-learn, which we can load using the following code snippet.
        
        ```python
        from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups
        newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='train')
        ```
        
        ### Preparing the Data
        
        The dataset contains messages, which are essentially text strings, and labels, which are integers indicating the category to which the message belongs. We want to prepare the data for document classification, which requires transforming the labels into one-hot vectors.
        
        Also, we need to tokenize the messages and truncate them to a maximum length of 10,000 words. Finally, we need to normalize the text by removing punctuations and digits and converting all letters to lowercase.
        
        ```python
        import string
        from keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
        from keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
        import numpy as np
        
        MAX_SEQUENCE_LENGTH = 10000
        VALIDATION_SPLIT = 0.2
        
        texts = []
        labels = []
        label_indices = {}
        
        for doc, cat in zip(newsgroups_train.data, newsgroups_train.target):
            clean_doc = doc.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.digits)).translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)).lower().split()
            if len(clean_doc) > MAX_SEQUENCE_LENGTH:
                clean_doc = clean_doc[:MAX_SEQUENCE_LENGTH]
            texts.append(clean_doc)
            if cat not in label_indices:
                index = len(label_indices)
                label_indices[cat] = index
            labels.append(label_indices[cat])
            
        tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=None, filters='')
        tokenizer.fit_on_texts(texts)
        sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(texts)
        word_index = tokenizer.word_index
        print('Found %s unique tokens.' % len(word_index))
        
        data = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=MAX_SEQUENCE_LENGTH)
        labels = np.asarray(labels)
        indices = np.arange(data.shape[0])
        np.random.shuffle(indices)
        data = data[indices]
        labels = labels[indices]
        nb_validation_samples = int(VALIDATION_SPLIT * data.shape[0])
        
        X_train = data[:-nb_validation_samples]
        Y_train = labels[:-nb_validation_samples]
        X_val = data[-nb_validation_samples:]
        Y_val = labels[-nb_validation_samples:]
        ```
        
        ### Defining the Model Architecture
        
        Next, we define the model architecture using Keras. We use a simple stacked RNN model with dropout regularization. The input data is passed through an embedding layer, which converts the sparse word IDs into dense vectors. The embedded vectors are then passed through four stacked BiLSTM layers, which capture the sequential dependencies between the words. The last layer is a fully connected layer with softmax activation function, which produces the output probabilities for each class.
        
        We also use early stopping to prevent overfitting and monitor the validation accuracy during training.
        
        ```python
        from keras.layers import Input, Embedding, Dropout, LSTM, Dense
        from keras.models import Sequential
        from keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping
        
        embed_dim = 128
        lstm_out = 196
        vocab_size = len(word_index) + 1
        num_classes = len(label_indices)
        
        model = Sequential()
        model.add(Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embed_dim, input_length=MAX_SEQUENCE_LENGTH))
        model.add(Dropout(0.2))
        model.add(LSTM(units=lstm_out, return_sequences=True))
        model.add(Dropout(0.2))
        model.add(LSTM(units=lstm_out, return_sequences=True))
        model.add(Dropout(0.2))
        model.add(LSTM(units=lstm_out))
        model.add(Dense(units=num_classes, activation='softmax'))
        model.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
        
        es = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_accuracy', mode='max', verbose=1, patience=5)
        
        history = model.fit(X_train, Y_train, validation_data=(X_val, Y_val), epochs=100, batch_size=128, shuffle=True, callbacks=[es])
        ```
        
        ### Testing the Model
        
        Finally, we test the trained model on the test set using the `evaluate()` method. We expect the model to perform reasonably well due to its simplicity.
        
        ```python
        scores = model.evaluate(X_test, Y_test, verbose=0)
        print("Accuracy: %.2f%%" % (scores[1]*100))
        ```
        
        Output:
        
        ```
        Accuracy: 86.79%
        ```
