# 1.简介
  
 
Model compression and quantization are two essential techniques for reducing the size of deep neural networks (DNNs). They both have several benefits in terms of memory usage, computational efficiency, and energy consumption. In this survey paper, we provide a brief overview on model compression and quantization as well as the existing research efforts on them. The main objective is to introduce readers with a general understanding about these two technologies and their applications. 

# 2.Concepts and Terminologies 
Before diving into details, it's crucial to clarify some basic concepts or terminologies involved in DNNs. These include neurons, layers, weights, activation functions, pooling, convolutional layer, fully connected layer, input-output data, loss function, optimization method, regularization technique, mini-batch training, overfitting problem, underfitting problem, generalization error, test error, train error, and forward propagation. Additionally, we need to know what is machine learning and artificial intelligence and how they relate to each other. Here is an example definition list that can be used in later sections: 


| Term | Definition | 
|---|---|
| Neuron | A unit processing data by applying weight(s) to inputs and passing through an activation function to produce outputs.| 
| Layer | A group of neurons organized together based on specific functionality such as feature extraction, classification, or regression. Layers can also contain shared weights among themselves.| 
| Weight | A numerical value assigned to each connection between two neurons during training. It determines how much influence each neuron has on the output generated from another neuron.| 
| Activation Function | Mathematical function applied at the output of a neuron which maps the weighted sum of its inputs to a scalar value within a range.| 
| Pooling | Reduces the spatial dimensionality of the output by aggregating features of adjacent cells in the input volume.| 
| Convolutional Layer | A type of neural network layer that applies filters to an input image to extract features relevant to the task at hand. | 
| Fully Connected Layer | A type of neural network layer that connects every node in one layer to every node in the next layer without any intermediary nodes.| 
| Input-Output Data | Data provided as input to a system and expected output produced by the same.| 
| Loss Function | A measure of the error between predicted values and actual values. Commonly used loss functions include mean squared error (MSE), cross entropy, categorical crossentropy, and huber loss.| 
| Optimization Method | Algorithm used to minimize the cost function during training to adjust the parameters of the model.| 
| Regularization Technique | Techniques used to prevent overfitting by adding penalty term to the cost function during training.| 
| Mini-Batch Training | A subset of the dataset used for training instead of using the entire dataset to reduce computation time and improve convergence rate.| 
| Overfitting Problem | When a model learns patterns in the training set that do not generalize well to new data. This leads to poor performance on unseen data.| 
| Underfitting Problem | When a model fails to learn important patterns in the training set. This results in poorer performance on validation and testing sets.| 
| Generalization Error | The measure of model's ability to accurately predict outcomes when tested on new, previously unseen data.| 
| Train Error | The measure of model's accuracy on the training dataset.| 
| Test Error | The measure of model's accuracy on the testing dataset.| 
| Forward Propagation | The process of computing output predictions from the input samples fed to the model.| 

In addition to these key concepts, there are many more terms that need to be defined, depending on the specific context. For instance, if we want to talk about transfer learning, we will need to define related terms like pre-trained models, domain adaptation, and fine-tuning. Similarly, if we focus on computer vision tasks, we may need to mention things like object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. However, defining all possible terms ahead of time would make the article too complex and lengthy, so it is recommended to use synonyms, alternate words, or acronyms whenever necessary to keep the content accessible.


# 3. Core Algorithms and Operations
Compression refers to reducing the amount of space required to store a model while maintaining similar level of accuracy. There are three core algorithms or operations involved in compressing a DNN: pruning, knowledge distillation, and quantization. We will discuss each algorithm in detail below. 

## Pruning 
Pruning is the most common form of compression, where some of the lower importance weights are removed from the model altogether. One of the simplest ways to achieve this is by ranking the weights in the network according to their magnitude and removing those with the smallest absolute values until a desired sparsity level is achieved. Another way is to add a mask to the weights after training, indicating which ones should remain active and which ones should be removed. The resulting compressed model will still behave exactly the same way as the original but save significant amounts of disk space. Note that pruning can also result in reduced inference speed due to fewer calculations needed per sample. Overall, pruning is useful when trying to shrink the model down to smaller sizes but with limited impact on accuracy. However, it requires careful tuning of hyperparameters to get optimal performance and can lead to overfitting problems when not done correctly.  

## Knowledge Distillation 
Knowledge distillation is a technique to transfer knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model. It involves assigning a larger loss to less confident guesses made by the student model compared to the correct label, encouraging the student model to match the behavior of the teacher model, and minimizing redundancy by combining multiple small students into one single model. By doing this, the student model becomes very close to the teacher model and achieves better accuracy than a simple copy operation. During training, knowledge distillation is usually combined with different types of regularization techniques such as dropout and L2 regularization to ensure the learned representations are meaningful and disentangled. Knowledge distillation can help to further reduce model size at the expense of accuracy reduction.

## Quantization 
Quantization is another type of compression approach commonly used in DNNs. It involves converting the float point numbers stored in the weights and activations of the network into integer representation, typically using either sign-magnitude or binary formats. This reduces the storage requirement, improves the numerical stability of the model, and allows certain hardware optimizations such as tensor cores in modern CPUs. Quantized models often perform slightly worse than their floating point counterparts but gain significant improvements in speed due to optimized implementations. However, quantization is challenging because it requires careful design of the network architecture, calibration of the quantization thresholds, and additional considerations for ensuring model consistency. Also note that quantization can only be performed at the end stage of the training pipeline after the model is already trained. Therefore, it cannot directly affect memory requirements or accuracy. 


# 4. Examples and Code Explanation 
To illustrate each concept mentioned above, let’s take a look at examples of various architectures that employ these techniques.

### Example Architecture #1 - LeNet-5
The first example architecture we will consider is LeNet-5, a classic CNN model used in digit recognition. 

```python
class LeNet_5(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(LeNet_5, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=1, out_channels=6, kernel_size=(5, 5))
        self.pool1 = nn.MaxPool2d((2, 2))
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=6, out_channels=16, kernel_size=(5, 5))
        self.pool2 = nn.MaxPool2d((2, 2))
        self.fc1   = nn.Linear(in_features=16*5*5, out_features=120)
        self.fc2   = nn.Linear(in_features=120,       out_features=84)
        self.fc3   = nn.Linear(in_features=84,        out_features=10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.conv1(x))
        x = self.pool1(x)
        x = F.relu(self.conv2(x))
        x = self.pool2(x)
        x = x.view(-1, 16*5*5)
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x
```
This model consists of five convolutional layers followed by two fully connected layers. All of the layers except the final linear layer use ReLU activation and max pooling to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature map. To prune this model, we could remove the connections corresponding to the least important filters until we reach our target sparsity level. Since this model was designed before quantization became popular, we don't see an obvious benefit in performing quantization here. 

### Example Architecture #2 - MobileNet V2
MobileNet V2 is a recent version of the famous MobileNet architecture that uses inverted residual blocks with bottleneck design to reduce model complexity and improve performance. 

```python
class MobileNetV2(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        self.model = nn.Sequential(*[
            ConvBNReLU(3, c, stride=2) for c in [32] + [96] * 4 + [192, 320]],

            DepthwiseSeparableConv(320, 16, 2),
            InvertedResidualBlock(16,  32, 2, t=1, num_repeat=2),  
            InvertedResidualBlock(32,  64, 2, t=6, num_repeat=2),
            InvertedResidualBlock(64, 128, 2, t=6, num_repeat=3),
            InvertedResidualBlock(128, 160, 1, t=6, num_repeat=3),
            InvertedResidualBlock(160, 320, 2, t=6, num_repeat=1)]
        )

        self.head = nn.Sequential(*[
            nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1),
            Flatten(),
            Linear(320, 1000),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            Dropout(p=0.2, inplace=False),
            Linear(1000, 10)])
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.model(x)
        x = self.head(x)
        return x
    
def ConvBNReLU(inp, oup, stride):
    return nn.Sequential(
        nn.Conv2d(inp, oup, 3, stride, 1, bias=False),
        nn.BatchNorm2d(oup),
        nn.ReLU(inplace=True))

class DepthwiseSeparableConv(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, inp, oup, stride):
        super(DepthwiseSeparableConv, self).__init__()
        self.depthwise = nn.Conv2d(inp, inp, 3, stride, 1, groups=inp, bias=False)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm2d(inp)
        self.pointwise = nn.Conv2d(inp, oup, 1, 1, 0, bias=False)
        self.bn2 = nn.BatchNorm2d(oup)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.depthwise(x)
        x = self.bn1(x)
        x = F.relu(x)
        
        x = self.pointwise(x)
        x = self.bn2(x)
        x = F.relu(x)
        return x
        
class InvertedResidualBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, inp, oup, stride, t, num_repeat):
        super(InvertedResidualBlock, self).__init__()
        self.stride = stride
        self.t = t
        self.num_repeat = num_repeat
        self.identity = False
        
        if stride!= 1 or inp!= oup:
            self.identity = True
            
        layers = []
        for i in range(num_repeat):
            hidden_dim = round(inp * t)
            
            layers.extend([
                DWSepConv(hidden_dim, stride=stride if i == 0 else 1),
                nn.BatchNorm2d(hidden_dim),
                nn.ReLU(inplace=True)])
                
            inp = hidden_dim
                
        self.layers = nn.Sequential(*layers)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        if self.identity:
            identity = x
        out = self.layers(x)
        
        if self.identity:
            out += identity
        return out
    
class DWSepConv(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, inp, oup, stride=1):
        super(DWSepConv, self).__init__()
        assert stride in [1, 2]
 
        self.depthwise = nn.Conv2d(inp, inp, 3, stride, 1, groups=inp, bias=False)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm2d(inp)
        self.pointwise = nn.Conv2d(inp, oup, 1, 1, 0, bias=False)
        self.bn2 = nn.BatchNorm2d(oup)
 
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.depthwise(x)
        x = self.bn1(x)
        x = F.relu(x)
        x = self.pointwise(x)
        x = self.bn2(x)
        x = F.relu(x)
        return x
```
Here we see an implementation of MobileNet V2 with depthwise separable convolutions and inverted residual blocks. The `ConvBNReLU` function creates a sequential block consisting of convolution, batch normalization, and relu activation functions. The `DepthwiseSeparableConv` class defines a depthwise separable convolution module, including two consequent convolutions (`depthwise` and `pointwise`) and respective batch normalizations. The `InvertedResidualBlock` class defines an inverted residual block composed of repeated instances of dwsepconv/bn/relu submodules. Finally, the head section contains adaptive average pooling, flattening, and two fully connected layers with ReLU and dropout activation functions. 

To prune this model, we could replace some of the inverted residual blocks with non-functional modules or simply set their sparsity levels to zero. However, since the goal is to preserve the overall structure of the model, we might try introducing noise into the weights of the remaining layers using techniques such as random dropout or Gaussian blurring. 

One potential issue with this model is that it has relatively high latency compared to other state-of-the-art models. This is likely due to its heavy use of depthwise separable convolutions and low resolution inputs, leading to sparse feature maps and slow computations. Improvements in hardware support and efficient implementations can address this issue, although they may require careful modifications to the architecture itself. Nonetheless, quantization can potentially bring performance gains even with these drawbacks, especially if the platform supports tensor cores or dedicated accelerators for faster matrix multiplications.
