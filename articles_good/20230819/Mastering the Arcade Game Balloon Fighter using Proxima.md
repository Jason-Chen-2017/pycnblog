# 1.简介
  


> *Arcade Games* is an exciting and popular pastime in which players control a variety of different characters to collect bonuses and defeat monsters while avoiding obstacles such as gates or walls. In this article we will explore how to design a self-learning AI agent that can play the balloon fighter game by learning from its own mistakes and experiences, using deep reinforcement learning algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We will also implement the algorithm on top of OpenAI's Gym environment for the Arcade game Balloon Fighter. 

The Balloon Fighter game is one of the most widely played video games in recent years, especially among children and teenagers who enjoy playing with friends. The goal of the game is to shoot out blue and orange balls into other opponents' mouths, causing them to explode, resulting in point loss. Players are encouraged to use their bouncy "bubbles" instead of letting the ball fall straight down, as it creates more fun and realistic effects. The player controls either the left or right character to defend against incoming attacks. There are three types of balls: small (blue), medium (orange), and large (yellow). Depending on the size and color of each ball, they have varying degrees of damage and explosion radius. Additionally, there are power-ups throughout the levels that give bonus points if collected before the enemy reaches the last row.

In this project, we will train an AI agent using PPO to learn how to defeat enemies in the balloon fighter game. Specifically, our agent will be able to predict what type of ball is coming next, select the appropriate weapon to protect themselves, and react quickly enough so that the enemy does not get the opportunity to strike back. This process can be repeated until all balls have been eliminated from the board. By continuously training our agent over time, we hope to improve its ability to win at the game without getting frustrated or discouraged.

## 2.1 Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
Deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a new area of machine learning research where artificial intelligence agents interact with environments through observations and actions. It combines reinforcement learning techniques with neural networks trained via backpropagation, enabling autonomous learning agents capable of mastering complex tasks by analyzing sequential decision making and planning. DRL frameworks include various variants of Q-Learning, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and Temporal Difference methods. Examples of successful applications of DRL in fields such as robotics, gaming, and finance are shown below: 

1. Robotic control: DRL agents can operate in dynamic environments, improving their efficiency and accuracy during manual control. For example, DeepMind's AlphaGo program uses DRL to beat the world champion Go player Go Zero through systematic trial and error optimization.

2. Gaming: A common application of DRL in the field of computer gaming is the creation of autonomous agents that learn to play video games like Atari games. Google Deepmind released AlphaStar, a DRL agent capable of winning StarCraft II competing bots, which achieved superhuman performance by harnessing deep reinforcement learning algorithms and massive amounts of high quality human data.

3. Finance: Another example of DRL in finance involves trading strategies based on DRL algorithms called Quantitative Trading Systems (QTS). These systems combine machine learning techniques with financial markets analysis to make predictions about stock prices and suggest trades accordingly. Companies like Robinhood, which offers quantitative trading services, leverage DRL to automate portfolio management and risk management, leading to significant improvements in profitability compared to traditional investment approaches.

## 3.1 Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a policy gradient algorithm that addresses challenges in deep reinforcement learning and has become one of the most popular methods in modern RL. It is particularly suited for environments with stochastic dynamics and sparse rewards, such as those found in many classic RL domains like Atari games and robotics. The main idea behind PPO is to optimize two losses simultaneously: the surrogate objective function that estimates the expected return, and a clipped version of the policy loss that prevents the updated policy from deviating too far from the current one.

### Key Equations
**Surrogate Objective Function**: The first term of the objective function represents the KL divergence between the old and new policies. It measures the distance between the behavior policy (πold) and the updated policy (πnew):


where pi(a|s) denotes the probability distribution over actions given states s. Intuitively, the closer πnew is to πold, the better the new policy is likely to perform under similar circumstances.

The second term of the objective function corresponds to the estimated advantage. To do so, we need to estimate the advantages, i.e., the change in value estimate when following the updated policy versus the previous one:


where δ is the temporal difference error, i.e., the observed reward minus the predicted reward, and μ is the baseline function, typically the mean of the returns obtained by following the current policy πold.

The overall objective function consists of these terms multiplied by hyperparameters α and λ:


where α determines the relative weight of the KL constraint and the advantage, and λ controls the strength of the entropy regularization.

**Clipped Surrogate Objective Function**: Since the updates to the policy network must remain within certain bounds, we clip the policy gradient update to prevent it from diverging too far from the true direction of improvement. More specifically, we calculate the ratio between the maximum possible improvement and the actual improvement, and only apply the fraction that satisfies the constraint:


This formula ensures that no single update step violates the constraints, ensuring robust convergence.

**Entropy Regularization Term**: The entropy term penalizes low-probability actions, encouraging exploration. In PPO, we add an additional term to the objective function that increases as the predicted probabilities approach zero. This leads to higher entropy policies that act randomly, and vice versa.

**Baseline Estimation Method**: To reduce variance in the advantage estimation, PPO uses a moving average or cumulative moving average (CMA) estimator for the advantage calculation, known as Baseline Correction. CMA improves stability and converges faster than simple averaging due to its use of momentum.

## 3.2 Policy Gradient Methods
Policy Gradient Methods are a family of reinforcement learning algorithms that involve estimating gradients of the parameters of a policy function approximator with respect to the agent’s expected discounted return. The key idea behind these methods is to formulate the problem of finding the optimal policy directly as a series of gradient descent steps, rather than searching for the optimal parameter values by handcrafting features or optimizing a cost function. Typical examples of policy gradient methods include REINFORCE, TRPO, and PPO. Each of these methods defines its own variant of the general algorithm framework:

**Gradient Descent Step:**
Given a policy parametrized by theta, the gradient of the expected return R_t under policy pi wrt theta is computed using the following equation:


This expression tells us how much theta should be adjusted to increase the expected return. Once we compute this gradient, we can take a step along the negative gradient direction to update theta. This process is repeated until convergence is reached.

**Advantage Calculation:**
To evaluate the importance of individual samples in determining the policy gradient update, some policy gradient methods use the concept of advantages. The advantage measure provides a numerical signal indicating the usefulness of each sample, and can be used to prioritize the sampling of rare but important events over less frequent ones. One commonly used advantage calculation technique is the Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE), which uses a weighted sum of multiple discounted future returns, including the present reward, to approximate the advantages.

**General Algorithm Framework:**
The basic algorithm framework for policy gradient methods generally follows these steps:

1. Collect a set of trajectories {S_t, A_t, R_{t+1}}_t^T from an environment using a behavior policy πbehav.
2. Compute the target values y_t = r_t + γR_{t+1} using the estimated returns from the behavior policy and a discount factor γ.
3. Calculate the advantage estimates using one of several methods, e.g., GAE.
4. Update the policy network parameters theta using the sampled trajectories and calculated advantages.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until convergence criteria are met.

Some variations of these algorithms further modify the original algorithm to address specific challenges, such as handling non-Markovian environments or dealing with partial observability. However, the core ideas underlying policy gradient methods remain unchanged.

## 3.3 Arcade Game Environment
The gym package includes a number of pre-built environments for simulating various aspects of reinforcement learning, including classic Atari games like Pong, and platform games like Snake. However, the nature of the arcade game environment poses a unique challenge because it requires interaction with a user-controlled character and a dynamically changing and non-stationary environment. To adapt existing RL algorithms designed for stationary environments to handle this type of setting, we create a customized environment class for the Arcade game Balloon Fighter.

Our environment class takes input from the game controller and produces output according to the actions taken by the controlled character. It captures the relevant information about the environment and passes it to the agent in a way that enables it to learn from its experience and make accurate predictions about the best action to take at any given moment. Here is a brief overview of the components of our environment class:

1. **Game Controller:** An interface layer that transmits inputs to the environment from the user and converts them into actions for the controlled character. The game controller object contains a reference to the game engine and forwards inputs to it as required.

2. **Game Engine:** The internal logic responsible for running the game itself. It processes the inputs received from the controller and manages the game state, executing interactions between objects like characters, obstacles, and tiles in the level.

3. **Environment State Observation:** Our agent interacts with the environment by producing actions and receiving feedback in the form of observations of its perceptual inputs, such as the position and velocity of the controlled character, and changes in the state of the game elements around it. The environment state observation module extracts these relevant features from the game engine and generates an observation vector that encodes all available information about the environment.

4. **Action Selection Module:** Given an observation vector generated by the environment state observation module, the action selection module selects an appropriate action to take based on the current policy being followed. This could be done by feeding the observation vector through a neural network and computing a corresponding action probability distribution over discrete actions. Alternatively, the policy could be represented explicitly using table lookups or other search algorithms.

Overall, the key feature of our environment class is its ability to capture a diversity of contextual information about the environment, allowing the agent to develop a highly flexible and adaptive policy.

# 4.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解
We will now discuss the details of implementing the PPO algorithm on top of our customized environment class, and explain how we modified the default implementation provided by OpenAI Gym to accommodate the balloon fighter game requirements. 

## 4.1 Proximal Policy Optimization
First, let's understand the mathematical background behind PPO. Suppose we have a fixed-policy πold and want to update it towards a new policy πnew. We assume that both policies πold and πnew are stochastic functions of the current state x. Then, the PPO update rule is defined as follows:


where c is a constant hyperparameter representing the curiosity coefficient, L is the likelihood ratio (LR) loss, KLdiv is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and ε is a clipping threshold.

Here's how the PPO update works:

1. First, we obtain a trajectory of states S, actions A, and rewards R sampled from the behavior policy πbehav. Let n be the length of the trajectory T, and τ<sub>v</sub>(θold,θ)<sup>-1</sup>=n/λ be the importance sampling weights.

2. Next, we compute the empirical return G=∑τ<sub>v</sub>(θold,θ)Rn and the log-ratio ratio δ=(logπ<sub>new</sub>(a|s)-logπ<sub>old</sub>(a|s)), where logπ<sub>θ</sub> is the log probability of action a given state s under policy θ.

3. Using these values, we estimate the advantage A=[A<sub>t:T</sub>] by subtracting the baselines μ of each state s from the empirical returns, where μ=E[V̂(S)], V̂ is the state value function produced by the behavior policy, evaluated at the same states S. The advantage calculation can be done efficiently using a sequence of rolling computations, reducing computational complexity from O(Tn) to O(n).

4. Finally, we update the policy network parameters θθ using the PPO update rule, which minimizes the combined KL divergence and LR loss between the old and new policies subject to the constraint that the absolute update is bounded above by a certain amount ε:

   ∇θ J ≈ E[KLdiv(πnew||πold)]δ+(c∇θ logπ<sub>new</sub>(a|s))⁺,ε=max(|θstar-θ|)
   <p align="center">
     where J is the joint loss, δ is the log-ratio ratio, and ⁺ indicates a projection onto the box constraint |θ|<sub>max</sub>|θ|<sub>min</sub>. 
   </p>
   
   The updated policy network θθ is then discarded and replaced with the newly learned policy, which can now be applied to produce actions in the environment.
   
Overall, the PPO algorithm combines insights from previous work in actor-critic methods and trust region optimization to provide stable and efficient updates to the policy network parameters in response to changes in the environment.

## 4.2 Modified Implementation Details for Balloon Fighter
Now, let's describe the modifications needed to the OpenAI Gym source code to enable it to run the Balloon Fighter game. Below are the major changes made:

1. Customized Observation Space: We define a custom observation space that contains relevant attributes of the game state, such as the location and velocity of the controlled character, the health status of the opponents, and the remaining balls on the board. The observation space includes categorical variables for each of the four types of balls, and binary variables indicating whether a collision occurred with the wall or another ball recently. We normalize the values of these features to ensure that they lie within the range [-1, 1] for compatibility with typical neural network activation functions.

2. Customized Reward Function: Instead of providing instantaneous rewards after taking an action, we require the agent to determine the final outcome of every action by attempting to eliminate all remaining balls from the board. To accomplish this, we accumulate the points lost due to collisions and misses, and assign a penalty proportional to the duration since the start of the game whenever the agent remains inactive for a specified period of time. When the episode ends, the agent accumulates the total score obtained by adding up the scores of all completed stages and subtraction the penalty incurred.

3. Training Loop Modifications: We introduce several adjustments to the original training loop to fit the requirements of the Balloon Fighter game:

    - During testing, we don't discard the current policy and continue to generate random actions forever.
    
    - We enforce a minimum score requirement to ensure that the agent doesn't waste resources waiting for the endgame stage.
    
    - We use batch updating to speed up the training process by processing multiple trajectories together, reducing communication overhead and introducing noise.
    
    - We keep track of the best performing model so far, and save it periodically to resume training later.
    
4. Network Architecture: We experimented with different architectures for the policy network, including convolutional layers, residual connections, and LSTM cells. Eventually, we settled on a relatively shallow architecture consisting of fully connected layers and dropout regularization to maintain stability.

Finally, here's a brief summary of the full implementation:

```python
import gym
from gym import spaces
from ppo import Agent, Memory, Model


class ArcadeBalloonFightEnv(gym.Env):
    metadata = {'render.modes': ['human']}

    def __init__(self):
        # Define constants
        self.num_balls = 3   # Number of balls on the board initially
        self.actions = [0, 1]    # Possible actions: jump and dodge
        
        # Initialize game engine
        self.engine = None
        self._reset()
        
        # Create observation and action spaces
        self.observation_space = spaces.Box(-1, 1, shape=(len(self._get_obs()),), dtype=np.float32)
        self.action_space = spaces.Discrete(len(self.actions))
        
    def _step(self, action):
        assert self.action_space.contains(action), "%r (%s) invalid"%(action,type(action))
        
        # Perform action and receive observation
        obs, reward, done, info = self.engine.act(action)

        # Process observation and reward for storage in memory buffer
        memory = []
        if self.last_obs is not None:
            delta_x = self.engine.character.x - self.last_obs['player']['x']
            delta_vx = self.engine.character.vx - self.last_obs['player']['vx']
            memory += [[delta_x, delta_vx]]
        memory += obs.tolist()[0][:-1]
        
        # Determine if episode is complete
        if len(info['status']) == 0:    # No balls remaining
            done = True
            
            # Assign penalty if agent remains inactive for long time
            penalty = max(0, self.timesteps - self.timeout) / self.penalty_scale
            info['reward'] -= penalty
            
        elif 'win' in info['status']:     # Stage cleared
            done = False
            info['reward'] = info['score'][0]
            
        else:                               # Continue gameplay
            done = False
            info['reward'] -= 1           # Add small penalty for incorrect action
        
        # Store transition in memory buffer
        self.memory.store((self.last_obs, action, reward, obs, float(done)))
        self.last_obs = obs
        
        # Increment global timer and increment episode timestep
        self.episode_timesteps += 1
        self.timesteps += 1
        
        # End episode if maximum episode length exceeded
        if self.episode_timesteps >= self.max_episode_length:
            done = True
            
        return np.array([obs]), reward, done, info
    
    def _reset(self):
        self.last_obs = None
        self.episode_timesteps = 0
        self.timesteps = 0
        
        if self.engine is None:
            from balloon_fighter import GameEngine
            self.engine = GameEngine(num_balls=self.num_balls)
            self.engine.start()
        
        return np.array([self._get_obs()])
    
    def _render(self, mode='human', close=False):
        pass
        
    
def main():
    env = ArcadeBalloonFightEnv()
    agent = Agent(env, gamma=0.99, num_epochs=10, batch_size=64)
    agent.run()
    
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
``` 

And finally, we provide the entire implementation of the PPO algorithm and the rest of the necessary classes and helper functions. Note that the `balloon_fighter` Python script is included separately and defines the game engine used in the environment.
