## 1. Background Introduction

Computer vision (CV) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling machines to interpret and understand the visual world. It involves developing algorithms and models that can analyze images and videos, extract meaningful information, and make decisions based on that information. This technology has numerous applications, including autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, medical imaging, and robotics.

### 1.1 Importance of Computer Vision

Computer vision plays a crucial role in the development of AI systems that can interact with the physical world. By enabling machines to understand and interpret visual data, we can create intelligent systems that can perform tasks autonomously, improve safety, and increase efficiency.

### 1.2 Brief History of Computer Vision

The history of computer vision can be traced back to the 1960s, when researchers began exploring ways to enable machines to recognize patterns in images. Early work focused on simple tasks, such as edge detection and object recognition. Over the years, advancements in computer hardware, software, and machine learning algorithms have led to significant improvements in computer vision capabilities.

## 2. Core Concepts and Connections

To understand computer vision, it is essential to grasp several core concepts and their interconnections.

### 2.1 Image Acquisition

Image acquisition refers to the process of capturing images using cameras or other imaging devices. This process involves converting light into electrical signals, which are then processed to create an image.

### 2.2 Image Preprocessing

Image preprocessing is the process of enhancing the quality of images to make them more suitable for analysis. This may involve tasks such as noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and normalization.

## 4. Detailed Explanation and Examples of Mathematical Models and Formulas

### 4.1 Sobel Edge Detection

The Sobel edge detection algorithm uses gradient operators to calculate the intensity differences between pixels in an image. The Sobel operators are as follows:

$$
G_x =
\\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 0 & 1 \\\\
-2 & 0 & 2 \\\\
-1 & 0 & 1
\\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
G_y =
\\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & -2 & -1 \\\\
0 & 0 & 0 \\\\
1 & 2 & 1
\\end{bmatrix}
$$

The gradient magnitude and direction are then calculated as follows:

$$
magnitude = \\sqrt{G_x^2 + G_y^2}
$$

$$
direction = \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{G_y}{G_x} \\right)
$$

### 4.2 Canny Edge Detection

The Canny edge detection algorithm is a more robust version of the Sobel algorithm that includes noise reduction and non-maximum suppression steps. The algorithm can be summarized as follows:

1. Gaussian smoothing: Apply a Gaussian filter to reduce noise.
2. Gradient calculation: Calculate the gradient magnitude and direction using the Sobel operators.
3. Non-maximum suppression: Suppress responses that are not the local maximum in the gradient direction.
4. Double thresholding: Apply two threshold values to classify edges as strong or weak.
5. Edge tracking by hysteresis: Follow strong edges and suppress weak edges that are not connected to strong edges.

# Set the input image size
width, height = 416, 416

# Load the input image
img = cv2.imread('image.jpg')
img = cv2.resize(img, (width, height))

# Preprocess the input image
img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
img = np.expand_dims(img, axis=0)
img = np.transpose(img, (0, 3, 1, 2))
img = np.divide(img, 255.0)

# Run the YOLOv3 model
detections = darknet.detect(net, meta, img, thresh=0.5)

# Display the original and detected images
for i, detection in enumerate(detections):
    x1, y1, x2, y2 = detection[0], detection[1], detection[2], detection[3]
    class_id = detection[4]
    confidence = detection[5]

    if confidence > 0.5:
        label = meta.classes[class_id - 1]
        color = (0, 255, 0)
        cv2.rectangle(img, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), color, 2)
        cv2.putText(img, label, (x1, y1 - 10), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.5, color, 2)
