### Mathematical Models and Formulas

In the following sections, we will delve into the mathematical models and formulas used in the three key areas of e-commerce operations: smart recommendations, personalized marketing, and inventory management optimization.

#### Smart Recommendations

**Collaborative Filtering Model:**

$$
R_{ij} = \frac{\sum_{k \in N_j} r_{ik}}{\sum_{k \in N_j} w_{ik}}
$$

where $R_{ij}$ is the predicted rating for item $i$ by user $j$, $N_j$ is the set of neighbors of user $j$, $r_{ik}$ is the actual rating of item $i$ by user $k$, and $w_{ik}$ is the weight assigned to neighbor $k$.

**Content-Based Filtering Model:**

$$
sim(i, u) = \frac{\sum_{a \in A_i \cap A_u} w_a^2}{\sqrt{\sum_{a \in A_i} w_a^2} \cdot \sqrt{\sum_{a \in A_u} w_a^2}}
$$

where $sim(i, u)$ is the similarity between item $i$ and user $u$, $A_i$ and $A_u$ are the sets of attributes associated with item $i$ and user $u$, and $w_a$ is the weight assigned to attribute $a$.

#### Personalized Marketing

**Customer Segmentation Model:**

$$
C_j = \sum_{i=1}^k w_i \cdot c_{ij}
$$

where $C_j$ is the customer segment to which user $j$ belongs, $k$ is the number of segments, $w_i$ is the weight of segment $i$, and $c_{ij}$ is the customer characteristic value for user $j$ in segment $i$.

**Customer Behavior Prediction Model:**

$$
p(y=1|X) = \sigma(\beta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n \beta_i x_i)
$$

where $p(y=1|X)$ is the probability of a customer making a purchase given their feature vector $X$, $\sigma$ is the logistic function, $\beta_0$ is the intercept, and $\beta_i$ are the coefficients for each feature $x_i$.

#### Inventory Management Optimization

**Demand Forecasting Model:**

$$
\hat{D_t} = \alpha \cdot D_{t-1} + (1-\alpha) \cdot D_t'
$$

where $\hat{D_t}$ is the forecasted demand for time period $t$, $D_{t-1}$ is the actual demand for the previous time period, $D_t'$ is the forecasted demand for the current time period, and $\alpha$ is the smoothing coefficient.

**Inventory Replenishment Plan Model:**

$$
\min Z = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^m c_{ij} \cdot x_{ij}
$$

subject to

$$
\sum_{j=1}^m x_{ij} \geq D_t \\
x_{ij} \geq 0
$$

where $Z$ is the total cost of inventory replenishment, $c_{ij}$ is the cost of replenishing item $i$ at warehouse $j$, $x_{ij}$ is the quantity of item $i$ replenished at warehouse $j$, and $D_t$ is the forecasted demand for time period $t$.

### Project Practice: Code Examples and Detailed Explanations

In this section, we provide practical examples of how AI technologies are implemented in e-commerce platforms to enhance operational efficiency. We will focus on smart recommendations and inventory management optimization.

#### Smart Recommendations: Content-Based Filtering Example

**Code Example:**

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Sample data
items = ['Laptop', 'Smartphone', 'Headphones', 'Monitor', 'Keyboard']
descriptions = [
    'High-performance laptop with a 15.6-inch display',
    '5G-enabled smartphone with a 6.7-inch AMOLED screen',
    'Noise-cancelling headphones with a wireless design',
    'Full HD monitor with a 144Hz refresh rate',
    'Wireless mechanical keyboard with RGB lighting'
]

# Convert descriptions to TF-IDF vectors
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(descriptions)

# Calculate similarity between items
similarity_matrix = tfidf_matrix @ tfidf_matrix.T

# Sample user preferences
user_preferences = [
    'I need a high-performance laptop with a 15.6-inch display',
    'I want a 5G-enabled smartphone with a 6.7-inch AMOLED screen',
    'I love noise-cancelling headphones with a wireless design',
    'I need a Full HD monitor with a 144Hz refresh rate',
    'I want a wireless mechanical keyboard with RGB lighting'
]

# Convert user preferences to TF-IDF vectors
user_preferences_vector = vectorizer.transform(user_preferences)

# Calculate similarity between user preferences and items
user_similarity_matrix = user_preferences_vector @ tfidf_matrix.T

# Find top 3 recommended items
recommended_indices = user_similarity_matrix.argsort()[-3:][::-1]
recommended_items = [items[i] for i in recommended_indices]
print(recommended_items)
```

**Explanation:**

The code above demonstrates how to implement a content-based filtering algorithm using TF-IDF vectors. First, we convert the item descriptions and user preferences into TF-IDF vectors using the `TfidfVectorizer` class from the `sklearn` library. Then, we calculate the similarity between the user preferences and item descriptions using the dot product. Finally, we find the top 3 recommended items by selecting the items with the highest similarity scores.

#### Inventory Management Optimization: Demand Forecasting Example

**Code Example:**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Sample historical sales data
sales_data = np.array([
    [0, 50],
    [1, 55],
    [2, 60],
    [3, 58],
    [4, 65],
    [5, 70],
    [6, 68],
    [7, 72],
    [8, 75],
    [9, 78],
    [10, 80]
])

# Split data into time periods and sales values
time_periods = sales_data[:, 0]
sales_values = sales_data[:, 1]

# Train a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(time_periods.reshape(-1, 1), sales_values)

# Make a forecast for the next time period
next_time_period = 11
predicted_sales = model.predict([[next_time_period]])

# Print the forecasted sales value
print(predicted_sales)
```

**Explanation:**

The code above demonstrates how to implement a simple linear regression model for demand forecasting. We first split the historical sales data into time periods and sales values. Then, we train a linear regression model using the `LinearRegression` class from the `sklearn` library. Finally, we make a forecast for the next time period by predicting the sales value for the next time period using the trained model. The predicted sales value is then printed to the console.
