$$

where $f(x)$ represents the objective function, and $x$ represents the variable.

**4.4 Path Navigation Model**

Path navigation is the final component of a smart parking system. Here is a commonly used path navigation model:

$$

Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm used for calculating the shortest path. Here is a formula for Dijkstra's algorithm:

$$
Distance[i] = \min_{j \in neighbors[i]} (Distance[j] + Cost[j, i])
$$

where $Distance[i]$ represents the shortest distance from the starting point to node $i$, and $Cost[j, i]$ represents the distance from node $j$ to node $i$.

class SensorDataCollector:
    def __init__(self, url):
        self.url = url

    def collect_data(self):
        response = requests.get(self.url)

**5.3 Code Analysis**

The following is a detailed explanation and analysis of the code:

**5.3.1 Sensor Data Collection**

The `SensorDataCollector` class is responsible for obtaining data from the sensor API. It uses the `requests` library to send an HTTP GET request and parse the returned JSON data.

**5.3.2 Data Processing**

The `DataProcessor` class is responsible for preprocessing sensor data. It retrieves raw data by calling the `collect_data` method and then cleans and denoises it using the `pandas` library.

**5.3.3 Parking Space Prediction**

The `ParkingSpacePredictor` class is responsible for training the prediction model. It first calls the `preprocess_data` method to obtain preprocessed data, then trains a `RandomForestRegressor` model from the `scikit-learn` library.

**5.3.4 Dynamic Allocation**

The `ParkingSpaceAllocator` class is responsible for dynamic allocation of parking spaces. It calls the `predict` method to obtain the prediction result and allocates parking spaces based on the prediction result.

**5.3.5 Path Navigation**

The `PathNavigator` class is responsible for path navigation. Here, the navigation logic needs to be implemented, such as using the A* algorithm to calculate the shortest path from the starting point to the endpoint.

**5.4 Running Results Display**

Assuming we have a JSON file `sensor_data.json` containing sensor data, here's an example of how to run the code:

```shell
# Run data preprocessing
python parking/processing.py

# Run prediction model
python parking/prediction.py

# Run dynamic allocation
python parking/allocation.py

# Run path navigation
python parking/navigation.py
```

The running results will display the predicted number of parking spaces, dynamic allocation results, and path navigation information.
