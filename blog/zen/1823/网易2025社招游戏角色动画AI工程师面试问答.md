#### 5.2 Detailed Explanation and Examples

**5.2.1 Cartesian Coordinate System**

The Cartesian coordinate system is the most common type of coordinate system used in game character animation. It uses three axes (x, y, and z) to define positions in 3D space.

**Example 1: Translation**

Suppose a character moves 5 units along the x-axis and 3 units along the y-axis. The translation vector \( T \) is:

$$
T = [5, 3, 0]
$$

**Example 2: Rotation**

Suppose the character rotates 90 degrees around the z-axis. The rotation matrix \( R \) is:

$$
R = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(90^\circ) & -\sin(90^\circ) \\
\sin(90^\circ) & \cos(90^\circ)
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & -1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

**5.2.2 Polar Coordinate System**

The polar coordinate system is useful for describing movements in circular paths.

**Example 1: Translation**

Suppose a character moves 5 units along the radius and 60 degrees around the angle. The translation vector \( T_p \) is:

\frac{1}{2} & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

**5.2.3 Spherical Coordinate System**

The spherical coordinate system is useful for describing movements in 3D space while considering the distance from the origin, as well as the angles around the axes.

**Example 1: Translation**

Suppose a character moves 5 units along the radius, 30 degrees around the azimuthal angle, and 45 degrees around the polar angle. The translation vector \( T_s \) is:

$$
T_s = [5\cos(30^\circ)\cos(45^\circ), 5\sin(30^\circ)\cos(45^\circ), 5\sin(45^\circ)] \approx [3.55, 1.78, 3.55]
$$

**Example 2: Rotation**

Suppose the character rotates 90 degrees around the x-axis, 180 degrees around the y-axis, and 0 degrees around the z-axis. The rotation matrix \( R_s \) is:

$$
R_s = \begin{bmatrix}
\sin(90^\circ)\cos(180^\circ) & -\cos(90^\circ)\cos(180^\circ) & \sin(180^\circ) \\
\sin(90^\circ)\sin(180^\circ) & -\cos(90^\circ)\sin(180^\circ) & \cos(180^\circ) \\
\cos(90^\circ) & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & -1 \\
0 & -1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

def collect_data(video_path, output_path):
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
    frame_id = 0
    
    while cap.isOpened():
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break
        
        frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
        keypoints = openpose酯松/frame
        
        normalized_keypoints = normalize(keypoints)
        augmented_keypoints = augment(normalized_keypoints)
        
        np.save(f"{output_path}/frame_{frame_id}.npy", augmented_keypoints)
        frame_id += 1
    
    cap.release()

collect_data("input_video.mp4", "output_data")
```

**6.4.2 Model Design and Training**

The `model.py` module defines a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) for training. The network takes the preprocessed keypoint data as input and outputs the predicted keypoint positions. Here's an example of the model architecture:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class KeypointPredictionCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(KeypointPredictionCNN, self).__init__()
        
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 16, 3, padding=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, 3, padding=1)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(32 * 8 * 8, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 25) # 25 keypoint coordinates
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.conv1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.conv2(x))
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        
        return x

model = KeypointPredictionCNN()
```

**6.4.3 Model Evaluation and Optimization**

The `evaluation.py` module evaluates the trained model's performance using a validation dataset. It provides metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). Here's an example of the evaluation process:

```python
import torch

def evaluate(model, data_loader, device):
    model.eval()
    total_loss = 0
    
    with torch.no_grad():
        for data in data_loader:
            inputs, targets = data
            inputs, targets = inputs.to(device), targets.to(device)
            
            outputs = model(inputs)
            loss = nn.MSELoss()(outputs, targets)
            
            total_loss += loss.item()
    
    return total_loss / len(data_loader)

total_loss = evaluate(model, validation_loader, device)
print(f"Validation Loss: {total_loss}")
```

**6.4.4 Model Deployment**

The `deployment.py` module deploys the trained model into the Unity game engine. The model is loaded from the saved checkpoint, and the game engine calls the model's prediction function to generate real-time animations. Here's an example of the deployment process:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class AnimationGenerator : MonoBehaviour
{
    private TensorFlowLite.Interpreter interpreter;
    private float[] input_data;
    private float[] output_data;

    void Start()
    {
        string model_path = "path/to/saved/model.tflite";
        interpreter = new TensorFlowLite.Interpreter(model_path);
        input_data = new float[25]; // 25 keypoint coordinates
        output_data = new float[25];
    }

    void Update()
    {
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space))
        {
            // Get keypoint data from the game engine
            GetKeyPointData(input_data);

            // Make a prediction using the trained model
            interpreter.Run(input_data, output_data);

            // Update the character's keypoint positions
            UpdateCharacterKeyPoints(output_data);
        }
    }
}
```

These code examples provide a comprehensive overview of the project's development process, from data collection and preprocessing to model design, training, evaluation, and deployment.
