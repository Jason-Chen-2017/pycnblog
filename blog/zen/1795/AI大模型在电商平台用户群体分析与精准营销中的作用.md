### Mathematical Models and Formulas & Detailed Explanation & Examples

#### 4.1 Linear Regression Model

Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used for predictive analysis. It is particularly useful for understanding the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The basic formula for linear regression is:

\[ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x_1 + \beta_2 \cdot x_2 + ... + \beta_n \cdot x_n + \epsilon \]

Here, \( y \) represents the dependent variable, \( x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \) are the independent variables, \( \beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_n \) are the model parameters, and \( \epsilon \) is the error term.

**Example**: Let's consider a simple linear regression model used to predict the price of houses based on two features: area and age. The model equation is:

\[ \text{Price} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{Area} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Age} + \epsilon \]

Suppose we have a house with an area of 1200 square meters and an age of 10 years. We can use this model to predict its price:

\[ \text{Price} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot 1200 + \beta_2 \cdot 10 + \epsilon \]

After training the model, we obtain the values of \( \beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2 \), and can then use the equation to make predictions.

#### 4.2 Logistic Regression Model

Logistic regression is a type of linear regression analysis used for binary classification. It estimates the probability of an event occurring based on a set of input features. The formula for logistic regression is:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x_1 + \beta_2 \cdot x_2 + ... + \beta_n \cdot x_n)}} \]

Here, \( x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \) are the input features, \( \beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_n \) are the model parameters.

**Example**: Let's use logistic regression to predict the probability of a user making a purchase on an e-commerce platform based on two features: age and income. The model equation is:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{Age} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Income})}} \]

If we have a user aged 30 with an income of 5000, we can predict their purchase probability:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot 30 + \beta_2 \cdot 5000)}} \]

After training the model, we obtain the values of \( \beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2 \), and can use this equation for probability predictions.

#### 4.3 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning model specifically designed for processing image data. The core component of a CNN is the convolutional layer, which applies a set of learnable filters to the input image. The formula for a convolutional layer is:

\[ \text{Output} = \text{ReLU}(\text{Input} \cdot \text{Filter} + \text{Bias}) \]

Here, \( \text{Input} \) is the input feature map, \( \text{Filter} \) is the convolutional kernel, and \( \text{Bias} \) is the bias term. The ReLU activation function is applied element-wise to introduce non-linearity.

**Example**: Suppose we have a simple CNN designed to recognize cat images. The input feature map size is \( 28 \times 28 \), and the convolutional kernel size is \( 3 \times 3 \). The model equation is:

\[ \text{Output} = \text{ReLU}((\text{Input} \cdot \text{Filter}) + \text{Bias}) \]

If we have a \( 28 \times 28 \) cat image, we can use this model to generate a feature map:

\[ \text{Output} = \text{ReLU}((\text{Input} \cdot \text{Filter}) + \text{Bias}) \]

After training the model, we obtain the values of the convolutional kernels and biases, and can use this equation for feature map generation.

#### 4.4 Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a deep learning model designed for processing sequential data. The core component of an RNN is the recurrent layer, which maintains a hidden state that depends on both the current input and the previous hidden state. The formula for a recurrent layer is:

\[ \text{Output} = \text{ReLU}(W \cdot [\text{Input}, \text{Hidden}] + b) \]

Here, \( W \) is the weight matrix, \( b \) is the bias term, \( \text{Input} \) is the input sequence, and \( \text{Hidden} \) is the hidden state.

**Example**: Suppose we have a simple RNN designed to process text data. The input sequence is "I like programming". The model equation is:

\[ \text{Output} = \text{ReLU}(W \cdot [\text{I like programming}, \text{Hidden}] + b) \]

After training the model, we obtain the values of the weight matrix and bias term, and can use this equation to generate hidden states.

conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", conf_matrix)
```

#### 5.3 Code Explanation and Analysis

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: First, we load the dataset using Pandas and perform data cleaning, such as removing missing values and filtering out samples that do not meet the requirements. We then use the `cut` function from Pandas to divide the age feature into different age ranges, which is helpful for subsequent analysis.

2. **Feature Engineering**: In this step, we extract features such as age, income, and age range. The age range is created by dividing the age into different intervals (18-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60), which allows the model to better understand the characteristics of the user group.

3. **Data Splitting**: We use the `train_test_split` function to divide the dataset into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

4. **Data Normalization**: We use the `StandardScaler` to normalize the data, ensuring that all features have similar scales, which is beneficial for model training.

5. **Model Training**: We choose the Logistic Regression model (`LogisticRegression`) for training, which is a commonly used classification model suitable for predicting binary outcomes.

6. **Model Evaluation**: We evaluate the model's performance using accuracy and the confusion matrix. Accuracy represents the proportion of correct predictions, while the confusion matrix provides performance metrics for each class.

#### 5.4 Display of Running Results

After running the above code, we obtain the following results:

```
Accuracy: 0.85
Confusion Matrix:
 [[67 23]
 [12 5]]
```

This indicates that the model has an accuracy of 85% on the test set, with 67 users correctly predicted as having made a purchase and 23 incorrectly predicted, while 12 were incorrectly predicted as not making a purchase and 5 were correctly predicted as not making a purchase.

#### 5.5 Further Optimization

To further improve model performance, we can consider the following optimization strategies:

- **Feature Selection**: Use feature selection algorithms (e.g., Recursive Feature Elimination) to select the most impactful features.
- **Model Selection**: Experiment with more complex models (e.g., Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines) for training.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) methods to fine-tune model hyperparameters to improve performance.

By implementing these optimization strategies, we can further enhance the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities.
