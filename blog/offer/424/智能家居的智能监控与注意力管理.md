## Algorithm Programming Questions

### 1. Motion Detection

**Question:** Implement a simple motion detection algorithm using image processing techniques.

**Answer:**

A simple motion detection algorithm using image processing techniques can be implemented using the OpenCV library in Python. Here's a basic example:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Read the input image
frame = cv2.imread("input_image.jpg")

# Convert the image to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise
blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (5, 5), 0)

# Compute the background image using k-means clustering
background = cv2.kmeans(blurred, 2, None, (1.0, 0.01), 10)[1]

# Create a mask by subtracting the background from the blurred image
mask = blurred - background

# Apply thresholding to obtain a binary image
thresh = cv2.threshold(mask, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV)[1]

# Find contours in the binary image
contours, _ = cv2.findContours(thresh, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

# Draw the contours on the original image
cv2.drawContours(frame, contours, -1, (0, 255, 0), 2)

# Display the result
cv2.imshow("Motion Detection", frame)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### 2. Energy Consumption Prediction

**Question:** Implement a machine learning model to predict energy consumption in a smart home based on historical data.

**Answer:**

A machine learning model for energy consumption prediction can be implemented using scikit-learn in Python. Here's a basic example using linear regression:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv("energy_data.csv")

# Prepare the features and target variable
X = data.drop("energy_consumption", axis=1)
y = data["energy_consumption"]

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)

# Use the model to predict energy consumption for a new input
new_data = np.array([[...]])  # Replace with new input data
predicted_energy = model.predict(new_data)
print("Predicted Energy Consumption:", predicted_energy)
```

### 3. Activity Recognition

**Question:** Implement an activity recognition algorithm using wearable sensors.

**Answer:**

An activity recognition algorithm using wearable sensors can be implemented using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier in Python. Here's a basic example:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv("wearable_data.csv")

# Prepare the features and target variable
X = data.drop("activity", axis=1)
y = data["activity"]

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the KNN classifier
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)

# Use the model to predict the activity for a new input
new_data = np.array([[...]])  # Replace with new input data
predicted_activity = knn.predict(new_data)
