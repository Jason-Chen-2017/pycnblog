**Answer:**
To ensure AI respects personal autonomy, we can implement several ethical guidelines and techniques:

1. **Transparent Algorithms:** Make AI systems' decision-making processes transparent to users so they can understand how their data is being used and how decisions are made.
2. **Data Privacy:** Implement strong data privacy measures to protect user information and ensure that data is used only for its intended purpose.
3. **User Consent:** Always seek user consent before collecting and processing their data, and provide clear options for users to control their data.
4. ** Accountability:** Assign accountability to AI developers and operators to ensure they are held responsible for any violations of personal autonomy.

**Example:**
```go
// Go code to request user consent
func requestConsent() bool {
    response := confirm("Do you consent to share your data for personalization? (yes/no)")
    if response == "yes" {
        return true
    }
    return false
}
```

### 2. Decentralized AI: How to implement a decentralized AI system?

**Question:**
Can you explain how to design a decentralized AI system that avoids centralization of power and data?

**Answer:**
A decentralized AI system can be implemented using several approaches:

1. **Blockchain:** Utilize blockchain technology to decentralize data storage and processing, ensuring that no single entity has control over the entire system.
