### 1. 如何使用机器学习模型预测商品价格？

**Question:** How can machine learning models be used to predict product prices?

**Answer:** Product price prediction can be achieved by training a regression model on historical sales data. The model can take into account various factors like demand, seasonality, competitor pricing, and product attributes.

**Example:**

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

# Preprocess the data (e.g., scaling, encoding categorical variables)
# ...

# Split the data into features and target
X = data.drop('price', axis=1)
y = data['price']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
```

**Explanation:** This example demonstrates the basic steps for training a Random Forest Regressor to predict product prices. The dataset should be preprocessed to handle any missing values, scale features, and encode categorical variables.

### 2. 如何处理缺失值和数据异常？

**Question:** How can missing values and data anomalies be handled in a pricing system?

**Answer:** Handling missing values and anomalies is crucial to ensure the quality of the pricing model. Common techniques include:

- **Imputation:** Replacing missing values with the mean, median, or mode.

- **Transformation:** Using algorithms that can handle missing values, like k-Nearest Neighbors or MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations).
- **Anomaly detection:** Using techniques like Z-score or IQR to identify and handle outliers.

**Example:**

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np

# Example dataset with missing values
data = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, np.nan, 6], [7, 8, np.nan]])

# Impute missing values with the mean
mean = np.nanmean(data)

    elif demand < inventory / 2:
        return current_price * 0.9  # Decrease price by 10% if demand is low
    else:
        return current_price  # Maintain current price if demand is moderate

# Example usage
current_price = 100
demand = 150
inventory = 200
