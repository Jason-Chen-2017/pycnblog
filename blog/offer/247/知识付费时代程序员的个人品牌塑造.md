### Blog Post Title: Building a Personal Brand for Programmers in the Age of Knowledge付费 - Interview Questions and Algorithmic Challenges

#### Introduction

In the era of knowledge付费，programmers need to establish a strong personal brand to stand out in the competitive job market. This blog post will discuss some common interview questions and algorithmic challenges that are frequently asked by top tech companies in China. By understanding these questions and their solutions, you can enhance your problem-solving skills and build a solid foundation for your personal brand.

#### 1. Data Structure and Algorithm Questions

**Question 1: Implement a function to find the median of a linked list.**

**Answer:**

To find the median of a linked list, we can first find the length of the list and then find the middle node.

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def findMedian(head: ListNode) -> float:
    if not head:
        return 0

    fast = slow = head
    prev_slow = None
    while fast and fast.next:
        fast = fast.next.next
        prev_slow = slow
        slow = slow.next

    if prev_slow:
        return prev_slow.val
    return slow.val / 2.0
```

**Explanation:**

We use the fast and slow pointer technique to find the middle node of the linked list. If the length of the list is odd, the median is the value of the middle node. If the length is even, the median is the average of the two middle nodes.

#### 2. Tree Traversal

**Question 2: Given a binary tree, implement in-order traversal without recursion or stack.**

**Answer:**

We can use Morris traversal to traverse the binary tree without recursion or stack.

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def inorderTraversal(root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    while root:
        if root.left is None:
            result.append(root.val)
            root = root.right
        else:
            prev = root.left
            while prev.right and prev.right != root:
                prev = prev.right
            if prev.right is None:
                result.append(root.val)
                prev.right = root
                root = root.left
            else:
                prev.right = None
                root = root.right
    return result
```

**Explanation:**

In Morris traversal, we modify the right pointer of the left subtree to point back to the previous node. This allows us to go back to the previous node without using recursion or a stack.

#### 3. Dynamic Programming

**Question 3: Given a string, implement an algorithm to find the longest common substring with another string.**

**Answer:**

We can use dynamic programming to find the longest common substring.

```python
def longestCommonSubstring(str1, str2):
    m, n = len(str1), len(str2)
    dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]
    max_len = 0
    for i in range(1, m+1):
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            if str1[i-1] == str2[j-1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
                max_len = max(max_len, dp[i][j])
    return max_len
```

**Explanation:**

We use a 2D array `dp` to store the length of the longest common substring ending at `str1[i-1]` and `str2[j-1]`. The maximum length of the longest common substring is updated in each iteration.

#### 4. Graph Theory

**Question 4: Given a directed graph, implement an algorithm to find the topological sorting.**

**Answer:**

We can use DFS to find the topological sorting of a directed graph.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def topologicalSort(graph):
    result = []
    visited = set()

    def dfs(node):
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(neighbor)
        result.append(node)

    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            dfs(node)
    return result[::-1]
```

**Explanation:**

We perform a depth-first search (DFS) on each unvisited node in the graph. During the DFS, we add the node to the `result` list. Finally, we reverse the `result` list to get the topological sorting.

#### 5. Bit Manipulation

**Question 5: Given a number, implement an algorithm to find the next permutation.**

**Answer:**

We can use bit manipulation to find the next permutation.

```python
def nextPermutation(nums):
    i = len(nums) - 2
    while i >= 0 and nums[i] >= nums[i+1]:
        i -= 1
    if i == -1:
        return
    j = len(nums) - 1
    while nums[j] <= nums[i]:
        j -= 1
    nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
    nums[i+1:] = reversed(nums[i+1:])
```

**Explanation:**

To find the next permutation, we first find the largest index `i` such that `nums[i] < nums[i+1]`. Then, we find the largest index `j` such that `nums[j] > nums[i]`. We swap `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`, and finally reverse the subarray from `nums[i+1]` to the end.

#### Conclusion

Building a strong personal brand as a programmer requires not only technical skills but also the ability to solve complex problems efficiently. By understanding and practicing these interview questions and algorithmic challenges, you can enhance your problem-solving skills and position yourself as a top talent in the knowledge付费 era. Remember to apply these concepts to real-world scenarios and continually improve your skills to stay ahead in the competitive job market.
