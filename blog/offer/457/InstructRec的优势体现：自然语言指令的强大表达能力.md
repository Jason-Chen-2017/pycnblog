I will provide a blog post with a list of representative interview questions and algorithmic problem sets from top Chinese tech giants, along with in-depth answer explanations and source code examples. Here we go!

### Introduction

InstructRec, a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) model, excels in understanding and generating natural language instructions. This blog post will explore the advantages of InstructRec by presenting a collection of interview questions and algorithmic problems that highlight its exceptional ability to express complex instructions. We will delve into various areas of computer science and engineering, including machine learning, data structures, algorithms, and system design.

### Interview Questions and Problem Sets

#### 1. How to build a recommendation system for natural language instructions?

**Question:**
Design a recommendation system that can suggest relevant instructions based on user input.

**Answer:**
A recommendation system for natural language instructions can be built using machine learning techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid methods. Here is a high-level overview of a content-based filtering approach:

1. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Use embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT) to convert user input and candidate instructions into high-dimensional vectors.
   - Extract additional features like keywords, entities, and semantic roles.

2. **Similarity Computation:**
   - Compute the similarity between the user input vector and each candidate instruction vector using distance metrics like cosine similarity.
   - Rank the candidate instructions based on their similarity scores.

3. **Recommendation Generation:**
   - Select the top-k highest-ranked instructions as recommendations for the user.

**Source Code Example:**
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# User input
user_input_embedding = ...  # Pre-trained embedding vector for user input

# Candidate instructions embeddings
candidate_embeddings = [...]  # Pre-trained embedding vectors for candidate instructions

# Compute similarity scores
similarity_scores = cosine_similarity(user_input_embedding, candidate_embeddings)

# Generate recommendations
top_k_indices = np.argsort(similarity_scores)[0][-k:]
top_k_recommendations = [candidate_embeddings[i] for i in top_k_indices]
```

#### 2. How to handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in natural language instructions?

**Question:**
Explain how to deal with OOV words in natural language instructions during training and inference.

**Answer:**
Handling OOV words is crucial for ensuring the robustness of NLP models. Here are some strategies:

1. **Substitution:**
   - Replace OOV words with a special token (e.g., `<UNK>`) during preprocessing.
   - Train the model on a dataset containing a large vocabulary, including OOV words.

2. **Word-piece Tokenization:**
   - Use word-piece tokenization to split OOV words into subwords or characters.
   - Train the model on subwords, which helps capture the meaning of OOV words.

3. **Out-of-vocabulary Modeling:**
   - Use a separate embedding layer for OOV words, which captures their meaning based on surrounding words.
   - Train the model to predict the OOV embedding vector conditioned on the context.

**Source Code Example:**
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load pre-trained subword tokenizer
tokenizer = tf.keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer(char_level=True, oov_token='<UNK>')

# Tokenize user input
user_input = "I want to go to the <UNK> park."
tokenized_input = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([user_input])

# Load pre-trained model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('path/to/model.h5')

# Predict OOV word embedding
ooov_word = tokenizer.sequences_to_texts([tokenized_input[0]])[0].split()[1]
ooov_embedding = model.layers[-1].get_weights()[0][tokenizer.word_index[ooov_word]]
```

#### 3. How to optimize the generation of natural language instructions?

**Question:**
Explain different optimization techniques for generating natural language instructions.

**Answer:**
Optimizing the generation of natural language instructions can enhance model performance and reduce computational overhead. Here are some optimization techniques:

1. **Dynamic Composing:**
   - Use a dynamic programming approach to find the optimal sequence of actions and phrases.
   - Break down the instruction generation process into smaller subproblems.

2. ** beam Search:**
   - Use beam search to explore multiple possible sequences during generation, rather than a single greedy approach.
   - Balance the diversity of generated instructions with the quality of the instructions.

3. **Adaptive Sampling:**
   - Use adaptive sampling techniques to adjust the sampling rate based on the confidence of the model.
   - Increase the sampling rate when the model is confident and decrease it when the model is uncertain.

**Source Code Example:**
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load pre-trained model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('path/to/model.h5')

# Generate instructions using beam search
sequences = model.predict(input_sequence, batch_size=batch_size, steps=beam_size)

# Extract top-k highest-probability sequences
top_k_sequences = [tf.argmax(sequences[i], axis=-1).numpy() for i in range(len(sequences))]

# Post-process the generated sequences to form natural language instructions
generated_instructions = [tokenizer.decode(seq) for seq in top_k_sequences]
```
