Each question will be accompanied by an in-depth explanation and a comprehensive answer with source code examples. Here's the outline of the blog post:

## Creativity and Knowledge: Foundations of Breakthrough Thinking

### 1. Algorithm and Data Structure Questions

#### 1.1. Merge Sorted Arrays

**Question:**
Given two sorted arrays, merge them into a single sorted array.

**Answer:**
You can use the two-pointer technique to merge the arrays.

**Example:**
```go
func mergeSortedArrays(nums1, nums2 []int) []int {
    p1, p2, p3 := 0, 0, 0
    for p1 < len(nums1) && p2 < len(nums2) {
        if nums1[p1] < nums2[p2] {
            nums1[p3] = nums1[p1]
            p1++
        } else {
            nums1[p3] = nums2[p2]
            p2++
        }
        p3++
    }
    for p1 < len(nums1) {
        nums1[p3] = nums1[p1]
        p1++
        p3++
    }
    for p2 < len(nums2) {
        nums1[p3] = nums2[p2]
        p2++
        p3++
    }
    return nums1
}
```

**Explanation:**
The algorithm initializes three pointers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` to iterate through the three subarrays (`nums1`, `nums2`, and the merged array `nums1`). It compares elements from `nums1` and `nums2`, copying the smaller one to the merged array.

### 2. Coding Questions

#### 2.1. Two Sum

**Question:**
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

**Answer:**
Use a hash table to store the complement of each element as you iterate through the array.

**Example:**
```go
func twoSum(nums []int, target int) []int {
    hash := make(map[int]int)
    for i, num := range nums {
        complement := target - num
        if j, ok := hash[complement]; ok {
            return []int{j, i}
        }
        hash[num] = i
    }
    return nil
}
```

**Explanation:**
The function iterates through the array and for each element, it calculates the complement needed to reach the target. It then checks if the complement is in the hash table. If it is, it returns the indices. Otherwise, it adds the current element and its index to the hash table.

### 3. System Design Questions

#### 3.1. Design Twitter

**Question:**
Design a Twitter system that can generate a continuous stream of tweets for users and handle the timeline.

**Answer:**
Design the system with a focus on scalability and performance, using data structures like hash tables, queues, and priority queues.

**Example:**
```go
type User struct {
    ID       int
    Tweets   []int
    Following map[int]bool
}

type Twitter struct {
    Users    map[int]*User
    Tweets   []int
}

func Constructor() Twitter {
    return Twitter{
        Users:    make(map[int]*User),
        Tweets:   make([]int, 0),
    }
}

func (t *Twitter) PostTweet(userId int, tweetId int) {
    user, exists := t.Users[userId]
    if !exists {
        user = &User{ID: userId}
        t.Users[userId] = user
    }
    user.Tweets = append(user.Tweets, tweetId)
    t.Tweets = append(t.Tweets, tweetId)
}

func (t *Twitter) GetNewsFeed(userId int) []int {
    feed := make([]int, 0)
    // Sort tweets by timestamp
    // ...
    // Append top tweets to feed
    return feed
}
```

**Explanation:**
The Twitter system consists of a `User` struct representing each user, a `Twitter` struct managing users and tweets, and methods to post tweets and get a news feed. The news feed method should be optimized to return the most recent tweets from the user's followers and potentially prioritize popular content.

### 4. Behavioral and Culture Questions

#### 4.1. Why Do You Want to Work Here?

**Question:**
Why do you want to work at our company?

**Answer:**
Focus on the company's mission, culture, and growth potential.

**Example:**
```text
As an AI expert, I am drawn to your company because of its innovative approach to using AI to solve complex problems. Your commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology aligns with my passion for developing cutting-edge solutions. Additionally, your collaborative and inclusive culture fosters an environment where creativity and knowledge are highly valued, which is crucial for fostering breakthrough thinking.
```

**Explanation:**
In your answer, highlight specific aspects of the company that resonate with your personal and professional goals, demonstrating that you have done your research and genuinely want to contribute to the company's success.
