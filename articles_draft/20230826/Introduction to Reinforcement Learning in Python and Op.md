# 1.简介
  

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning approach where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment. The goal of RL is to learn the optimal set of actions that will maximize long-term reward received from the agent over time. In this article we will explore how reinforcement learning works using Python and open AI gym environment library.

# 2.基本概念术语说明
1. Agent: A software or hardware device that interacts with the environment in order to achieve specific goals.

2. Environment: An outside world that provides the agent with information about what it should do, how good its action can be predicted, and whether it has reached the terminal state or not. It also gives feedback on the agent’s performance at each step to guide the learning process.

3. Action: An input to the agent that influences its behavior. Actions may include choosing a direction to move in a game or selecting different options in a decision-making scenario. 

4. State: The current conditions of the environment that the agent observes. It includes everything visible to the agent including objects, locations, sensors, etc.

5. Reward: The numerical value assigned to the agent for performing a desired action within the environment. The rewards are typically positive when the agent achieves its goals and negative otherwise. 

6. Policy: A mapping between states and probabilities of selecting actions based on those states. The policy determines which action the agent takes given any particular state.

## Q-Learning Algorithm
Q-learning algorithm is one of the most popular Reinforcement Learning algorithms used to train agents in various environments. Here's how it works:

1. Initialize the Q function table to zeros with dimensions (number_of_states x number_of_actions). Each cell represents the utility of taking an action in a particular state.

2. Set the discount factor gamma = 0.9

3. Repeat until convergence:

   a. Select a starting state s.

   b. Take an action a' using the epsilon greedy policy (with exploration rate ε), i.e., choose either a uniform random action or the best known action according to the current Q values.

    c. Execute action a' in the environment and observe the next state s', the reward r(s,a,s') and the fact whether the episode terminated (episode ends) or not.

    d. Update the Q table entry q[s,a] += alpha*(r(s,a,s') + gamma*max(q[s']) - q[s,a])
   
   e. If episode ended, go back to step 3b. Otherwise continue to step 4.

The above steps outline the basic idea behind Q-learning. Let's now implement it using Python and OpenAI Gym environment library.

### Implementation using Python and OpenAI Gym Environment Library 
We will use the FrozenLake-v0 environment provided by OpenAI Gym as our example problem. This is a simple gridworld where the agent must navigate towards the treasure without moving into the water or falling into a hole. We have implemented the Q-learning algorithm below to solve this problem.


```python
import gym
import numpy as np
env = gym.make('FrozenLake-v0')
np.random.seed(0)

num_episodes = 2000 # Number of training episodes
alpha = 0.1 # Learning rate
gamma = 0.9 # Discount factor
epsilon = 0.1 # Exploration rate
num_steps = 100 # Maximum number of steps per episode

def get_action(state):
    if np.random.uniform() < epsilon:
        return env.action_space.sample() 
    else:
        q_values = [qtable[state][i] for i in range(env.action_space.n)] 
        return np.argmax(q_values)
    
def update_q(state, action, new_state, reward):
    old_value = qtable[state][action]
    future_rewards = [qtable[new_state][i] for i in range(env.action_space.n)]
    next_best_reward = np.max(future_rewards)
    new_value = (1 - alpha)*old_value + alpha*(reward + gamma*next_best_reward)
    qtable[state][action] = new_value
    
    return new_value

qtable = np.zeros((env.observation_space.n, env.action_space.n))
for i in range(num_episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    total_reward = 0
    
    for j in range(num_steps):
        
        # Get action under current policy
        action = get_action(state)
        
        # Take action in environment and observe next state and reward
        new_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        
        # Update Q table
        update_q(state, action, new_state, reward)
        
        # Update variables for next iteration
        state = new_state
        total_reward += reward
        
        # Check if episode has finished
        if done == True:
            break
            
    print("Episode {}/{} || Reward: {}".format(i+1, num_episodes, total_reward))
    
print("Training completed.")
```

In the code above, we first create an instance of the frozen lake environment and define some parameters like learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate, maximum number of steps per episode, etc. Then we initialize a NumPy array called "qtable" with dimensions (number_of_states x number_of_actions) and set all entries to zero. Next, we start the loop that runs for the specified number of episodes. For each episode, we reset the environment and then take actions according to the current epsilon greedy policy until we reach the end of the episode. During each step of the episode, we use the Q-learning formula to compute the updated value of the previous state-action pair and store it in the Q table. Finally, once we complete an episode, we update the variables for the next iteration of the loop. Once the loop completes, we check if the training was successful by running a few test episodes.
