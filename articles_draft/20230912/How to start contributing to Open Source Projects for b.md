# 1.简介
  

Open source projects are a great way to learn and improve your coding skills, increase your career opportunities, and help you get feedback from others. However, it can be challenging at first to understand how to contribute effectively. Therefore, in this article we will explain step by step the process of starting contribution to open source projects as an absolute beginner. 

We assume that readers have basic knowledge about programming languages like Python or JavaScript. We will also use Git as our version control system throughout the article. If you don't already have Git installed on your machine, please follow these steps before reading:

1. Install Git: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
2. Configure Git: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git

If you have any questions during the setup, feel free to ask us!

# 2. Start with understanding the basics
Before diving into the details of contributing to open source projects, let's first understand some fundamental concepts and terminologies used in software development. These include code repositories, version control systems (VCS), issue trackers, pull requests, branches, commits, etc. 

## Code Repositories
A code repository is a place where all the project files including codes, documentation, designs, data sets, configuration files, build scripts, etc., are stored. You can create a new repository in GitHub or clone an existing one using git command line tool. Here are some commands to perform various operations on repositories:

```bash
# To create a new local repository and connect it to remote repo in Github:
$ git init
$ git remote add origin <remote_repo_url>
$ git push -u origin master

# To clone an existing repository locally:
$ git clone <repository_url>

# To update local repository with changes from remote repository:
$ git fetch --all
$ git rebase FETCH_HEAD

# To check status of repository:
$ git status

# To make changes to repository:
$ nano <file_name>
$ git add.
$ git commit -m "commit message"

# To push local commits to remote repository:
$ git push origin master
```

In general, when working on a project collaboratively, it is always recommended to keep the codebase organized through good coding practices and use version control tools such as Git to manage changes efficiently. This helps ensure that everyone is working on the same file at the same time and avoids conflicts among different developers.

## Version Control Systems (VCS)
Version control systems are programs that record changes made to a set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later if needed. A VCS allows multiple users to work simultaneously on the same codebase without stepping on each other’s toes, which makes collaboration easier. The most commonly used version control system is Git, but there are others such as Mercurial, SVN, etc. 

Here are some important terms and commands associated with Git:

**Repository:** The main directory of a project containing all its files, history, and metadata. Each repository has two primary branches: `master` and `develop`. Developers typically work on the `develop` branch while regularly merging their changes into `master`, making sure they pass all tests and meet certain quality standards before release.

**Commit:** A single unit of change committed to the repository. Each commit contains a unique ID, timestamp, and description of what was changed. Commit messages should be descriptive and concise. They must not contain sensitive information since it may become public. Good commit messages often include a reference to a JIRA ticket number and/or story name.

**Branch:** A lightweight pointer to one version of the repository. Branches allow for parallel development, feature testing, bug fixes, and experimentation. When creating a new branch, it is advised to give it a meaningful name reflective of the purpose of the branch, e.g. `feature/<ticketnumber>-<description>`.

**Merge:** Two or more branches are combined together to produce a new version of the codebase. During merge conflict resolution, the developer takes responsibility for resolving any potential issues arising from conflicting changes introduced by different developers. Once merged, the resulting code base is considered stable and ready for deployment.

**Tag:** A label placed on a particular commit to mark a significant milestone in the development timeline. Tags serve as a useful way to preserve specific versions of the codebase, allowing teams to go back to previous releases easily if necessary.

Commands related to Git include:

```bash
# Initialize a new repository:
$ git init

# Clone an existing repository:
$ git clone <repository_url>

# Create a new branch:
$ git checkout -b <branch_name>

# Checkout an existing branch:
$ git checkout <branch_name>

# Merge one branch into another:
$ git merge <source_branch>

# View the log of recent changes:
$ git log

# Search for changes within a date range:
$ git log --since="2 weeks ago"

# Reset current HEAD to specified state:
$ git reset --hard <commit_id>

# Add untracked files to index:
$ git add.

# Commit staged changes:
$ git commit -m "<commit_message>"

# Push local branch to remote repository:
$ git push origin <branch_name>
```

Overall, keeping track of changes through a clear versioning system is essential for maintaining reliability and scalability across a large team of developers. By following best coding practices and utilizing industry-standard VCS tools, you can easily achieve efficient collaboration between multiple developers, leading to better results than traditional methods.
