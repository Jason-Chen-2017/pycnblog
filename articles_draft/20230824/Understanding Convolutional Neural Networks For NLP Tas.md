# 1.简介
  

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become very popular in Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to their ability to extract features from text and then apply machine learning algorithms on them. In this article we will discuss how CNNs are used for sentiment analysis of text data with a focus on understanding the different components involved. We will also explore some key differences between CNN-based models and traditional models such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM). 

In order to fully understand CNNs for NLP tasks, it is important to first understand the basic concepts related to natural language processing including tokens, vocabulary, stemming/lemmatization, bag-of-words model, etc. If you don’t already know these concepts, please refer to previous articles or tutorials to learn about them before proceeding further. Also, it is assumed that readers are familiar with deep learning terminology such as activation functions, loss functions, mini-batch gradient descent optimization technique, regularization techniques, overfitting and underfitting, etc. 


# 2. Concepts & Terminologies: Tokens, Vocabulary, Stemming/Lemmatization, Bag-of-Words Model
Before going into the details of CNNs and its applications for NLP, let us briefly cover some of the fundamental concepts associated with NLP.


### Tokenization ###
Tokenization refers to the process of dividing a sentence or document into individual words or smaller units called tokens. It is essential because it helps to simplify the subsequent processes by breaking down larger chunks of information into more manageable pieces. The main purpose of tokenizing is to convert the raw input data into a format which can be easily processed by an algorithm. Common ways to tokenize text include word level tokenization, character level tokenization, subword tokenization and byte pair encoding (BPE) based methods. Here's an example using BPE tokenization method:

```
input_text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
bpe_model = BytePairEncoding.train(input_text, vocab_size=10000, min_frequency=1) # Train BPE model with custom settings
tokenized_text = bpe_model.encode(input_text) # Apply BPE encoding on the input text
print(tokenized_text)
```

Output: 
```
['▁the', '▁qui', 'ck', '▁br', 'own', '▁fox', '▁jump','s', '▁over', '▁the', '▁lazy', '▁dog', '.']
```


### Vocabulary ###
A vocabulary is a collection of all possible words or terms used in a particular corpus or dataset. The vocabulary includes both the unique words present in the training set as well as any special symbols such as punctuations or stop words. A common way to create a vocabulary for NLP tasks is to use the bag-of-words model where each document or sequence is represented as a vector of frequency counts for every distinct term in the vocabulary. This approach ignores the ordering and position of words within the documents. 

Here's an example:

Suppose our corpus consists of two documents: 
 - “The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog”
 - “I love watching movies during the day”
 
First, we need to tokenize these sentences into separate words or tokens:

```
doc1 = ['The', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'jumped', 'over', 'the', 'lazy', 'dog'].
doc2 = ['I', 'love', 'watching','movies', 'during', 'the', 'day'].
```

Next, we need to build our vocabulary. To do so, we remove duplicates, sort the remaining tokens alphabetically, and assign integer indices starting from 0 to each token. 

| Token | Index |
|---|---|
|<START>  |  0|
|dog    |  1|
|dry    |  2|
|fox    |  3|
